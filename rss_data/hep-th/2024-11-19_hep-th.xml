      <title>Revisiting Scattering Enhancement from the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a charged particle scattering off of an Aharonov-Bohm cosmic string. A classic computation gave an infinite total scattering cross section, leading to a Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement which can have important implications on baryon number asymmetry in the early universe. However, unlike the Callan-Rubakov effect, the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is topological and thus it is surprising that it leads to such a dramatic dynamical effect for single particle scattering. We reexamine this old problem through the modern lens of generalized global symmetries by embedding Aharanov-Bohm strings in a discrete gauge theory. We show that the scattering cross section is suppressed by the core size and there is thus no Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, subregions of the CFT allow for the recovery of subregions of the bulk. The python's lunch (PL) conjecture asserts that in some settings this reconstruction has a large complexity of $\text{poly}(1/G_N)e^{\Delta A_{\text{PL}}/8G_N}$, where $\Delta A_{\text{PL}}$ is an area difference of bulk extremal surfaces. Using tools from cryptography, we argue that the PL conjecture has implications for correlation in the boundary CFT. We find that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by $\Delta A_{\text{PL}}$. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives an easily checked geometrical consequence of the PL conjecture. We consider explicit python's lunch geometries and study when this prediction holds. In an example constructed in vacuum AdS$_{2+1}$, we find there is a tension between the expected behaviour of correlation and a naive statement of the PL conjecture; we discuss how this tension may be resolved through refinements of the conjecture. We study further examples in AdS$_{2+1}$ including the defect geometry, BTZ black hole, and a geometry with a static end-of-the-world (ETW) brane, and find agreement with expected behaviour assuming the PL conjecture.</description>

      <title>Shear transport in far-from-equilibrium isotropization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We holographically study the far-from-equilibrium isotropization dynamics of the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The dual gravitational background is driven to be out of equilibrium and anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions. At late times, the system relaxes and asymptotically approaches a static configuration. The large initial energy densities accelerate the isotropization significantly compared to the initial geometry corresponding to the supersymmetric Yang-Mills vacuum. We analyze shear transport during isotropization by directly computing the time-dependent stress tensor, which is now a nonlinear function of the shear rate. The shear viscosity far from equilibrium displays much richer dynamics than its near-equilibrium counterpart. Moreover, we uncover that the equilibrium viscosity-to-entropy ratio at late times depends on the details of the quench function and the initial data, which could be due to a resummation of the hydrodynamic description. In particular, this ratio can be parametrically smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound calculated from linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Phases and triple(multiple) point: critical phenomena around the AD singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuing with our previous series of work, we present a case study of the critical phenomena around Argyres-Douglas singularity of ${\cal N} =2$ susy made at $(A_1, A_{4k-1} ), k =1, 2$ realized by one-unitary matrix model. We determine the phase diagram, which is recast into LEEA of $\mathcal{N}=2$, 4d gauge theory by the 0d-4d connection. There are three distinct phases, each corresponding to an eigenvalue distribution with 0, 1, and 2 gaps. These form an entire phase diagram with a triple point. Examining the behavior of the planar free energy, we show, among other things,that the transition line between 1- and 2-gap phases ending at the triple point is the $k=2$ multicritical one.</description>

      <title>Collective field theory of gauged multi-matrix models: Integrating out off-diagonal strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two-matrix toy model with a BFSS-like interaction term using the collective field formalism. The main technical simplification is obtained by gauge-fixing first, and integrating out the off-diagonal elements, before changing to the collective field variable. We show that the resulting (2+1)-dimensional collective field action has novel features with respect to non-locality, and that we need to add a mass term to get a time-local potential. As is expected, one recovers the single matrix quantum mechanical collective field Hamiltonian in the proper limit.</description>

      <title>Rational QCD loop amplitudes and quantum theories on twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how curing an anomaly of the twistor uplift of self-dual Yang-Mills theory implies linear relations among one-loop, $n$-gluon, color-ordered subamplitudes in QCD, when all $n$ gluon helicities are positive, or when exactly one is negative. We compute the number of linearly independent subamplitudes as determined by these relations, in terms of unsigned Stirling numbers. Then we use a momentum-twistor parametrization to show that there are no further linear dependencies.</description>

      <title>Positive thinking: A search for energy conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy conditions are attempts to summarise the properties of realistic descriptions of matter via constraints on the energy-momentum tensor. This is, for example, useful when one wants to understand the types of spacetime geometry that can be realised in general relativity. However, it is currently unknown what (if any) energy condition a realistic quantum theory interacting gravitationally would obey.
  In this thesis, we provide support for the conformally invariant averaged null energy condition (CANEC), a particular proposal towards a more generally valid energy condition. We motivate our interest in the CANEC by reviewing the role of the null energy condition (NEC) in classical gravity, summarising a general proof of the averaged NEC (ANEC) for quantum field theories in flat spacetime, and going over a holographic proof of the CANEC in a class of curved spacetimes. The context in which the CANEC applies is then extended with two proofs: a holographic proof in two types of spacetime to which the existing proof does not apply, and a field theoretical proof for conformal field theories in conformally flat spacetimes.
  Finally, we consider light-ray operators in Minkowski spacetime. The connection between these operators and the CANEC is that the CANEC on a lightcone in Minkowski spacetime constrains a light-ray operator for an even number of spacetime dimensions $d$. Via an explicit computation, we show that many light-ray operators are positive-semidefinite in a class of non-minimally coupled but otherwise free real scalar field theories. One of the operators for which this holds is the CANEC-operator on the lightcone for even $d$.</description>

      <title>Type-II backgrounds from deformed coset CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a plethora of type-II supergravity solutions featuring AdS factors in their geometries, derived from integrable deformations of coset CFTs. Specifically, we uplift the $\lambda$-deformed models of $SO(4)_k/SO(3)_k$ and $SO(5)_k/SO(4)_k$, including the non-compact version of the latter. Requiring reality for the backgrounds imposes bounds on the deformation parameter. As a result, some of the solutions do not admit non-Abelian T-dual limit.</description>

      <title>An extremal black hole with a unique ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent computations in gravity suggest that non-supersymmetric extremal black holes lack any sizeable ground state degeneracy. We confirm this for D-brane description of non-supersymmetric 4-charge extremal black holes in N=8 string theory. The microscopic description comprises four stacks of D-branes wrapping various cycles of the internal six-torus and intersecting at a point. The orientations of the stacks are such that supersymmetry is broken completely. We construct the low energy worldline Lagrangian for the brane system, which is seen to have 32 Goldstinos and 28 Goldstones. The Hamiltonian has a unique ground state, which carries a non-zero energy implying the absence of any truly extremal state.</description>

      <title>Light fields in various patches of de Sitter space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start with the consideration of the loop effects for light fields with non-zero mass in the expanding Poincar\'e patch of de Sitter space-time. We derive the Dyson-Schwinger equation, which sums up the leading infrared (growing with time) loop corrections in certain limit for small initial perturbations above the Bunch-Davies state. The solution of this equation shows the destiny of the initial state at the future infinity. Then we discuss the case of the contracting Poincar\'e patch and global de Sitter space-time and briefly the case of different initial conditions in the expanding Poincar\'e patch.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <title>"Metric-affine-like" generalization of YM (mal-YM): main idea and results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, we build a generalization of the $U(n)$ Yang-Mills theory obtained by abandoning the condition of covariant constancy of the Hermitian form in the fibers: $\nabla_a g_{\alpha\beta'} \ne 0$. So this theory is a simpler analogue of the well-known metric-affine gravity with $\nabla_a g_{bc} \ne 0$. In our case the connection $\nabla_a$ and the Hermitian form $g_{\alpha\beta'}$ are two independent variables, and the total curvature and the total potential are no longer anti-Hermitian matrices: in addition to the usual $\boldsymbol{F}_{ab}$ and $\boldsymbol{A}_a$ they also obtain new Hermitian parts $\boldsymbol{G}_{ab}$ and $\boldsymbol{B}_a$. It is shown that the Hermitian form $g_{\alpha\beta'}$ is a Higgs field breaking the general $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ gauge symmetry to $U(n)$, and its perturbations are Goldstone bosons which can be eliminated from the theory by redefining other fields. The result is a theory consisting of two non-trivially interacting gauge fields, one of which can be made massive while the other remains massless. Letting the mass of the second gauge field tend to infinity allows one to restore the usual YM.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information of a cosmic qubit undergoing non-Markovian de Sitter evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of thermalization process for an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector in de Sitter space. We derive the full dynamics of the detector in the context of open quantum system, neither using Markovian or RWA approximations. We utilize quantum Fisher information (QFI) for Hubble parameter estimation, as a process function to distinguish the thermalization paths in detector Hilbert space, determined by its local properties, e.g., detector energy gap and its initial state preparation, or global spacetime geometry. We find that the non-Markovian contribution in general reduces the QFI comparing with Markovian approximated solution. Regarding to arbitrary initial states, the late-time QFI would converge to an asymptotic value. In particular, we are interested in the background field in the one parameter family of $\alpha$-vacua in de Sitter space. We show that for general $\alpha$-vacuum choices, the asymptotic values of converged QFI are significantly suppressed, comparing to previous known results for Bunch-Davies vacuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>Hidden Symmetries of 4D N=2 Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global symmetries of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory and its marginal deformations. The process of orbifolding to obtain an N=2 theory would appear to break the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ R-symmetry down to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$. We show that the broken generators can be recovered by moving beyond the Lie algebraic setting to that of a Lie algebroid. This remains true when marginally deforming away from the orbifold point by allowing the couplings of the $ \mathrm{SU}(N)\times \mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge groups to vary independently. The information about the marginal deformation is captured by a Drinfeld-type twist of this $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ Lie algebroid. The twist is read off from the F- and D- terms, and thus directly from the Lagrangian. Even though at the orbifold point the algebraic structure is associative, it becomes non-associative after the marginal deformation. We explicitly check that the planar Lagrangian of the theory is invariant under this twisted version of the $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ algebroid and we discuss implications of this hidden symmetry for the spectrum of the N=2 theory.</description>

      <title>Constrained Deflection Angle and Shadows of Rotating Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent Event Horizon Telescope findings, we investigate constrained optics of rotating black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar gravity theory. Precisely, we mainly study the parameter effects on two relevant optical concepts being the shadow and deflection angle. Using the Hamilton-Jacobi algorithm, we find certain shadow geometries being corroborated by observational data once appropriate constraints on a stringy coupling parameter $\beta$ are imposed. For such constrained regions of the black hole moduli space, we compute the deflection angle of light rays near to such black holes. Concretely, we show that this optical quantity can be split into two contributions describing the absence and the presence of the coupling parameter $\beta$. Then, we discuss and analyse such an optical quantity in terms of $\beta$ contributions.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical quantization of M5 brane probes wrapped on $\textrm{AdS}_3\times S^3$ and defect anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two supersymmetric M5 brane probe solutions in $\textrm{AdS}_7 \times S^4$ and one in $\textrm{AdS}_4 \times S^7$ that all have the $\textrm{AdS}_3 \times S^3$ world-volume geometry. The values of the classical action of the first two M5 probes (with $S^3$ in $\textrm{AdS}_7$ or in $S^4$) are related to the leading $N^2$ parts in the anomaly b-coefficient in the (2,0) theory corresponding to a spherical surface defect in symmetric or antisymmetric $SU(N)$ representations. We present a detailed computation of the corresponding one-loop M5 brane partition functions finding that they vanish (in a particular regularization). This implies the vanishing of the order $N^0$ part in the b-anomaly coefficients, in agreement with earlier predictions for their exact values. It remains, however, a puzzle of how to reproduce the non-vanishing order $N$ terms in these coefficients within the semiclassical M5-brane probe setup.</description>

      <title>Coherent States in Gauge Theories: Topological Defects and Other Classical Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formulation of coherent states as of consistent quantum description of classical configurations in the BRST-invariant quantization of electrodynamics. The quantization with proper gauge-fixing is performed on the vacuum of the theory, whereas other backgrounds are obtained as BRST-invariant coherent states. One of the key insights is the possibility of constructing the coherent states of pure-gauge configurations. This provides a coherent state understanding of topologically non-trivial configurations in gauge theories, and makes number of features, such as the suppression of transitions between topologically-distinct sectors, very transparent at full quantum level. As an example, we construct the Nielsen-Olesen string as a BRST-invariant coherent state. The Abelian pure-gauge configurations can also be viewed as useful analogs for a set of space-times related by coordinate reparameterizations in General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although it is long believed that vanishing of chiral central charges of a 2d conformal field theory (CFT) implies the existence of conformal boundary conditions, there are yet higher obstructions. In this paper, we focus on 2d rational CFTs, for which we identify a series of obstructions, known as higher central charges. We also discuss its implication for lattice realizations and the generalization with global symmetries.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the worldline quantum field theory formalism, we compute the radiation-reacted impulse, scattering angle, radiated energy and recoil of a classical black hole (or neutron star) scattering event at fifth post-Minkowskian and sub-leading self-force orders (5PM-1SF). This state-of-the-art four-loop computation employs advanced integration-by-parts and differential equation technology, and is considerably more challenging than the conservative 5PM-1SF counterpart. As compared with the conservative 5PM-1SF, in the radiation sector Calabi-Yau three-fold periods appear and contribute to the radiated energy and recoil observables. We give an extensive exposition of the canonicalization of the differential equations and provide details on boundary integrations, Feynman rules, and integration-by-parts strategies. Comparisons to numerical relativity are also performed.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution in spherically reduced 2D semiclassical gravity with negative central charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the semiclassical Schwarzschild geometry in the Boulware quantum state in the framework of two-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity. The classical model is defined by the spherical reduction of Einstein's gravity sourced with conformal scalar fields. The expectation value of the stress-energy tensor in the Boulware state is singular at the classical horizon of the Schwarzschild spacetime, but when backreaction effects are considered, previous results have shown that the 2D geometry is horizonless and described by a non-symmetric wormhole with a curvature singularity on the other side of the throat. In this work we show that reversing the sign of the central charge of the conformal matter removes the curvature singularity of the 2D backreacted geometry, which happens to be horizonless and asymptotically flat. This result is consistent with a similar analysis recently performed for the CGHS model. We also argue the physical significance of negative central charges in conformal anomalies from a four-dimensional perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the static potentials induced by vacuum domains for various representations in SU($4$) Yang-Mills theory within the framework of the domain structure model. By studying the interactions within the vacuum domains, we can uncover fundamental properties of the static potentials. It appears that attractions within the vacuum domains strongly adhere to Casimir scaling at intermediate distances. Conversely, the repulsions within the vacuum domains may decompose them into center vortices with the lowest magnitude of center vortex fluxes, thereby exhibiting $N$-ality at asymptotic distances.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the optical band gap in massive Dirac-like systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the mass renormalization for massive Dirac-like systems in (2+1)D due to the electron-phonon interaction at finite temperatures within the large-$N$ expansion. Our model combines the low-energy limit of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and the electron-phonon interaction in a two-dimensional material. Hence, we obtain a massive Dirac-like field interacting with a two-component vector field $\mathcal{A}_i$, describing the phonon field. This provides a one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature and, from this, we calculate the renormalized band gap $m_R$. Thereafter, our effective model is applied for describing the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), such as MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$, where a good agreement is found for reasonable values of our ultraviolet cutoff $\Lambda\approx 1$ eV. The main result establishes that, at low temperatures, $m_R$ is almost constant while for higher temperatures it is a decreasing linear function of the temperature $T$. We obtain that $m_R$ decreases about $\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV whenever we increase the temperature from $\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, which is consistent with recent experimental measurements. We also estimate the temperature at which we should observe the transition to the linear regime and obtain typical values in the interval $\approx[110,150]$ K from the four materials we have considered.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Trace Formula from Complex Periodic Orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller trace formula establishes a profound connection between the quantum spectrum and classical periodic orbits. However, its application is limited by its reliance on the semiclassical saddle point approximation. In this work, we explore the full quantum version of the trace formula using the Lefschetz thimble method by incorporating complexified periodic orbits. Upon complexification, classical real periodic orbits are transformed into cycles on compact Riemann surfaces. Our key innovation lies in the simultaneous complexification of the periods of cycles, resulting in a fully quantum trace formula that accounts for all contributions classified by the homology classes of the associated Riemann surfaces. This formulation connects the quantum spectrum to contributions across all complex time directions, encompassing all relevant homology classes. Our approach naturally unifies and extends two established methodologies: periodic orbits in real time, as in Gutzwiller's original work, and quantum tunneling in imaginary time, as in the instanton method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of background classical sources affects a quantum field theory significantly in different ways. Neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon that confirms that neutrinos are massive fermions in nature, a celebrated result in modern physics. Neutrino oscillation plays an important role in many astrophysical observations. However, the interactions between the background classical sources with neutrinos are not often considered. In the present article, we show the effect of some classical sources, namely matter currents, electromagnetic waves, torsion, and gravitational waves on neutrino oscillation. It is shown explicitly that the above sources can change the helicity state of neutrinos during neutrino oscillation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how pilot-wave theory points to new physics, beyond quantum mechanics, in three distinct ways. First, generalised cosmological initial conditions, departing from the Born rule, can lead to observable anomalies in the cosmic microwave background and in relic cosmological particles. Second, a breakdown of the Born rule in the deep quantum-gravity regime, with gravitational corrections that render the Born rule semiclassically unstable, can create anomalies in Hawking radiation from evaporating black holes. Third, a regularised equation of motion that remains finite at nodes of the wave function generates corrections to the Born rule at short distances, while a natural time-dependent generalisation implies an instability of quantum equilibrium at short times, effects which may be observable in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest on the possible future scenarios the universe could have has grew substantially with breakthroughs on late-time acceleration. Holographic dark energy (HDE) presents a very interesting approach towards addressing late-time acceleration, presenting an intriguing interface of ideas from quantum gravity and cosmology. In this work we present an extensive discussion of possible late-time scenarios, focusing on rips and similar events, in a universe with holographic dark energy. We discuss these events in the realm of the generalized Nojiri-Odintsov cutoff and also for the more primitive holographic cutoffs like Hubble, particle and event horizon cutoffs. We also discuss the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics and various energy conditions in these regimes. Our work points towards the idea that it is not possible to have alternatives of the big rip consistently in the simpler HDE cutoffs, and shows the flexibility of the generalized HDE cutoff as well.</description>

      <title>Connection between gravity and quantum mechanics: an algebraic approach to cosmological issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an algebraic framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light, specifically in the form of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantum attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, and the formation of large-scale structures. The model also investigates quantized characteristics of black holes, such as mass, entropy, and temperature, suggesting that quantum processes are fundamental to black hole mechanics. By addressing issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and proposes that PBHs may serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that understanding black hole physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical paradoxes for the ultimate unification of quantum mechanics with gravity.</description>

      <title>CRT gauge symmetry in two-sheet de Sitter universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to understand CRT symmetry as gauge symmetry in holographic de Sitter universe involving a pair of mirror universes, in which frame there are two times going in two opposite temporal directions each. The CRT symmetry is global with respect to the big bang for these two-sheet universes. In this construction the presence of an observer is equivalent to taking a CRT gauge, thus breaks the global CRT symmetry. In de Sitter space the observer need not to carry a clock, as the clock is equivalent to a way telling the temporal order of events. The role of a clock can be replaced by redshift, like in FLRW cosmology, points to the adaptability of measurement in cosmological contexts. This concept drives us to write gauge invariant formulas, i.e. correlation function [O(t-w),O(-t-w)]=0 identically for w the time from the observer to big bang. In this spirit, the gauge invariant formula overlaps with the fact that the Hilbert space is real in holographic de Sitter universe. The observer is highly entangled with the rest of the universe in a thermofield double state, thus contributes to no extra degrees of freedom. We show that the time $w$ to the big bang is not real singularity, but an unavoidable focus point along the timelike geodesic congruence of the observer. Our result highlights the role of observer in understanding quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Quantization of Palatini Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Palatini action is based on vector-valued one forms or frames and SL(2,C) connections on R^4. Using the spacetime split of R^4 as a direct sum of R^3 and R^1, the Gauss law in this paper is treated on a Hilbert space. This is achieved by noting that quantum operators act on a complex Hilbert space and SL(2,C) is just the complexification of the compact SU(2) in the self-dual (1/2,0) representation used for the Ashtekar variables. This observation enables a treatment of small and large gauge transformations and superselection sectors. An explicit representation of theta vacua and their attendant 'spin-isospin mixing' are also shown. It is argued that the Gauss law algebra replaces that of diffeomorphisms in the Palatini approach : operators implementing the latter with the correct algebraic relations do not seem available. (Those obtained by multiplying Gauss law operators with fields do not have the correct commutators.)</description>

Abstract: We investigate the degrees of freedom of New General Relativity. This theory is a three-parameter theory and is classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry of $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}], we investigated the degrees of freedom in types of NGR that are interests for describing gravity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. In this work, we focus on unveiling those numbers in all other types to complete the analysis of NGR. After providing the Hamiltonian formulation of NGR, we perform the analysis on Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 according to the method that is provided in the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}]. Then we unveil that the degrees of freedom of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 are five, null, and three, respectively. Type 4 and Type 9 have second-class constraint densities only. Type 7 has first-class constraint densities only, but which is over constraint. In every type, no bifurcation occurs unlikely to Type 8 in the previous work~[2410.15056[gr-qc]]. Finally, we summarize this work and give a concluding remark for this series of works.</description>

      <title>On the breakdown of dimensional reduction and supersymmetry in random-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the breakdown of the Parisi-Sourlas supersymmetry (SUSY) and of the dimensional-reduction (DR) property in the random field Ising and O($N$) models as a function of space dimension $d$ and/or number of components $N$. The functional renormalization group (FRG) predicts that this takes place below a critical line $d_{\rm DR}(N)$. We revisit the perturbative FRG results for the RFO($N$)M in $d=4+\epsilon$ and carry out a more comprehensive investigation of the nonperturbative FRG approximation for the RFIM. In light of this FRG description, we discuss the perturbative results in $\epsilon=6-d$ recently derived for the RFIM by Kaviraj, Rychkov, and Trevisani. We stress in particular that the disappearance of the SUSY/DR fixed point below $d_{\rm DR}$ arises as a consequence of the nonlinearity of the FRG equations and cannot be found via the perturbative expansion in $\epsilon=6-d$ (nor in $1/N$). We also provide an error bar on the value of the critical dimension $d_{\rm DR}$ for the RFIM, which we find around $5.11\pm0.09$, by studying several successive orders of the nonperturbative FRG approximation scheme.</description>

      <title>Resolving Verlinde's formula of logarithmic CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verlinde's formula for rational vertex operator algebras computes the fusion rules from the modular transformations of characters. In the non semisimple and non finite case, a logarithmic Verlinde formula has been proposed together with David Ridout. In this formula one replaces simple modules by their resolutions by standard modules. Here and under certain natural assumptions this conjecture is proven in generality.
  The result is illustrated in the examples of the singlet algebras and of the affine vertex algebra of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level, i.e. in particular the Verlinde conjectures in these cases are true. In the latter case it is also explained how to compute the actual fusion rules from knowledge of the Grothendieck ring.</description>

      <title>Ribbon categories of weight modules for affine $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at admissible levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the braided tensor category of finitely-generated weight modules for the simple affine vertex operator algebra $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at any admissible level $k$ is rigid and hence a braided ribbon category. The proof uses a recent result of the first two authors with Shimizu and Yadav on embedding a braided Grothendieck-Verdier category $\mathcal{C}$ into the Drinfeld center of the category of modules for a suitable commutative algebra $A$ in $\mathcal{C}$, in situations where the braided tensor category of local $A$-modules is rigid. Here, the commutative algebra $A$ is Adamovi\'{c}'s inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction of $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is the simple rational Virasoro vertex operator algebra at central charge $1-\frac{6(k+1)^2}{k+2}$ tensored with a half-lattice conformal vertex algebra. As a corollary, we also show that the category of finitely-generated weight modules for the $N = 2$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra at central charge $-6\ell-3$ is rigid for $\ell$ such that $(\ell+1)(k+2) = 1$.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and rigidity for weight modules over the simple admissible affine $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the categories of weight modules over the simple $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal vertex operator algebras at fractional admissible levels and central charges are rigid (and hence the categories of weight modules are braided ribbon categories) and that the decomposition formulae of fusion products of simple projective modules conjectured by Thomas Creutzig, David Ridout and collaborators hold (including when the decomposition involves summands that are indecomposable yet not simple). In addition to solving this old open problem, we develop new techniques for the construction of intertwining operators by means of integrating screening currents over certain cycles, which are expected to be of independent interest, due to their applicability to many other algebras. In the example of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ these new techniques allow us to give explicit formulae for a logarithmic intertwining operator from a pair of simple projective modules to the projective cover of the tensor unit, namely, the vertex operator algebra as a module over itself.</description>

      <title>What happens to topological invariants (and black holes) in singularity-free theories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potentials arising in ultraviolet-completed field theories can be devoid of singularities, and hence render spacetimes simply connected. This challenges the notion of topological invariants considered in such scenarios. We explore the classical implications for (i) electrodynamics in flat spacetime, (ii) ultrarelativistic gyratonic solutions of weak-field gravity, and (iii) exact electro-vacuum black hole solutions in general relativity. In linear theories, regularity spoils the character of topological invariants and leads to radius-dependent Aharanov--Bohm phases, which are potentially observable for large winding numbers. In general relativity, the physics is richer: The electromagnetic field can be regular and maintain its usual topological invariants, and the resulting geometry is a Reissner--Nordstr\"om black hole with a spacetime region of coordinate radius $\sim q^2/(GM)$ cut out. This guarantees the regularity of linear and quadratic curvature invariants ($\mathcal{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}^2$), but does not resolve singularities in invariants such as $\mathcal{R}^p\Box^n \mathcal{R}^q$, reflected by conical or solid angle defects. This motivates that gravitational models beyond general relativity need to be considered. These connections between regularity (= UV properties of field theories) and topological invariants (= IR observables) may hence present an intriguing avenue to search for traces of new physics and identify promising modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Holographic bounce cosmological models induced by viscous dark fluid from a generalized non-singular entropy function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bounce cosmological models containing a dark viscous fluid in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe are considered. The universe evolution is described in terms of generalized equation of state (EoS) parameters, in presence of the bulk viscosity. Entropic cosmology plays a key role in the discussion, and the matter bounce behavior is described based on a non-singular, generalized entropy function, recently proposed by Odintsov and Paul. Three different forms for the scale factor are investigated: an exponential, a power-law, and a double-exponential function, respectively. Appropriate bounce cosmological models are formulated, via the relevant parameters of the modified EoS, and analytical expressions for the corresponding infrared cut-off are obtained, via the particle horizon. Results are displayed in holographic form, making use of generalized holographic cut-offs first introduced by Nojiri and Odintsov. In addition, the viability of the corresponding bounce cosmological models is investigated, taking into account the actual thermodynamic properties of our universe, by means of a no-singular, generalized entropy function. In the asymptotic case, an expression for the generalized entropy is obtained, which remarkably has the additivity property.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Quantum Information from Unequal-Time QFT Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper continues on the program of developing a relativistic quantum information theory in terms of unequal-time correlation functions in quantum field theory (QFT)[arXiv:2208.03696]. Here, we focus on the definition of quantum resources from the irreducibly quantum behavior contained in the correlation functions of a QFT. We explain how set-ups with $N$ particle detectors probe the information in the high order field correlation functions. Our main object is the associated hierarchy of probability densities of $N$-detector events. We show that classical probabilistic hierarchies are subject to two conditions: Kolmogorov additivity and measurement independence. QFT violates those conditions, and the degree of violation enables us to define novel quantum resources. We give specific examples in set-ups where the main observables are the times of particle detection events. The new resources capture instances of irreducibly quantum behavior differ from the quantum behavior encapsulated in Bell inequalities. An interesting byproduct of our analysis is a relativistic state reduction rule for particles detected through scattering.</description>

      <title>Glueball Axion-Like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark Yang-Mills sectors that confine to form stable composite states, known as glueballs, have been traditionally proposed as a potential explanation for cosmological Dark Matter (DM). Earlier studies have established viability of the lightest scalar glueball as a possible DM candidate. In this work, we explore a whole class of effective composite sectors in the confined Yang-Mills regime featuring an additional pseudoscalar glueball state. We also investigate the role of effective interactions of the dark glueball sector with the visible sectors via higher-dimensional operators primarily focusing on dimension-8 couplings of glueballs to photons and gluons. We stress the remarkable similarities between the phenomenology of such glueball effective theories and Standard Model extensions featuring Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). Hence, one deals with a new class of composite Glueball ALPs (or GALPs) coupled to photons and/or nucleons in a wide mass range, from sub-eV to the Planck scale, yielding viable DM candidates that can be probed by astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Fix three dimensional geometries from entanglement entropies of CFT$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.01355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to fix the leading behaviors of three dimensional geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies. We only employ the holographic principle and do not use any assumption about the AdS/CFT correspondence and bulk geometry. Our strategy is to use both UV and IR-like CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies to fix the bulk geodesics. By a simple trick, then the metric can be extracted from the geodesics. As examples, we fix the leading behaviors of the pure AdS$_3$ metric from the entanglement entropies of free CFT$_2$, and more importantly the BTZ black hole from the entanglement entropies of finite temperature CFT$_2$. Consequently, CFT$_2$ with finite size or topological defects can be worked out by simple transformations. Following the same steps, in principle, it is possible to fix the leading behaviors of all three dimensional (topologically distinct) holographic classical geometries from the dual CFT$_2$ entanglement entropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.03522v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a $(3{+}1)$-dimensional covariant quantum space-time describing a FLRW cosmology with Big Bounce, obtained by a projection of the fuzzy hyperboloid $H^4_n$. This provides a background solution of the IKKT matrix model with mass term. We characterize the bosonic fluctuation spectrum, which consists of a tower of higher-spin modes. The modes are organized in terms of an underlying $SO(4,2)$ structure group, which is broken to the $SO(3,1)$ isometry of the background. The resulting higher-spin gauge theory includes all degrees of freedom required for gravity, and should be well suited for quantization. All modes propagate with the same speed of light, even though local boost invariance is not manifest. The propagating metric perturbation modes comprise those of a massless graviton, as well as a scalar mode. Gauge invariance allows to obtain the analog of the linearized Einstein-Hilbert action, which is expected to be induced upon quantization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.06876v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study ring of functions on the (classical and quantized) phase space of 2-dimensional BF theory with the gauge group $\mathrm{GL}_N$ coupled to a 1-dimensional quantum mechanics with global symmetry $\mathrm{GL}_K$. These functions are gauge-invariant local observables of the coupled system. We first construct the classical phase space of this system and describe its ring of functions and their large-$N$ limit. We next compute the Hilbert series of these algebras for finite-$N$ and also in the large-$N$ limit. We then study the quantization of this phase space and the deformation quantization of its ring of functions, elaborate its relation to the Yangian, and construct its coproduct. Finally, we identify these quantized algebras with the quantized Coulomb branch algebras of certain 3-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ quiver gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Restoration of residual gauge symmetries due to topological defects towards color confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14008v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the restoration of the residual gauge symmetry due to topological effects as a possible criterion for color confinement. Although the residual gauge symmetry is ``spontaneously broken'' in the perturbative vacuum, it must be restored in the true confining vacuum of QCD, provided that color confinement phase is a disordered phase where all of symmetries are unbroken. Therefore, the disappearance of the massless Nambu-Goldstone pole associated with this spontaneously breaking can be regarded as a criterion for color confinement. In the Lorenz gauge, indeed, the restoration condition was shown to agree with the Kugo-Ojima color confinement criterion at least for a special choice of the residual gauge transformation. In the previous paper, we have proposed to generalize this idea by including the topological defects. In this paper, we elaborate this scenario and obtain the criterion (i) by examining a finite large gauge transformation to properly take into account the topological effects, and (ii) by obtaining the condition for restricting the possible topological configurations so that they give a finite Euclidean action to give a non-vanishing contribution to the path integral.</description>

      <title>Double Copy from Tensor Products of Metric BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field theories with kinematic Lie algebras, such as field theories featuring colour-kinematics duality, possess an underlying algebraic structure known as BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebra. If, additionally, matter fields are present, this structure is supplemented by a module for the BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebra. We explain this perspective, expanding on our previous work and providing many additional mathematical details. We also show how the tensor product of two metric BV${}^{\color{gray} \blacksquare}$-algebras yields the action of a new syngamy field theory, a construction which comprises the familiar double copy construction. As examples, we discuss various scalar field theories, Chern-Simons theory, self-dual Yang-Mills theory, and the pure spinor formulations of both M2-brane models and supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. The latter leads to a new cubic pure spinor action for ten-dimensional supergravity. We also give a homotopy-algebraic perspective on colour-flavour-stripping, obtain a new restricted tensor product over a wide class of bialgebras, and we show that any field theory (even one without colour-kinematics duality) comes with a kinematic $L_\infty$-algebra.</description>

Abstract: We apply machine learning to understand fundamental aspects of holographic duality, specifically the entropies obtained from the apparent and event horizon areas. We show that simple features of only the time series of the pressure anisotropy, namely the values and half-widths of the maxima and minima, the times these are attained, and the times of the first zeroes can predict the areas of the apparent and event horizons in the dual bulk geometry at all times with a fixed maximum length (10) of the input vector. Given that simple Vaidya-type metrics constructed just from the apparent and event horizon areas can be used to approximately obtain unequal time correlation functions, we argue that the corresponding entropy functions are the measures of information that need to be extracted from simple one-point functions to reconstruct specific aspects of correlation functions of the dual state with the best possible approximations.</description>

      <title>Bubble velocities and oscillon precursors in first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastable `false' vacuum states are an important feature of the Standard Model of particle physics and many theories beyond it. Describing the dynamics of a phase transition out of a false vacuum via the nucleation of bubbles is essential for understanding the cosmology of vacuum decay and the full spectrum of observables. In this paper, we study vacuum decay by numerically evolving ensembles of field theories in 1+1 dimensions from a metastable state. We demonstrate that for an initial Bose-Einstein distribution of fluctuations, bubbles form with a Gaussian spread of center-of-mass velocities and that bubble nucleation events are preceded by an oscillon -- a long-lived, time-dependent, pseudo-stable configuration of the field. Defining an effective temperature from the long-wavelength amplitude of fluctuations in the ensemble of simulations, we find good agreement between theoretical finite temperature predictions and empirical measurements of the decay rate, velocity distribution and critical bubble solution. We comment on the generalization of our results and the implications for cosmological observables.</description>

Abstract: This work presents the application of the q-algebra in the glueballs spectrum. This algebra is implemented through Jackson derivatives in a Schr\"odinger-like equation resulting from the gravity fluctuations around the braneworld scenario in five dimensions. In our prescription, we consider a four-dimensional AdS$4$ brane, living in AdS$5$ bulk, that is also known for describing locally localized gravity via quasi-zero mode. At the appropriate limit, this background leads to confinement and allows us to find the shape of the $q$-deformed glueball spectrum in the AdS$5$/QCD$4$ correspondence. The introduction of the $q$-deformation provides us with a richer glueball spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a consistent set of boundary conditions for gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime at spacelike infinity, which yields an enhancement of the Bondi-Metzner Sachs group with smooth superrotations and new subleading symmetries. These boundary conditions are obtained by allowing fluctuations of the boundary structure which are responsible for divergences in the symplectic form, and a renormalization procedure is required to obtain finite canonical generators. The latter are then made integrable by incorporating boundary terms into the symplectic structure, which naturally derive from a linearized spin-two boundary field on a curved background with positive cosmological constant. Finally, we show that the canonical generators form a nonlinear algebra under the Poisson bracket and verify the consistency of this structure with the Jacobi identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13187v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Casimir effect of a rough membrane within the framework of theories that break Lorentz symmetry. We consider two constant Aether vectors: one timelike and other spacelike, simultaneously. We employ an appropriate change of coordinates such that the membrane assumes a completely flat border and the remaining terms associated with the roughness are considered as part of the potential. Quantum fluctuations are induced by a scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. The spectrum is obtained through perturbation theory and regularized using the $\zeta$--function method. We provide an explicit example of a membrane with periodic boundaries. The presence of Aether vectors has a significant impact on the dominant term of the Casimir effect, while roughness only affects the secondary terms. Additionally, we examine the finite-temperature case.</description>

Abstract: Double copy relates scattering amplitudes in a web of gravitational and gauge theories. Although it has seen great success when applied to amplitudes in vacuum, far less is known about double copy in arbitrary gravitational and gauge backgrounds. Focussing on the simplest pair production amplitudes of scalar QCD in a background gauge field, we construct, at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory, a double copy map to particle production in general metrics (and associated axio-dilatons) constructed from the gauge background. We connect our results to convolutional and classical double copy and, turning to examples, identify a class of gauge fields which generate FRW spacetimes via double copy. For this case we are able to conjecture the all-orders form of the double copy map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we construct CFT states describing a putative holographic dual to local excitations in the three-dimensional de Sitter space (dS), called the bulk local states. We find that the conjugation operation in dS$_3/$CFT$_2$ is notably different from that in AdS$_3/$CFT$_2$. This requires us to combine two bulk local states constructed out of different primary states in a CPT-invariant way. This analysis explains why Green's functions in the dS Euclidean vacuum cannot simply be obtained from the Wick rotation of those in AdS. We also argue that this characteristic feature explains the emergence of a time coordinate from the dual Euclidean CFT. We show that the information metric for the quantum estimation of bulk coordinate values replicates the de Sitter space metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the massive states in F-theory compactification models, including BPS string junctions stretching between parallel 7-branes and KK modes. We obtain analytical results when there are two colliding bunches of 7-branes with a locally constant axiodilaton profile. In particular, in 8D F-theory setups when the 7-branes collide into a codimension-one $(4,6,12)$ singularity, we found an infinite light tower of BPS string junctions, which should match the light KK tower in the dual heterotic description. To exactly match with the results in the distance conjecture, we propose that the definition of 8D Planck mass should receive a large correction. We have also computed parts of KK modes in 8D F-theory in a simplified setup, as well as the BPS string junction spectrum in specific setups of 6D and 4D F-theory.</description>

      <title>The surprising structure of non-relativistic 11-dimensional supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a non-relativistic limit of 11-dimensional supergravity. This limit leads to a theory with an underlying membrane Newton-Cartan geometry. Consistency of the non-relativistic limit requires the imposition of constraints, requiring that certain bosonic and fermionic torsions and curvatures vanish. We investigate the implications of two versions of these constraints. In one version, we keep only 16 supersymmetry transformations, leading to a simple (purely bosonic) constraint structure but an unusual realisation of the supersymmetry algebra which does not close into diffeomorphisms. In the other, we keep all 32 supersymmetry transformations. This requires a complicated sequence of bosonic and fermionic constraints, eventually involving three derivatives of bosonic fields. We argue, with a linearised calculation, that this sequence of constraints terminates. Furthermore, we show that there exists a family of supersymmetric solutions satisfying these constraints, containing the non-relativistic limit of the M2 supergravity solution recently obtained by Lambert and Smith as a background relevant for non-relativistic holography.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative topological string theory on compact Calabi-Yau manifolds from M-theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the full non-perturbative topological string free energy, in the holomorphic limit, follows simply from a target space integrating out calculation of M2 states. Qualitatively, this is the same as the calculation performed by Gopakumar and Vafa, but we find that the final expression must be modified due to a subtlety with poles induced by non-perturbative physics. Accounting for this modification leads to a Gopakumar-Vafa-like formula, which we propose as the exact formulation of the integrating out procedure. Evaluating the formula necessarily requires a contour integral in a complexified Schwinger proper time parameter. We show that this evaluation yields the full non-perturbative topological string free energy, and can be applied to a compact, or non-compact, Calabi-Yau threefold. The explicit formula presented holds as long as the two-cycles wrapped by the branes are rigid and smooth, but the methodology can be used to study also more general Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in Liouville Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liouville conformal field theory is a prototypical example of an exactly solvable quantum field theory, in the sense that the correlation functions in an arbitrary background can be determined exactly using only the constraints of unitarity and crossing symmetry. For example, the three point correlation functions are given by the famous formula of Dorn-Otto-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (DOZZ). Unlike many other exactly solvable theories, Liouville theory has a continuously tunable parameter -- essentially $\hbar$ -- which is related to the central charge of the theory. Here we investigate the nature of the perturbative expansion in powers of $\hbar$, which is the loop expansion around a semi-classical solution. We show that the perturbative coefficients grow factorially, as expected of a Feynman diagram expansion, and take the form of an asymptotic series. We identify the singularities in the Borel plane, and show that they are associated with complex instanton solutions of Liouville theory; they correspond precisely to the complex solutions described by Harlow, Maltz, and Witten. Both single- and multi-valued solutions of Liouville appear. We show that the perturbative loop expansions around these different saddle points mix in the way expected for a trans-series expansion. Thus Liouville theory provides a calculable example of a quantum field theory where perturbative and instanton contributions can be summed up and assembled into a finite answer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Miura operators for $W$- and $Y$-algebras from first principles as the expectation value of the intersection between a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. The expectation value, viewed as the transition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the representations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the operator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as conditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate the expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When the line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation value precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.</description>

      <title>Extremal rotating BTZ black holes cannot be dressed in (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16056v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the (anti-)self-dual condition for orthonormal components of the Faraday tensor, the 3D Einstein-Maxwell system with a negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$ admits a solution obtained by Kamata and Koikawa and later by Cataldo and Salgado in the most general form. Actually, Clement first obtained this solution and interpreted it as a regular particle-like solution without horizon. Nevertheless, it has been erroneously stated in some literature that this Clement-Cataldo-Salgado (CCS) solution, locally characterized by a single parameter, describes a black hole even in the charged case as it reduces to the extremal rotating Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) solution in the vacuum limit and its curvature invariants are constant. In this paper, we supplement Clement's interpretation by showing that there appears a parallelly propagated curvature singularity corresponding to an infinite affine parameter along spacelike geodesics at the location of the Killing horizon in the extremal rotating BTZ solution when the (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field is added. If the spatial coordinate $\theta$ is periodic, closed timelike curves exist near the singularity. It is also shown that the CCS solution is of the Cotton type N (in contrast to charged rotating BTZ black holes which are of type I away from the horizon), and the energy-momentum tensor of the Maxwell field is of the Hawking-Ellis type II. The metric solves the Einstein-$\Lambda$ equations also with a massless scalar field or a null dust fluid. We demonstrate that it belongs to the Kundt shear-free, non-twisting, non-expanding class of geometries, whereas extremal rotating BTZ black holes have expanding principal null directions. It means that the CCS metric represents the specific null ("radiative") Maxwell field generated by a singular source, rather than an extremal rotating BTZ black hole dressed in an (anti-)self-dual Maxwell field.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the influence of the electric charge of Reissner-Nordstrom black hole on the dynamics of fine-grained entropy of Hawking radiation, collected in finite entangling regions. We demonstrate that for certain sizes of finite regions, it is always possible to choose a value of the charge such that no information paradox formulated for finite entangling regions arises. For the sake of completeness, we explore how entanglement islands influence the described picture. We find that at small values of the electric charge, there is a discontinuity in the entropy due to the disappearance of the island, and with increasing charge the island ceases to ever dominate throughout entire evolution.</description>

Abstract: We study the defect CFT associated with the half-BPS Wilson line in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. Using a perturbative bootstrap approach, we derive new analytical results for multipoint correlators of protected defect operators at large $N$ and weak coupling. At next-to-next-to-leading order, we demonstrate that the simplest five- and six-point functions are fully determined by non-perturbative constraints -- which include superconformal symmetry, crossing symmetry, and the pinching of operators to lower-point functions -- as well as by a single integral, known as the train track integral.

      <title>Perturbative bootstrap of the Wilson-line defect CFT: Bulk-defect-defect correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the correlators of bulk and defect half-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with a Maldacena-Wilson line defect, focusing on the case involving one bulk and two defect local operators. We analyze the non-perturbative constraints on these correlators, which include a topological sector, pinching and splitting limits, as well as a compatibility with expanding in superconformal blocks. Using these constraints, we compute a variety of bulk-defect-defect correlators up to next-to-leading order at weak coupling, and observe that transcendental terms cancel. Additionally, we study the two leading terms in the strong-coupling regime, and present partial results for the next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors I: Potentials with degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the exact-WKB (EWKB) method through the analysis of Airy and Weber types, with an emphasis on the exact quantization of locally harmonic potentials in multiple sectors. The core innovation of our work lies in introducing a novel complexification approach to the energy parameter $u$, distinct from the common complexification of the (semi-classical) expansion parameter used in Borel summability. This new technique allows for continuous analytical continuation across different sectors of a potential while maintaining the exact quantization condition, even before median summation. By redefining the $A$-cycle above the potential barrier top, we ensure the quantization condition remains real and, by use of the Stokes automorphism and the median resummation, show that the resurgence structure is preserved across transitions between sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the Weber-type exact-WKB method, offering exact estimates for quantum actions around all types of saddle points, generalizing previous results. Through the analysis of these quantum actions, we reveal the presence of $S$-duality, facilitating the exchange between perturbative and non-perturbative behaviors, and we conjecture the mapping of the P-NP relations between dual theories. Our study encompasses periodic and symmetric double-well potentials, demonstrating that the exact-WKB method captures intricate structures in quantum systems in all sectors, including multi-instanton contributions and the resurgence of quantum actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We remind the definition and main properties of the Krichever quasiclassical tau-function, and turn to the application of these formulas for recent studies of two-dimensional quantum gravity. We show, that in the case of minimal gravity it turns to be directly related with the Verlinde formula for minimal models, giving in particular case its one more direct proof. Generalizations for continuous "complex Liouville" theory are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>On brane systems with O${}^+$ planes -- 5d and 6d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Higgs branches of field theories with 8 supercharges in 5 and 6 dimensions, focusing on theories realised on 5-brane webs in Type IIB with an O$7^+$ plane, or a D6-D8-NS5 brane system in Type IIA in the presence of an O$8^+$ plane. We find magnetic quivers for the Higgs branches of these theories. The main consequence of the presence of the orientifold is that it renders the magnetic quiver to be non-simply-laced. We propose a contribution of the O$7^+$ to the usual stable intersection number of 5-branes from tropical geometry, and show that it is consistent with Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations of magnetic quivers which represent mass deformations of 5d SQFTs. From the magnetic quivers, we compute phase diagrams and highest weight generating functions for the Higgs branches, enabling us to identify the global form of the flavour symmetry for several families of 5d SQFTs; among them Bhardwaj's rank-1 theory. For 6d theories realised on a $-4$ curve, we observe the appearance of an additional $D_4$ slice on top of the phase diagram as one goes to the tensionless limit.</description>

      <title>CPT Symmetry and its Breaking in the Chiral Fermion Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a revision of the discrete symmetries (C, P, T, CP, and CPT), within an approach that treats 2-component Weyl spinors as the fundamental building blocks. Then, we discuss some salient aspects of the discrete symmetries within quantum field theory (QFT). Besides the generic discussion, we also consider aspects arising within specific renormalizable theories (such as QED and YM). As a new application of the chiral formulation, we discuss the discrete symmetries for the Rarita-Schwinger (RS) spin-$\frac{3}{2}$ field. For the sake of completeness, the elements of linearized gravity (LG) and RS theories are discussed, as they are fundamental to Supergravity (SUGRA). We also discuss the advantages of using the 2-component spinors as the basic building blocks for the formulation of CPT-violating QFTs. Following this formalism, we establish an extension of the general RS theory with terms that violate the Lorentz symmetry and/or CPT symmetry, as well as the one already established in LG.</description>

      <title>First order corrections to black hole thermodynamics: a simple approach enhanced</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of higher derivative terms in the gravitational action brings about corrections to the original forms of black hole solutions and thermodynamics. A simple and valuable approach has emerged over two decades ago, which states that the first order corrections to black hole thermodynamics, caused by higher derivative terms, can be achieved without explicitly solving the perturbed metric. However, a direct application of this approach may potentially yield incorrect answers as it comes to AdS black holes, which poses a challenge to the valuable approach. In this paper, we identify the subtlety associated with AdS black holes is that certain higher derivative terms may alter the asymptotic structure of the spacetime. By taking this subtlety into account, we successfully enhance the original approach and resolve the mentioned problem. Furthermore, we make an interesting observation that the extremalization analysis that underlies this approach also plays a fundamental role in the perturbation theories of quantum mechanics and other disciplines.</description>

      <title>Spin-bounded correlations: rotation boxes within and beyond quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can detector click probabilities respond to spatial rotations around a fixed axis, in any possible physical theory? Here, we give a thorough mathematical analysis of this question in terms of "rotation boxes", which are analogous to the well-known notion of non-local boxes. We prove that quantum theory admits the most general rotational correlations for spins 0, 1/2, and 1, but we describe a metrological game where beyond-quantum resources of spin 3/2 outperform all quantum resources of the same spin. We prove a multitude of fundamental results about these correlations, including an exact convex characterization of the spin-1 correlations, a Tsirelson-type inequality for spins 3/2 and higher, and a proof that the general spin-J correlations provide an efficient outer SDP approximation to the quantum set. Furthermore, we review and consolidate earlier results that hint at a wealth of applications of this formalism: a theory-agnostic semi-device-independent randomness generator, an exact characterization of the quantum (2,2,2)-Bell correlations in terms of local symmetries, and the derivation of multipartite Bell witnesses. Our results illuminate the foundational question of how space constrains the structure of quantum theory, they build a bridge between semi-device-independent quantum information and spacetime physics, and they demonstrate interesting relations to topics such as entanglement witnesses, spectrahedra, and orbitopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late $80$-ties and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. In the present article we investigate the possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the $5$-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. The variational principle is formulated in $5$ dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations is then presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Weak equivalence principle and nonrelativistic limit of general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weak equivalence principle in the context of modified dispersion relations, a prevalent approach to quantum gravity phenomenology. We find that generic modified dispersion relations violate the weak equivalence principle. The acceleration in general depends on the mass of the test body, unless the Hamiltonian is either two-homogeneous in the test particles' 4-momenta or the corresponding Lagrangian differs from the homogeneous case by a total derivative only. The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation. Additionally, we apply a perturbative expansion in the test particle's spatial velocity and the inverse speed of light. To quantify our result, we provide a general formula for the E\"otv\'os factor of modified dispersion relations. As a specific example, we study the point-particle motion determined from the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e dispersion relation in the bicrossproduct basis. Comparing the ensuing non-vanishing E\"otv\'os factor to recent data from the MICROSCOPE experiment, we obtain a bound of the model parameter $\hat{\Xi} {}^{-1}\geq10^{15}{\rm GeV}/c^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two simple criteria for when a physical theory should be said to be "generally covariant", and we argue that these criteria are not met by Yang-Mills theory, even on geometric formulations of that theory. The reason, we show, is that the bundles encountered in Yang-Mills theory are not natural bundles; instead, they are gauge-natural. We then show how these observations relate to previous arguments about the significance of solder forms in assessing disanalogies between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. We conclude by suggesting that general covariance is really about functoriality.</description>

Abstract: Employing the modified Villain lattice formulation of the axion quantum electrodynamics, we present an alternative and much simpler derivation of the conclusion of~Ref.~\cite{Honda:2024sdz} that the sweep of the axial $U(1)$ non-invertible symmetry operator over the (non-genuine) gauge invariant 't~Hooft line operator with an integer magnetic charge does not leave any effect. The point is that such a 't~Hooft line can be represented by a boundary of a (non-topological) defect that is invariant under the axial transformation on the axion field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate potential scattering and tunneling dynamics of a particle wavepacket evolving according to the relativistic Schr\"odinger equation (also known as the Salpeter equation). The tunneling properties of the Salpeter equation differ from those of the standard relativistic wave equations (such as the Klein-Gordon or Dirac equations). In particular, the tunneling solutions must be found by working in momentum space, given that the equation in configuration space contains a pseudo-differential operator. The resulting integral equations are derived and solved numerically for wavepackets scattering on model potential barriers. The solutions are characterized by the absence of Klein tunneling and an effect of the potential on the fraction of the transmitted wavepacket that propagates outside the light cone, a feature that has in the past been well-studied only for free propagation.</description>

      <title>Linear response in planar Hall and thermal Hall setups for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall setups, where we subject a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl (RSW) semimetal to the combined influence of an electric field $\mathbf E $ (and/or temperature gradient $\nabla_{\mathbf r } T$) and a weak (i.e., non-quantizing) magnetic field $\mathbf B $. For computing the in-plane transport components, we have added an elastic deformation which gives rise to a chirality-dependent effective magnetic field $ \mathbf B^{\text{tot}} = \mathbf B + \chi \, \mathbf B_5 $, where $\chi $ is the chirality of an RSW node. We have included the effects of orbital magnetic moment (OMM), in conjunction with the Berry curvature (BC), both of which appear as a consequence of nontrivial topology of the bandstructure. Due to the presence of four bands, RSW semimetals provide a richer structure for obtaining the linear-response coefficients, compared to the Weyl semimetals. In particular, we have found that the OMM-contributed terms may oppose or add up to the BC-only parts, depending on which band we are considering. Last, but not the least, we have determined the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, whose nature corroborates the findings of some recent experimental results.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and Type Ia supernovae data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our non-parametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Rotating Quantum-Corrected Black Holes: Insights and Constraints from EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit using the rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) with an additional parameter $\alpha$ besides mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. We discover a decrease in the deflection angle $\alpha_D$, the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, and the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent images, $r_{mag}$, decreases rapidly as $\alpha$ increases. We compare RQCBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the quantum-corrected parameter $\alpha$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(14.8-26.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(11.12-19.78)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) SgrA* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.033-0.79)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.033-0.59)~\mu as$ for M87*. The deviations of the lensing observables $|\Delta\theta_\infty|$ and $|\Delta s|$ for RQCBH ($a=0.8,\alpha=0.4$) from Kerr black holes can reach up to $1.6~\mu as$ and $0.41~\mu as$ for Sgr A*, and $1.2~\mu as$ and $0.31~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\in~(1.81-6.82)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the 22 SMBHs at the center of various galaxies. We found that RQCBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Interestingly, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach approximately 24.95 min and 308.15 hrs, respectively. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5\%$-$10\% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We find a simple universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Translating current ALP photon coupling strength bounds to the Randall-Sundrum model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>
