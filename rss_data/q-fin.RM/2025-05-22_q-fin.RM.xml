      <title>Measuring risk contagion in financial networks with CoVaR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of a complex financial system may be assessed by measuring risk contagion between various financial institutions with relatively high exposure. We consider a financial network model using a bipartite graph of financial institutions (e.g., banks, investment companies, insurance firms) on one side and financial assets on the other. Following empirical evidence, returns from such risky assets are modeled by heavy-tailed distributions, whereas their joint dependence is characterized by copula models exhibiting a variety of tail dependence behavior. We consider CoVaR, a popular measure of risk contagion and study its asymptotic behavior under broad model assumptions. We further propose the Extreme CoVaR Index (ECI) for capturing the strength of risk contagion between risk entities in such networks, which is particularly useful for models exhibiting asymptotic independence. The results are illustrated by providing precise expressions of CoVaR and ECI when the dependence of the assets is modeled using two well-known multivariate dependence structures: the Gaussian copula and the Marshall-Olkin copula.</description>

      <title>Impact of Climate transition on Credit portfolio's loss with stochastic collateral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this work is to propose an end-by-end modeling framework to evaluate the risk measures of a bank's portfolio of collateralized loans in an economy subject to the climate transition. The economy, organized in sectors, is driven by a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) productivity process while the climate transition is declined thanks to continuous deterministic carbon price and intensities processes. We thus derive the dynamics of macroeconomic variables for each scenario. By considering that a firm defaults if it is over-indebted, we define each loan's loss at default as the difference between Exposure at Default (EAD) and the liquidated collateral, which will help us to define the Loss Given Default (LGD). We consider two types of collateral. First, if it is a financial asset (invoices, cash, or investments), we model the later by the continuous time version of the discounted cash flows methodology, where the cash flows growth is driven by the instantaneous output growth, the instantaneous growth of a carbon price function, and an arithmetic Brownian motion. Secondly, for physical asset (real estate, business equipment, or inventory), we focus on the example of a property in housing market. As in (Sopgoui 2024), a building price is the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential OU as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized future energy costs due to the inefficiency of the building, optimally determined by the carbon price process. Finally, we obtain expressions for risk measures of a portfolio of collateralized loans as a function of key climate transition parameters, such as carbon pricing and building energy efficiency. Banks will use these risk measures , depending on the climate transition scenarios, to define operating expenses, client fees, economic, and regulatory capital.</description>

      <title>QFNN-FFD: Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02595v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector. Implementing a dual-phase training model across distributed clients enhances data integrity and enables superior performance metrics, achieving precision rates consistently above 95%. Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</description>
