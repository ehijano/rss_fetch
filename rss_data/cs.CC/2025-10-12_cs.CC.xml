      <title>Psi-Turing Machines: Bounded Introspection for Complexity Barriers and Oracle Separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Psi-Turing Machines (Psi-TM): classical Turing machines equipped with a constant-depth introspection interface $ \iota $ and an explicit per-step information budget $ B(d,n)=c\,d\log_2 n $. With the interface frozen, we develop an information-theoretic lower-bound toolkit: Budget counting, $ \Psi $-Fooling, and $ \Psi $-Fano, with worked examples $ L_k $ and $ L_k^{\mathrm{phase}} $. We prove an oracle-relative separation $ P^{\Psi} \neq NP^{\Psi} $ and a strict depth hierarchy, reinforced by an Anti-Simulation Hook that rules out polynomial emulation of $ \iota_k $ using many calls to $ \iota_{k-1} $ under the budget regime. We also present two independent platforms (Psi-decision trees and interface-constrained circuits IC-AC$^{0}$/IC-NC$^{1}$) and bridges that transfer bounds among machine, tree, and circuit with explicit poly/log losses. The model preserves classical computational power outside $ \iota $ yet enables precise oracle-aware statements about barriers (relativization; partial/conditional progress on natural proofs and proof complexity). The aim is a standardized minimal introspection interface with clearly accounted information budgets.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$: A Non-Relativizing Proof via Quantale Weakness and Geometric Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a compositional, information-theoretic framework that turns short programs into locality on many independent blocks, and combine it with symmetry and sparsity of masked random Unique-SAT to obtain distributional lower bounds that contradict the self-reduction upper bound under $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. We work in the weakness quantale $w_Q=K_{\mathrm{poly}}(\cdot\mid\cdot)$. For an efficiently samplable ensemble $D_m$ made by masking random $3$-CNFs with fresh $S_m\ltimes(\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ symmetries and a small-seed Valiant--Vazirani isolation layer, we prove a Switching-by-Weakness normal form: for any polytime decoder $P$ of description length $\le \delta t$ (with $t=\Theta(m)$ blocks), a short wrapper $W$ makes $(P\circ W)$ per-bit local on a $\gamma$-fraction of blocks. Two ingredients then force near-randomness on $\Omega(t)$ blocks for every short decoder: (a) a sign-invariant neutrality lemma giving $\Pr[X_i=1\mid \mathcal{I}]=1/2$ for any sign-invariant view $\mathcal{I}$; and (b) a template sparsification theorem at logarithmic radius showing that any fixed local rule appears with probability $m^{-\Omega(1)}$. Combined with single-block bounds for tiny $\mathrm{ACC}^0$/streaming decoders, this yields a success bound $2^{-\Omega(t)}$ and, by Compression-from-Success, $K_{\mathrm{poly}}\big((X_1,\ldots,X_t)\mid(\Phi_1,\ldots,\Phi_t)\big)\ge \eta t$. If $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$, a uniform constant-length program maps any on-promise instance to its unique witness in polytime (bit fixing via a $\mathrm{USAT}$ decider), so $K_{\mathrm{poly}}(X\mid\Phi)\le O(1)$ and the tuple complexity is $O(1)$, contradicting the linear bound. The proof is non-relativizing and non-natural; symmetry, sparsification, and switching yield a quantale upper-lower clash, hence $\mathsf{P}\ne\mathsf{NP}$.</description>

      <title>A Faster Randomized Algorithm for Vertex Cover: An Automated Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces two techniques for the design and analysis of branching algorithms, illustrated through the case study of the Vertex Cover problem. First, we present a method for automatically generating branching rules through a systematic case analysis of local structures. Second, we develop a new technique for analyzing randomized branching algorithms using the Measure &amp; Conquer method, offering greater flexibility in formulating branching rules. By combining these innovations with additional techniques, we obtain the fastest known randomized algorithms in different parameters for the Vertex Cover problem on graphs with bounded degree (up to 6) and on general graphs. For example, our algorithm solves Vertex Cover on subcubic graphs in $O^*(1.07625^n)$ time and $O^*(1.13132^k)$ time, respectively. For graphs with maximum degree 4, we achieve running times of $O^*(1.13735^n)$ and $O^*(1.21103^k)$, while for general graphs we achieve $O^*(1.25281^k)$.</description>

      <title>A CSP approach to Graph Sandwich Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Sandwich Problem} (SP) for a graph class $\calC$ is the following computational problem. The input is a pair of graphs $(V,E_1)$ and $(V,E_2)$ where $E_1\subseteq E_2$, and the task is to decide whether there is an edge set $E$ where $E_1\subseteq E \subseteq E_2$ such that the graph $(V,E)$ belongs to $\calC$. In this paper we show that many SPs correspond to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of an infinite $2$-edge-coloured graph $H$. We then notice that several known complexity results for SPs also follow from general complexity classifications of infinite-domain CSPs, suggesting a fruitful application of the theory of CSPs to complexity classifications of SPs. We strengthen this evidence by using basic tools from constraint satisfaction theory to propose new complexity results of the SP for several graph classes including line graphs of multigraphs, line graphs of bipartite multigraphs, $K_k$-free perfect graphs, and classes described by forbidding finitely many induced subgraphs, such as $\{I_4,P_4\}$-free graphs, settling an open problem of Alvarado, Dantas, and Rautenbach (2019). We also construct a graph sandwich problem which is in coNP, but neither in P nor coNP-complete (unless P = coNP).</description>

      <title>Multiparty equality in the local broadcast model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiparty equality problem in graphs, where every vertex of a graph $G$ is given an input, and the goal of the vertices is to decide whether all inputs are equal. We study this problem in the local broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case.
  We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles, hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On Stable Cutsets in General and Minimum Degree Constrained Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stable cutset is a set of vertices $S$ of a connected graph, that is pairwise non-adjacent and when deleting $S$, the graph becomes disconnected. Determining the existence of a stable cutset in a graph is known to be NP-complete. In this paper, we introduce a new exact algorithm for Stable Cutset. By branching on graph configurations and using the $O^*(1.3645)$ algorithm for the (3,2)-Constraint Satisfaction Problem presented by Beigel and Eppstein, we achieve an improved running time of $O^*(1.2972^n)$.
  In addition, we investigate the Stable Cutset problem for graphs with a bound on the minimum degree $\delta$. First, we show that if the minimum degree of a graph $G$ is at least $\frac{2}{3}(n-1)$, then $G$ does not contain a stable cutset. Furthermore, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for graphs where $\delta \geq \tfrac{1}{2}n$, and a similar kernelisation algorithm for graphs where $\delta = \tfrac{1}{2}n - k$.
  Finally, we prove that Stable Cutset remains NP-complete for graphs with minimum degree $c$, where $c &gt; 1$. We design an exact algorithm for this problem that runs in $O^*(\lambda^n)$ time, where $\lambda$ is the positive root of $x^{\delta + 2} - x^{\delta + 1} + 6$. This algorithm can also be applied to the \textsc{3-Colouring} problem with the same minimum degree constraint, leading to an improved exact algorithm as well.</description>

      <title>Upper and Lower Bounds for the Linear Ordering Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Korten and Pitassi (FOCS, 2024) defined a new complexity class $L_2P$ as the polynomial-time Turing closure of the Linear Ordering Principle. They put it between $MA$ (Merlin--Arthur protocols) and $S_2P$ (the second symmetric level of the polynomial hierarchy).
  In this paper we sandwich $L_2P$ between $P^{prMA}$ and $P^{prSBP}$. (The oracles here are promise problems, and $SBP$ is the only known class between $MA$ and $AM$.) The containment in $P^{prSBP}$ is proved via an iterative process that uses a $prSBP$ oracle to estimate the average order rank of a subset and find the minimum of a linear order.
  Another containment result of this paper is $P^{prO_2P} \subseteq O_2P$ (where $O_2P$ is the input-oblivious version of $S_2P$). These containment results altogether have several byproducts:
  We give an affirmative answer to an open question posed by of Chakaravarthy and Roy (Computational Complexity, 2011) whether $P^{prMA} \subseteq S_2P$, thereby settling the relative standing of the existing (non-oblivious) Karp-Lipton-style collapse results of Chakaravarthy and Roy (2011) and Cai (2007),
  We give an affirmative answer to an open question of Korten and Pitassi whether a Karp-Lipton-style collapse can be proven for $L_2P$,
  We show that the Karp-Lipton-style collapse to $P^{prOMA}$ is actually better than both known collapses to $P^{prMA}$ due to Chakaravarthy and Roy (Computational Complexity, 2011) and to $O_2P$ also due to Chakaravarthy and Roy (STACS, 2006). Thus we resolve the controversy between previously incomparable Karp-Lipton collapses stemming from these two lines of research.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity Parameterized by Mim-Width is (Indeed) Para-NP-Hard</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Hamiltonian Path and Hamiltonian Cycle are NP-hard on graphs of linear mim-width 26, even when a linear order of the input graph with mim-width 26 is provided together with input. This fills a gap left by a broken proof of the para-NP-hardness of Hamiltonicity problems parameterized by mim-width.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Quantum Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing involving physical systems with continuous degrees of freedom, such as the quantum states of light, has recently attracted significant interest. However, a well-defined quantum complexity theory for these bosonic computations over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is missing. In this work, we lay foundations for such a research program. We introduce natural complexity classes and problems based on bosonic generalizations of BQP, the local Hamiltonian problem, and QMA. We uncover several relationships and subtle differences between standard Boolean classical and discrete variable quantum complexity classes and identify outstanding open problems. In particular:
  1. We show that the power of quadratic (Gaussian) quantum dynamics is equivalent to the class BQL. More generally, we define classes of continuous-variable quantum polynomial time computations with a bounded probability of error based on higher-degree gates. Due to the infinite dimensional Hilbert space, it is not a priori clear whether a decidable upper bound can be obtained for these classes. We identify complete problems for these classes and demonstrate a BQP lower and EXPSPACE upper bound. We further show that the problem of computing expectation values of polynomial bosonic observables is in PSPACE.
  2. We prove that the problem of deciding the boundedness of the spectrum of a bosonic Hamiltonian is co-NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that the problem of finding the minimum energy of a bosonic Hamiltonian critically depends on the non-Gaussian stellar rank of the family of energy-constrained states one optimizes over: for constant stellar rank, it is NP-complete; for polynomially-bounded rank, it is in QMA; for unbounded rank, it is undecidable.</description>
