      <title>A 500 pc volume-limited sample of hot subluminous stars I. Space density, scale height, and population properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first volume-limited sample of spectroscopically confirmed hot subluminous stars out to 500 pc, defined using the accurate parallax measurements from the {\em Gaia} space mission data release 3 (DR3). The sample comprises a total of 397 members, with 305 ($\sim 77\%$) identified as hot subdwarf stars, including 83 newly discovered systems. Of these, we observe that 178 ($\sim58\%$) are hydrogen-rich sdBs, 65 are sdOBs ($\sim 21\%$), 32 are sdOs ($\sim 11\%$), and 30 are He-sdO/Bs ($\sim 10\%$). Among them, 48 ($\sim 16\%$) exhibit an infrared excess in their spectral energy distribution fits, suggesting a composite binary system. The hot subdwarf population is estimated to be 90\% complete, assuming that most missing systems are these composite binaries located within the main sequence (MS) in the \emph{Gaia} colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). The remaining sources in the sample include cataclysmic variables (CVs), blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs), hot white dwarfs (WDs), and MS stars. We derived the mid-plane density $\rho_{0}$ and scale height $\mathrm{h}_{z}$ for the non-composite hot subdwarf star population using a hyperbolic sechant profile (sech$^2$). The best-fit values are $\rho_{0}\,=\,5.17\pm 0.33 \times10^{-7}$ stars/pc$^{3}$ and $\mathrm{h}_{z} = 281 \pm 62$ pc. When accounting for the composite-colour hot subdwarfs and their estimated completeness, the mid-plane density increases to $\rho_{0}\,=\,6.15^ {+1.16}_{-0.53} \times10^{-7}$ stars/pc$^{3}$. This corrected space density is an order of magnitude lower than predicted by population synthesis studies, supporting previous observational estimates.</description>

      <title>A coherent view of Li depletion and angular momentum transport to explain the Li plateau -- from Population II to Population I stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the cosmological Li problem - the discrepancy between Big Bang nucleosynthesis predictions and observed values in the Spite plateau - requires a comprehensive exploration of stellar evolution. In this study, we utilized the code STAREVOL to compute the stellar evolution models with atomic diffusion, rotation-induced processes, parametric turbulence, and additional viscosity. We calibrated the models to fit the abundance of Li in Population II stars selected from the GALAH DR3 spectroscopic survey and literature compilation based on their chemical composition. The calibration reveals the significance of parametric turbulence in counteracting atomic diffusion effects. These models predict the constancy of the Spite plateau as a function of $T_\mathrm{eff}$ and [Fe/H] which agrees with the observational trend found after a detailed selection of dwarf non-peculiar stars. Other dwarfs that lie below the Spite plateau are either CEMP or have other types of chemical peculiarities, reinforcing the notion of their environmental origin. The Li abundance near the Spite plateau of the most Fe-deficient star, J0023+0307, which is not CEMP, provides additional evidence for the stellar depletion solution of the Li cosmological problem. Also, our models predict a transition from Li constancy at low metallicities to dispersion at high metallicities which is seen in observations. In addition, we extend our analysis to include a comparison with observational data from the globular cluster NGC 6752, showcasing excellent agreement between model predictions and Li and Mg trends in post-turnoff stars. This opens avenues for refining the estimates of initial Li abundance in metal-rich globular clusters which would help to constrain Li evolution in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Mining the GALAH data I: Study of five Super lithium-rich metal-poor giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of a large amount of Li in giants is still a mystery. Most of the super Li-rich giants reported in recent studies are in the solar metallicity regime. Here, we study the five metal-poor super Li-rich giants (SLRs) from GALAH Data Release 3 with their [Fe/H] ranging from -1.35 to -2.38 with lithium abundance of A(Li) $\geq$ 3.4~dex. The asteroseismic analysis reveals that none are on the red giant branch. The average period spacing ($\Delta P$ ) values indicate giants are in the core He-burning phase. All of them are low-mass giants (M $&lt;$ 1.5M$_{\odot}$). The location in the HR diagram suggests one of them is in the red clump phase, and interestingly, the other four are much brighter and coincide with the early AGB phase. The abundance analysis reveals that C, O, Na, Ba, and Eu are normal for giants of respective metallicities and evolutionary phases. Further, we didn't find any strong evidence for the presence of dust in the form of infrared excess or binarity from the available radial velocity data. We discussed a few scenarios for the existence of SLRs at higher luminosity, including past merger events. The findings will help to understand the production and evolution of Li among giants, in particular, during and the post-red clump phase.</description>

      <title>An Observational View of Structure in Protostellar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The envelopes and disks that surround protostars reflect the initial conditions of star and planet formation and govern the assembly of stellar masses. Characterizing these structures requires observations that span the near-infrared to centimeter wavelengths. Consequently, the past two decades have seen progress driven by numerous advances in observational facilities across this spectrum, including the \textit{Spitzer Space Telescope}, \textit{Herschel Space Observatory}, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and a host of other ground-based interferometers and single-dish radio telescopes. Nearly all protostars appear to have well-formed circumstellar disks that are likely to be rotationally-supported; the ability to detect a disk around a protostar is more a question of spatial resolution than whether or not a disk is present. The disks around protostars have inherently higher millimeter/submillimeter luminosities as compared to disks around more-evolved pre-main sequence stars, though there may be systematic variations between star forming regions. The envelopes around protostars are inherently asymmetric and streamers emphasize that mass flow through the envelopes to the disks may not be homogeneous. The current mass distribution of protostars may be impacted by selection bias given that it is skewed toward solar-mass protostars, inconsistent with the stellar initial mass function.</description>

      <title>The First High-Contrast Images of Near High-Mass X-Ray Binaries with Keck/NIRC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the study of X-ray binaries has led to major breakthroughs in high-energy astrophysics, their circumbinary environment at scales of $\sim$100--10,000 astronomical units has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we undertake a novel and exploratory study by employing direct and high-contrast imaging techniques on a sample of X-ray binaries, using adaptive optics and the vortex coronagraph on Keck/NIRC2. High-contrast imaging opens up the possibility to search for exoplanets, brown dwarfs, circumbinary companion stars, and protoplanetary disks in these extreme systems. Here, we present the first near-infrared high-contrast images of 13 high-mass X-ray binaries located within $\sim$2--3 kpc. The key results of this campaign involve the discovery of several candidate circumbinary companions ranging from sub-stellar (brown dwarf) to stellar masses. By conducting an analysis based on galactic population models, we discriminate sources that are likely background/foreground stars and isolate those that have a high probability ($\gtrsim 60 - 99\%$) of being gravitationally bound to the X-ray binary. This publication seeks to establish a preliminary catalog for future analyses of proper motion and subsequent observations. With our preliminary results, we calculate the first estimate of the companion frequency and the multiplicity frequency for X-ray binaries: $\approx$0.6 and 1.8 $\pm$ 0.9 respectively, considering only the sources that are most likely bound to the X-ray binary. In addition to extending our comprehension of how brown dwarfs and stars can form and survive in such extreme systems, our study opens a new window to our understanding of the formation of X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Energy estimation of small-scale jets from the quiet-Sun region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Solar jets play a role in the coronal heating and the supply of solar wind. Aims. This study calculated the energies of 23 small-scale jets emerging from a quiet-Sun region to investigate their contributions for coronal heating. Conclusions. Our observations suggest that although these jets cannot provide sufficient energy for the heating of the whole quiet-Sun coronal region, they are likely to account for a significant portion of the energy demand in the local regions where the jets occur.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Resistivity on the Periodicity of Oscillatory Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillatory reconnection mechanism is investigated for a parameter study of eight orders of magnitude of resistivity, with a particular interest in the evolution of the oscillating current density at the null point and its associated periodicity. The resistive, nonlinear MHD simulations are solved in 2.5D for different levels of resistivity. Three methods (wavelet analysis, Fourier transform and ANOVA) are used to investigate the effect of resistivity versus resultant period. It is found that there is an independence between the level of background resistivity and the period of the oscillatory reconnection mechanism. Conversely, it is found that resistivity has a significant effect on the maximum amplitude of the current density and the nature of its decay rate, as well as the magnitude of ohmic heating at the null.</description>

      <title>Expanding the frontiers of cool-dwarf asteroseismology with ESPRESSO. Detection of solar-like oscillations in the K5 dwarf $\epsilon$ Indi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuelled by space photometry, asteroseismology is vastly benefitting the study of cool main-sequence stars, which exhibit convection-driven solar-like oscillations. Even so, the tiny oscillation amplitudes in K dwarfs continue to pose a challenge to space-based asteroseismology. A viable alternative is offered by the lower stellar noise over the oscillation timescales in Doppler observations. In this letter we present the definite detection of solar-like oscillations in the bright K5 dwarf $\epsilon$ Indi based on time-intensive observations collected with the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the VLT, thus making it the coolest seismic dwarf ever observed. We measured the frequencies of a total of 19 modes of degree $\ell=0$--2 along with $\nu_{\rm max}=5305\pm176\:{\rm \mu Hz}$ and $\Delta\nu=201.25\pm0.16\:{\rm \mu Hz}$. The peak amplitude of radial modes is $2.6\pm0.5\:{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$, or a mere ${\sim} 14\%$ of the solar value. Measured mode amplitudes are ${\sim} 2$ times lower than predicted from a nominal $L/M$ scaling relation and favour a scaling closer to $(L/M)^{1.5}$ below ${\sim} 5500\:{\rm K}$, carrying important implications for our understanding of the coupling efficiency between pulsations and near-surface convection in K dwarfs. This detection conclusively shows that precise asteroseismology of cool dwarfs is possible down to at least the mid-K regime using next-generation spectrographs on large-aperture telescopes, effectively opening up a new domain in observational asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetry of Fraunhofer lines in local upper solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetric results of Fraunhofer lines between 516.3nm and 532.6nm are presented in local upper solar chromosphere, transition zone and inner corona below a height of about 0.04 solar radius above the solar limb. The data were acquired on Nov.3, 2013 during a total solar eclipse in Gabon by the prototype Fiber Arrayed Solar Optical Telescope(FASOT). It is found that the polarization amplitudes of the Fraunhofer lines in these layers depend strongly on specific spectral lines. Fraunhofer line at MgI$b_{1}$518.4nm can have a polarization amplitude up to 0.36$\%$ with respective to the continuum polarization level, while the polarizations of some lines like FeI/CrI524.7nm and FeI525.0nm are often under the detection limit 6.0$\times 10^{-4}$. The polarizations of the Fraunhofer lines, like the emission lines and the continuum, increase with height as a whole trend. The fractional linear polarization amplitudes of inner F-corona can be close to those of inner E-corona, and in general larger than those of inner K-corona. Rotation of the polarization direction of Fraunhofer line is often accompanied with variations in their polarization amplitudes and profile shapes. It is also judged from these polarimetric properties, along with evidences, that neutral atoms exist in these atmospheric layers. Thus the inner F-corona described here is induced by the neutral atoms, and the entropy of the inner corona evaluated becomes larger than those in the underneath layers due to more microstates found.</description>

      <title>Six new eccentric eclipsing systems with a third body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of six new triple stellar system candidates composed of an inner eccentric-orbit eclipsing binary with an apsidal motion. These stars were studied using new, precise TESS light curves and a long-term collection of older photometric ground-based data. These data were used for the monitoring of ETVs (eclipse timing variations) and to detect the slow apsidal movements along with additional periodic signals. The systems analysed were ASASSN-V J012214.37+643943.3 (orbital period 2.01156 d, eccentricity 0.15, third body with 3.3 yr period); ASASSN-V J052227.78+345257.6 (2.42673 d, 0.35, 3.2 yr); ASASSN-V J203158.98+410731.4 (2.53109 d, 0.20, 2.7 yr); ASASSN-V J230945.10+605349.3 (2.08957 d, 0.18, 2.3 yr); ASASSN-V J231028.27+590841.8 (2.41767 d, 0.43, 4.9 yr); and NSV 14698 (3.30047 d, 0.147, 0.5 yr). In the system ASASSN-V J230945.10+605349.3, we detected a second eclipsing pair (per 2.99252 d) and found adequate ETV for the pair B, proving its 2+2 bound quadruple nature. All of these detected systems deserve special attention from long-term studies for their three-body dynamics since their outer orbital periods are not too long and because some dynamical effects should be detectable during the next decades. The system NSV 14698 especially seems to be the most interesting from the dynamical point of view due to it having the shortest outer period of the systems we studied, its fast apsidal motion, and its possible orbital changes during the whole 20th century.</description>

      <title>Modeling the secular evolution of embedded protoplanetary discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Protoplanetary discs are known to form around nascent stars from their parent molecular cloud as a result of angular momentum conservation. As they progressively evolve and dissipate, they also form planets. While a lot of modeling efforts have been dedicated to their formation, the question of their secular evolution, from the so-called class 0 embedded phase to the class II phase where discs are believed to be isolated, remains poorly understood. Aims: We aim to explore the evolution between the embedded stages and the class II stage. We focus on the magnetic field evolution and the long-term interaction between the disc and the envelope. Methods: We use the GPU-accelerated code \textsc{Idefix} to perform a 3D, barotropic, non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) secular core collapse simulation that covers the system evolution from the collapse of the pre-stellar core until 100 kyr after the first hydrostatic core formation and the disc settling while ensuring sufficient vertical and azimuthal resolutions (down to $10^{-2}$ au) to properly resolve the disc internal dynamics and non-axisymmetric perturbations. Results: The disc evolution leads to a power-law gas surface density in Keplerian rotation that extends up to a few 10 au. The magnetic flux trapped in the disc during the initial collapse decreases from 100 mG at disc formation down to 1 mG by the end of the simulation. After the formation of the first hydrostatic core, the system evolves in three phases. A first phase with a small ($\sim 10$ au), unstable, strongly accreting ($\sim10^{-5}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$) disc that loses magnetic flux over the first 15 kyr, a second phase where the magnetic flux is advected with a smooth, expanding disc fed by the angular momentum of the infalling material...</description>

      <title>On the Ambipolar Diffusion Formulation for Ion-neutral drifts in the non-negligible drift velocity limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambipolar diffusion approximation is used to model partially ionised plasma dynamics in a single fluid setting. To correctly apply the commonly used version of ambipolar diffusion, a set of criteria should be satisfied including the requirement that the difference in velocity between charges and neutral species (known as drift velocity) is much smaller than the thermal velocity, otherwise the drift velocity will drive a non-negligible level of further collisions between the two species. In this paper we explore the consequence of relaxing this assumption. We show that a new induction equation can be formulated without this assumption. This formulation reduces to the ambipolar induction equation in the case the drift velocity is small. In the large drift velocity limit, the feedback of the drift velocity on the collision frequency results in decreased diffusion of the magnetic field compared with the standard ambipolar diffusion approximation for the same parameters. This has a natural consequence of reducing the frictional heating that can occur. Applying this to results from flux emergence simulations where the expansion of the magnetic field leads to strong adiabatic cooling of the partially ionised chromosphere resulted in a noticeable reduction in the magnitude of the predicted drift velocities.</description>

      <title>The interacting double white dwarf population with LISA; stochastic foreground and resolved sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of tidal torques and mass transfer on the population of double white dwarfs (DWDs) that will be observed with LISA. Starting from a distribution of DWDs at formation predicted by numerical simulations, we use a semi-analytical model to evolve DWDs under different hypotheses for the efficiency of tidal coupling and the birth spins of white dwarfs. We then estimate the stochastic foreground and the population of resolvable binaries for LISA in each scenario. Our predicted DWD binary distribution can differ substantially from the distribution expected if only gravitational waves (GWs) are considered. If white dwarfs spin slowly, then we predict an excess of systems around a few mHz, due to binaries that outspiral after the onset of mass transfer. This excess of systems leads to differences in the confusion noise, which are most pronounced for strong tidal coupling. In that case, we find a significantly higher number of resolvable binaries than in the GW-only scenario. If instead white dwarfs spin rapidly and tidal coupling is weak, then we find no excess around a few mHz, and the confusion noise due to DWDs is very small. In that scenario, we also predict a subpopulation of outspiralling binaries below 0.1 mHz. Using the Fisher matrix approximation, we estimate the uncertainty on the GW-frequency derivative of resolvable systems. We estimate that, even for non-accreting systems, the mismodelling error due to neglect of effects other than GWs is larger than the statistical uncertainty, and thus this neglect would lead to biased estimates for mass and distance. Our results highlight the need for flexible tools in LISA data analysis. Because our semi-analytical model hinges upon a simplistic approach to determining the stability of mass accretion it will be important to deepen our comprehension of stability in mass-transferring DWD binaries.</description>

      <title>Permutation Entropy and Complexity Analysis of Large-scale Solar Wind Structures and Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a statistical study of magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind at 1 au using permutation entropy and complexity analysis, and the investigation of the temporal variations of the Hurst exponents. Slow and fast wind, magnetic clouds, interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME)-driven sheath regions and slow-fast stream interaction regions (SIRs) have been investigated separately. Our key finding is that there are significant differences in permutation entropy and complexity values between the solar wind types at larger timescales and little difference at small timescales. Differences become more distinct with increasing timescale, suggesting that smaller-scale turbulent features are more universal. At larger timescales, the analysis method can be used to identify localized spatial structures. We found that except in magnetic clouds, fluctuation are largely anti-persistent and that the Hurst exponents, in particular in compressive structures (sheaths and SIRs) exhibit a clear locality. Our results shows that, in all cases apart from magnetic clouds at largest scales, solar wind fluctuations are stochastic with the fast wind having the highest entropies and low complexities. Magnetic clouds in turn exhibit the lowest entropy and highest complexity, consistent with them being coherent structures in which the magnetic field components vary in an ordered manner. SIRs, slow wind and ICME sheaths are intermediate to magnetic clouds and fast wind, reflecting the increasingly ordered structure. Our results also indicate that permutation entropy - complexity analysis is a useful tool for characterizing the solar wind and investigating the nature of its fluctuations.</description>

      <title>CHIANTI -- an atomic database for emission lines -- Paper XVIII. Version 11, advanced ionization equilibrium models: density and charge transfer effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Version 11 of the CHIANTI database and software package is presented. Advanced ionization equilibrium models have been added for low charge states of seven elements (C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Si and S), and represent a significant improvement especially when modelling the solar transition region. The models include the effects of higher electron density and charge transfer on ionization and recombination rates. As an illustration of the difference these models make, a synthetic spectrum is calculated for an electron pressure of 7$\times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ K and compared with an active region observation from HRTS. Increases are seen of factors of two to five in the predicted radiances of the strongest lines in the UV from Si IV, C IV, and N V, compared to the previous modelling using the coronal approximation. Much better agreement (within 20\%) with the observation is found for the majority of the lines. The new atomic models better equip both those who are studying the transition region and those who are interpreting emission from higher density astrophysical and laboratory plasma. In addition to the advanced models, several ion datasets have been added or updated, and data for the radiative recombination energy loss rate have been updated.</description>

      <title>Some Findings from the Longitudinal Migration of Starspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results regarding the longitudinal migrations of cool stellar spots that exhibit remarkable oscillations and explore their possible causes. We conducted analyses using high-quality data from nine target systems of various spectral types, spanning from F to M, which were observed by the Kepler Satellite. The systems in which the behaviour of the spots was examined are as follows: KIC 4357272, KIC 6025466, KIC 6058875, KIC 6962018, KIC 7798259, KIC 9210828, KIC 11706658, KIC 12599700, and KIC 8669092. Basic stellar parameters were calculated from light curve analysis using the PHOEBE V.0.32 software, and light curves were modelled to obtain sinusoidal variations occurring out-of-eclipses phases, induced by rotational modulation. Subsequently, we calculated the minimum times of the obtained sinusoidal variations using the Fourier transform. The distributions of {\theta}min corresponding to these minimum times over time were computed using linear fits to determine the longitudinal migrations of the spotted areas. We then compared the longitudinal migration periods with the stellar parameters found in the literature. In addition, we also found a secondary variation in the spot migrations apart from the linear models. Our results revealed that the longitudinal migration periods vary in relation to the B - V colour index of the stars.</description>

      <title>High-cadence monitoring of the emission properties of magnetar XTE J1810-197 with the Stockert radio telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [...] We present a singlepulse search method, improving on commonly used neural network classifiers thanks to the filtering of radio frequency interference based on its spectral variance and the magnetar's rotation. With this approach, we were able to lower the signal to noise ratio (S/N) detection threshold from 8 to 5. This allowed us to find over 115,000 spiky single pulses - compared to 56,000 from the neutral network approach. Here, we present the temporal variation of the overall profile and single pulses. Two distinct phases of different single pulse activity can be identified: phase 1 from December 2018 to mid-2019, with a few single pulses per hour, and phase 2 from September 2020 with hundreds of single pulses per hour (with a comparable average flux density). We find that the single pulse properties and folded profile in phase 2 exhibit a change around mid-March 2021. Before this date, the folded profile consists of a single peak and single pulses, with fluences of up to 1000 Jyms and a single-peaked width distribution at around 10 ms. After mid-March 2021, the profile consists of a two peaks and the single pulse population shows a bimodal width distribution with a second peak at 1 ms and fluences of up to 500 Jyms. We also present asymmetries in the phase-resolved single pulse width distributions beginning to appear in 2020, where the pulses arriving earlier in the rotational phase appear wider than those appearing later. This asymmetry persists despite the temporal evolution of the other single pulse and emission properties. We argue that a drift in the emission region in the magnetosphere may explain this observed behaviour. Additionally, we find that the fluence of the detected single pulses depends on the rotational phase and the highest fluence is found in the centre of the peaks in the profile. [...]</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the optical light curves of two Be X-ray Binaries, IGR J06074+2205 and SAX J2103.5+4545 recovered from the ATLAS, ZTF and ASAS-SN databases. Both sources show long term optical variability of 620 and 420 days respectively, with color redder when brighter. We suggest that this is due to the precession of the circumstellar disk. Another possibility is the propagation of a density wave in the disk. We remark that only these two sources show a large amplitude, periodic optical variability out of a sample of 16 well studied High Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXB) with a Main Sequence primary star.</description>

      <title>Modeling Circumstellar Gas Emission around a White Dwarf Using Cloudy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemical composition of an extrasolar planet is fundamental to its formation, evolution and habitability. In this study, we explore a new way to measure the chemical composition of the building blocks of extrasolar planets, by measuring the gas composition of the disrupted planetesimals around white dwarf stars. As a first attempt, we used the photo-ionization code Cloudy to model the circumstellar gas emission around a white dwarf Gaia J0611$-$6931 under some simplified assumptions. We found most of the emission lines are saturated and the line ratios approaching the ratios of thermal emission; therefore only lower limits to the number density can be derived. Silicon is the best constrained element in the circumstellar gas and we derived a lower limit of 10$^{10.3}$ cm$^{-3}$. In addition, we placed a lower limit on the total amount of gas to be 1.8 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ g. Further study is needed to better constrain the parameters of the gas disk and connect it to other white dwarfs with circumstellar gas absorption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstandard interaction is expected to be a crucial hint to explain the experimental data of neutrino scattering off electrons. In this context, the nonstandard interaction vector and axial-vector couplings are needed to be extracted from recent experiments and a few of them are now available in the literature. With these coupling bounds, in this paper, I explore their impacts on the neutrinos interacting with the free electron gas in dense matter. To this end, I compute and predict the neutrino differential cross section and mean free path in dense matter for all those experimental bounds. Interesting behavior in the neutrino cross sections and mean free path is found for the different nonstandard interaction couplings from different experiment constraints. I also found that the neutrino cross-section and mean free path in the dense matter are very sensitive to values and signs of the nonstandard interaction couplings, leading to different prediction results to the Standard Model cross-section and mean free path.</description>

Abstract: The historical detection of gravitational waves from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 is providing fundamental new insights into the astrophysical site for the creation of the heaviest elements in the cosmos and on the equation of state of neutron-rich matter. Shortly after this historical detection, electromagnetic observations of neutron stars together with measurements of the properties of neutron-rich nuclei at terrestrial facilities have placed additional constraints on the dynamics of neutron-rich matter. It is this unique synergy between heaven and earth that is the focus of this article.</description>

      <title>Chandra and HST studies of the X-ray sources in the Globular Cluster NGC 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse a Chandra observation of the rich globular cluster NGC 362, finding 33 X-ray sources within 1' (1.2 half-mass radii) of the cluster center. Spectral analysis of the brightest source (X1) shows blackbody-like emission, indicating it is likely a quiescent low-mass X-ray binary; we find a possible counterpart that falls in the sub-subgiant region. We use HST UV Globular Cluster Survey (HUGS) photometry to identify 15 potential optical/UV counterparts to these X-ray sources, including two background AGN. We identify no likely CVs, probably due to crowding in optical filters in the core, though we predict of order 8 CVs among the detected X-ray sources. We identify three other sub-subgiants and two red straggler counterparts, which are likely powered by coronal activity, along with five other potential coronally active binary counterparts to three X-ray sources. Finally, we note two unusual counterpart candidates that lie to the red of the red giant branch in V_606 - I_814, and shift well to the blue of the red giant branch in ultraviolet colour-magnitude diagrams. These systems seem to contain a red giant with a distorted evolutionary history, plus a bright blue light source, either a blue straggler star (an Algol-like system) or an accreting white dwarf (a long-period CV, or a symbiotic star).</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harboring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, choked jets have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic signatures is crucial. A choked-jet source is expected harboring in core-collapse supernovae with extended hydrogen envelopes, leading to the release of ultraviolet and optical emission for a few days. The ultraviolet band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future mission satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the chocked source visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic and photohadronic interactions in choked jets, we also investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (as IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with electromagnetic signals coming from shock breakout events. By considering fiducial parameters of the source population and instruments performances, we estimate the maximum redshift up to which ULTRASAT and ZTF are able to detect ultraviolet and optical signals from these explosions, respectively. Furthermore, we discuss coordinated multi-messenger observations among those instruments and high-energy neutrino telescopes. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources enlarging the sample of observed Type II supernovae by around 60%. For optimized multi-messenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at the shock breakout occurrence (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a subsequent follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after.</description>

      <title>The APO-K2 Catalog. II. Accurate Stellar Ages for Red Giant Branch Stars Across the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present stellar age determinations for 4,661 red giant branch (RGB) stars in the APO-K2 Catalog, derived using mass estimates from K2 asteroseismology from the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program and elemental abundances from the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. Our sample includes 17 of the 19 fields observed by K2, making it one of the most comprehensive catalogs of accurate stellar ages across the Galaxy in terms of the wide range of populations spanned by its stars, enabling rigorous tests of Galactic chemical evolution models. Taking into account the selection functions of the K2 sample, the data appear to support the age-chemistry morphology of stellar populations predicted by both inside-out and late-burst scenarios. We also investigate trends in age versus stellar chemistry and Galactic position, which are consistent with previous findings. Comparisons against APOKASC-3 asteroseismic ages show agreement to within ~3%. We also discuss offsets between our ages and spectroscopic ages. Finally, we note that ignoring the effects of $\alpha$-enhancement on stellar opacity (either directly or with the Salaris metallicity correction) results in an ~10% offset in age estimates for the most $\alpha$-enhanced stars, which is an important consideration for continued tests of Galactic models with this and other asteroseismic age samples.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic stellar structure in the Fierz--Pauli theory and generic linear massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of static spherical stars composed of non-relativistic matter in linear massive gravity with or without the Fierz-Pauli (FP) tuning. Adopting a polytropic equation of state, we construct master differential equations for the stellar profile function, which is fourth order in the FP theory or sixth order in generic non-FP theories, where the difference in the differential order reflects the presence of a ghost spin-0 graviton in the latter. In both cases, even when the spin-0 ghost is present, we find exact solutions with finite radius for the polytropic indices n = 0 and 1. Analyzing the dependences of the stellar radius, mass, and Yukawa charge on the graviton masses, we observe that a discontinuous behavior arises in the massless limit of the FP theory similarly to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity, while it is absent in non-FP theories. We discuss rough observational constraints on the graviton masses.</description>

      <title>Probing Stellar Clusters from Gaia DR2 as Galactic PeVatrons: I -- Expected Gamma-ray and Neutrino Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young &amp; massive stellar clusters (SCs) are a potential source of galactic cosmic rays up to very high energies as a result of two possible acceleration scenarios. Collective stellar winds from massive member stars form a wind-blown bubble with a termination shock (TS) at which particle acceleration to PeV energies may occur. Furthermore, shock acceleration may occur at SNRs expanding inside the bubble. By applying a model of CR acceleration at both the wind TS and SNR shocks to catalogues of known SCs derived from Gaia DR2, we identify the most promising targets to search for evidence of PeVatron activity. Predictions for the secondary fluxes of gamma-ray and neutrino emission are derived based on particle acceleration at the collective wind TS and the subsequent hadronic interactions with the surrounding medium. Predictions from our modelling under baseline and optimistic scenarios are compared to data, finding consistent results. We estimate the detection prospects for future gamma-ray and neutrino experiments. We find that degree-scale angular sizes of the wind-blown bubbles are typical, that may pose a challenge for experimental detection. A shortlist of the most promising candidates is provided, with an anticipated flux range. Of order 10 SCs may be detectable with future facilities, and 1-5 could be currently operating as PeVatrons. Of these, three gamma-ray detected SCs have data within our predicted range. Our model can consistently describe gamma-ray measurements of SC emission. Several further as-yet-undetected SCs offer promising targets for future observations, although the flux range allowed by our model can be large (&gt; factor 10). The large angular size of the wind-blown bubble may lead to low surface brightness emission, worsening the problem of source confusion. Nevertheless, we discuss how further work will help to constrain SCs as PeVatron candidates. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Quantitative modelling of type Ia supernovae spectral time series: Constraining the explosion physics</title>

Abstract: Multiple explosion mechanisms have been proposed to explain type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Through forward modelling, synthetic observables of explosion models can be directly compared to observations of SNe Ia to constrain the explosion physics. Due to the computational expense associated with multi-dimensional explosion and radiative transfer simulations however, empirical modelling tools have also been developed that allow for fast, customised modelling of individual SNe. Such tools have provided useful insights, but the subjective nature with which empirical modelling is performed makes it difficult to obtain robust constraints on the explosion physics or expand studies to large populations of objects. Machine learning accelerated tools have therefore begun to gain traction. In this paper, we present riddler, a framework for automated fitting of SNe Ia spectral sequences up to shortly after maximum light. We train a series of neural networks on realistic ejecta profiles predicted by the W7 and N100 explosion models to emulate full radiative transfer simulations and apply nested sampling to determine the best-fitting model parameters for multiple spectra of a given SN simultaneously. We show that riddler is able to accurately recover the parameters of input spectra and use it to fit observations of two well-studied SNe Ia. We also investigate the impact of different weighting schemes when performing quantitative spectral fitting. As spectroscopic samples of SNe Ia continue to grow, automated spectral fitting tools such as riddler will become increasingly important to maximise the physical constraints that can be gained in a quantitative and consistent manner.</description>

      <title>The Tarantula $-$ Revealed by X-rays (T-ReX)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Tarantula Nebula (30 Doradus) is the most important star-forming complex in the Local Group, offering a microscope on starburst astrophysics. At its heart lies the exceptionally rich young stellar cluster R136, containing the most massive stars known. Stellar winds and supernovae have carved 30 Dor into an amazing display of arcs, pillars, and bubbles. We present first results and advanced data processing products from the 2-Ms Chandra X-ray Visionary Project, "The Tarantula $-$ Revealed by X-rays" (T-ReX). The 3615 point sources in the T-ReX catalog include massive stars, compact objects, binaries, bright pre-main-sequence stars and compact young stellar (sub)clusters in 30 Dor. After removing point sources and excluding the exceptionally bright supernova remnant N157B (30 Dor B), the global diffuse X-ray maps reveal hot plasma structures resolved at 1$-$10 pc scales, with an absorption-corrected total-band (0.5$-$7 keV) X-ray luminosity of $2.110\times 10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Spatially-resolved spectral modeling provides evidence for emission lines enhanced by charge-exchange processes at the interfaces. We identify a candidate for the oldest X-ray pulsar detected to date in 30 Dor, PSR J0538-6902, inside a newly-resolved arctuate X-ray wind nebula, the Manta Ray. The long time baseline of T-ReX monitored dozens of massive stars, several showing periodic variability tied to binary orbital periods, and captured strong flares from at least three low-mass Galactic foreground stars.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear wave damping by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability induced turbulence</title>

Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic kink waves naturally form as a consequence of perturbations to a structured medium, for example transverse oscillations of coronal loops. Linear theory has provided many insights in the evolution of linear oscillations, and results from these models are often applied to infer information about the solar corona from observed wave periods and damping times. However, simulations show that nonlinear kink waves can host the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi) which subsequently creates turbulence in the loop, dynamics which are beyond linear models. In this paper we investigate the evolution of KHi-induced turbulence on the surface of a flux tube where a non-linear fundamental kink-mode has been excited. We control our numerical experiment so that we induce the KHi without exciting resonant absorption. We find two stages in the KHi turbulence dynamics. In the first stage, we show that the classic model of a KHi turbulent layer growing $\propto t$is applicable. We adapt this model to make accurate predictions for damping of the oscillation and turbulent heating as a consequence of the KHi dynamics. In the second stage, the now dominant turbulent motions are undergoing decay. We find that the classic model of energy decay proportional to $t^{-2}$ approximately holds and provides an accurate prediction of the heating in this phase. Our results show that we can develop simple models for the turbulent evolution of a non-linear kink wave, but the damping profiles produced are distinct from those of linear theory that are commonly used to confront theory and observations.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project X. Large-scale quantitative spectroscopic analysis of Galactic luminous blue stars</title>

Abstract: Blue supergiants (BSGs) are key objects for understanding the evolution of massive stars. However, discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical observations have opened up important questions yet to be answered. Studying statistically significant and unbiased samples of BSGs can help to improve the situation. We aim to perform a homogeneous and comprehensive quantitative spectroscopic analysis of a large sample of Galactic luminous blue stars (being the majority BSGs) from the IACOB spectroscopic database. We derive the projected rotational velocity ($v\sin i$) and macroturbulent broadening ($v_{\rm mac}$) using IACOB-BROAD. We used FASTWIND computations to derive effective temperatures ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravities, microturbulences ($\xi$), Si and He surface abundances, and the wind-strength parameter. We provide estimates of these quantities for the largest sample of Galactic luminous O9-B5 stars spectroscopically analyzed to date, with 527 targets. We find a drop in the relative number of stars at ~21 kK, coinciding with a scarcity of fast rotating stars below that temperature. We speculate that this feature might be roughly delineating the location of the Terminal-Age-Main-Sequence in the 15-85M$_\odot$ range. By investigating the main characteristics of the $v\sin i$ distribution as a function of $T_{\rm eff}$, we propose that an efficient mechanism transporting angular momentum from the stellar core to the surface might be operating along the main sequence. We find correlations between $\xi$, $v_{\rm mac}$ and the spectroscopic luminosity. We also find that no more than 20% of the stars in our sample have atmospheres clearly enriched in He, and suggest that the origin of this specific sub-sample might be in binary evolution. We do not find clear empirical evidence of an increase in the wind-strength over the wind bi-stability region towards lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>Episodic eruptions of young accreting stars: the key role of disc thermal instability due to Hydrogen ionisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical grouping of large magnitude episodic variability of young accreting stars, FUORs outshine their stars by a factor of $\sim$ 100, and can last for up to centuries; EXORs are dimmer, and last months to a year. A disc Hydrogen ionisation Thermal Instability (TI) scenario was previously proposed for FUORs but required unrealistically low disc viscosity. In the last decade, many intermediate type objects, e.g., FUOR-like in luminosity and spectra but EXOR-like in duration were found. Here we show that the intermediate type bursters Gaia20eae, PTF14jg, Gaia19bey and Gaia21bty may be naturally explained by the TI scenario with realistic viscosity values. We argue that TI predicts a dearth (desert) of bursts with peak accretion rates between $\dot M \sim 10^{-6} M_\odot$/yr and $\dot M \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$/yr, and that this desert is seen in the sample of all the bursters with previously determined $\dot M$ burst. Most classic EXORs (FUORs) appear to be on the cold (hot) branch of the S-curve during the peak light of their eruptions; thus TI may play a role in this class differentiation. At the same time, TI is unable to explain how classic FUORs can last for up to centuries, and over-predicts the occurrence rate of short FUORs by at least an order of magnitude. We conclude that TI is a required ingredient of episodic accretion operating at R &lt; 0.1 au, but additional physics must play a role at larger scales. Knowledge of TI inner workings from related disciplines may enable its use as a tool to constrain the nature of this additional physics.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an asteroseismological analysis on the non-Blazhko ab-type RR Lyrae star EPIC 248846335 employing the Radial Stellar Pulsations (RSP) module of the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) based on the set of stellar parameters. The atmospheric parameters as $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 6933$\pm$70 $K$, log $g$ = 3.35$\pm$ 0.50 and [Fe/H] = -1.18 $\pm$ 0.14 are estimated from the Low-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR9. The luminosity $L$ = 49.70$_{-1.80}^{+2.99}$ $L_\odot$ and mass M = 0.56 $\pm$ 0.07 $M_\odot$ are calculated, respectively, using the distance provided by Gaia and the metallicity estimated from the Low-Resolution Spectra. The Fourier parameters of the light curves observed by $K2$ and RV curves determined from the Medium-Resolution Spectra of LAMOST DR10 are also calculated in this work. The period of the fundamental mode of the star and the residuals $r$ of the Fourier parameters between the models and observations serve to select optimal model, whose stellar parameters are $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = 6700 $\pm$ 220 K, log $g$ = 2.70, [Fe/H] = -1.20 $\pm$ 0.2, M = 0.59 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$, and $L$ = 56.0 $\pm$ 4.2 $L_\odot$. The projection factors are constrained as 1.20 $\pm$ 0.02 and 1.59 $\pm$ 0.13 by the blue- and red-arm observed velocities with their corresponding RV curves derived from the best-fit model, respectively. The precise determination of stellar parameters in ab-type RR Lyrae stars is crucial for understanding the physical processes that occur during pulsation and for providing a deeper understanding of its Period-Luminosity relationship.</description>

      <title>Simulating gamma-ray production from cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere in the presence of coronal magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic rays can interact with the solar atmosphere and produce a slew of secondary messengers, making the Sun a bright gamma-ray source in the sky. Detailed observations with Fermi-LAT have shown that these interactions must be strongly affected by solar magnetic fields in order to produce the wide range of observational features, such as high flux and hard spectrum. However, the detailed mechanisms behind these features are still a mystery. In this work, we tackle this problem by performing particle interaction simulations in the solar atmosphere in the presence of coronal magnetic fields modelled using the potential field source surface (PFSS) model. We find that the low-energy (~GeV) gamma-ray production is significantly enhanced by the coronal magnetic fields, but the enhancement decreases rapidly with energy. The enhancement is directly correlated with the production of gamma rays with large deviation angles relative to the input cosmic-ray direction. We conclude that coronal magnetic fields are essential for correctly modeling solar disk gamma rays below 10GeV, but above that the effect of coronal magnetic fields diminishes. Other magnetic field structures are needed to explain the high-energy disk emission.</description>

      <title>Testing a new general diffractive formula with gravitational wave source lensed by a supermassive black hole in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For long wavelength gravitational wave (GW), it is easy to diffract when it is lensed by celestial objects. Traditional diffractive integral formula has ignored large angle diffraction, which is adopted in most of cases. However, in some special cases (e. g. a GW source lensed by a supermassive black hole in a binary system, where the lens is close to the source), large angle diffraction could be important. Our previous works have proposed a new general diffractive integral formula which is also valid for large angle diffraction case. In this paper, we have investigated how much difference between this general diffractive formula and traditional diffractive integral formula could be under these special cases with different parameters. We find that the module of amplification factor for general diffractive formula could become smaller than that of traditional diffractive integral basically with a factor $r_F\simeq0.806$ when the distance between lens and sources is $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU and lens mass $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$. Their difference is so significant that it is detectable. Furthermore, we find that the proportionality factor $r_F$ is gradually increasing from 0.5 to 1 with increasing $D_{\rm LS}$ and it is decreasing with increasing $M_{\rm L}$. As long as $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (with $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (with $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU ), the difference between new and traditional formulas is enough significant to be detectable. It is promising to test this new general diffractive formula in the future GW detection.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic observations of progenitor activity 100 days before a Type Ibn supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15148v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Obtaining spectroscopic observations of the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae is often unfeasible due to an inherent lack of knowledge as to which stars will go supernova and when they will explode. In this letter, we present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the progenitor activity of SN 2023fyq in the preceding 150 days before the He-rich progenitor exploded as a Type Ibn supernova. The progenitor of SN 2023fyq shows an exponential rise in flux prior to core-collapse. Complex He I emission line features are observed, with a P-Cygni like profile, as well as an evolving broad base with velocities on the order of 10,000 km/s, possibly due to electron scattering. The luminosity and evolution of SN 2023fyq are consistent with a faint Type Ibn, reaching a peak r-band magnitude of 18.1 mag, although there is some uncertainty in the distance to the host, NGC 4388, located in the Virgo cluster. We present additional evidence of asymmetric He-rich material being present prior to the explosion of SN 2023fyq, as well as after, suggesting this material has survived the ejecta-CSM interaction. Broad [O I] and the Ca II triplet lines are observed at late phases, confirming that SN 2023fyq was a genuine supernova rather than a non-terminal interacting transient. SN 2023fyq provides insight into the final moments of a massive star's life, highlighting that the progenitor is likely highly unstable before core-collapse.</description>

      <title>High-precision astrometry with VVV -- II. A near-infrared extension of Gaia into the Galactic plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims. We use near-infrared, ground-based data from the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey to indirectly extend the astrometry provided by the Gaia catalog to objects in heavily-extincted regions towards the Galactic bulge and plane that are beyond Gaia's reach. Methods. We make use of the state-of-the-art techniques developed for high-precision astrometry and photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope to process the VVV data. We employ empirical, spatially-variable, effective point-spread functions and local transformations to mitigate the effects of systematic errors, like residual geometric distortion and image motion, and to improve measurements in crowded fields and for faint stars. We also anchor our astrometry to the absolute reference frame of the Gaia Data Release 3. Results. We measure between 20 and 60 times more sources than Gaia in the region surrounding the Galactic center, obtaining an single-exposure precision of about 12 mas and a proper-motion precision of better than 1 mas yr$^{-1}$ for bright, unsaturated sources. Our astrometry provides an extension of Gaia into the Galactic center. We publicly release the astro-photometric catalogs of the two VVV fields considered in this work, which contain a total of $\sim$ 3.5 million sources. Our catalogs cover $\sim$ 3 sq. degrees, about 0.5% of the entire VVV survey area.</description>

      <title>Observing the Galactic Underworld: Predicting photometry and astrometry from compact remnant microlensing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Isolated black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs) are largely undetectable across the electromagnetic spectrum. For this reason, our only real prospect of observing these isolated compact remnants is via microlensing; a feat recently performed for the first time. However, characterisation of the microlensing events caused by BHs and NSs is still in its infancy. In this work, we perform N-body simulations to explore the frequency and physical characteristics of microlensing events across the entire sky. Our simulations find that every year we can expect $88_{-6}^{+6}$ BH, $6.8_{-1.6}^{+1.7}$ NS and $20^{+30}_{-20}$ stellar microlensing events which cause an astrometric shift larger than 2~mas. Similarly, we can expect $21_{-3}^{+3}$ BH, $18_{-3}^{+3}$ NS and $7500_{-500}^{+500}$ stellar microlensing events which cause a bump magnitude larger than 1~mag. Leveraging a more comprehensive dynamical model than prior work, we predict the fraction of microlensing events caused by BHs as a function of Einstein time to be smaller than previously thought. Comparison of our microlensing simulations to events in Gaia finds good agreement. Finally, we predict that in the combination of Gaia and GaiaNIR data there will be $14700_{-900}^{+600}$ BH and $1600_{-200}^{+300}$ NS events creating a centroid shift larger than 1~mas and $330_{-120}^{+100}$ BH and $310_{-100}^{+110}$ NS events causing bump magnitudes $&lt; -1$. Of these, $&lt;10$ BH and $5_{-5}^{+10}$ NS events should be detectable using current analysis techniques. These results inform future astrometric mission design, such as GaiaNIR, as they indicate that, compared to stellar events, there are fewer observable BH events than previously thought.</description>
