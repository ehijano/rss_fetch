      <title>On tested Bousfield-Friedlander localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a Bousfield-Friedlander localization with a set of test morphisms in the sense introduced by Bandklayder, Bergner, Griffiths, Johnson, and Santhanam can also be characterized as a left Bousfield localization at the set of test morphisms. This viewpoint enables us to establish a homogeneous model structure associated with any calculus arising from a Bousfield-Friedlander localization of this form. As a corollary, we show that homogeneous functors in discrete calculus coincide up to homotopy with those in Goodwillie calculus. Finally, we illustrate this framework by proving that the polynomial model structure of Weiss calculus is a particular instance of tested Bousfield-Friedlander localization.</description>

      <title>Lie superalgebras in characteristic 2 and mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of a Lie superalgebra over a field $k$ of characteristic $2$ which unifies the two pre-existing ones - $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded Lie algebras with a squaring map and Lie algebras in the Verlinde category ${\rm Ver}_4^+(k)$, and prove the PBW theorem for this notion. We also do the same for the restricted version. Finally, discuss mixed characteristic deformation theory of such Lie superalgebras (for perfect $k$), introducing and studying a natural lift of our notion of Lie superalgebra to characteristic zero - the notion of a mixed Lie superalgebra over a ramified quadratic extension $R$ of the ring of Witt vectors $W(k)$.</description>

      <title>Rewriting techniques for relative coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18170v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of works has established rewriting as an essential tool in order to prove coherence properties of algebraic structures, such as MacLane's coherence theorem for monoidal categories, based on the observation that, under reasonable assumptions, confluence diagrams for critical pairs provide the required coherence axioms. We are interested here in extending this approach simultaneously in two directions. Firstly, we want to take into account situations where coherence is partial, in the sense that it only applies to a subset of the structural morphisms. Secondly, we are interested in structures which are cartesian in the sense that variables can be duplicated or erased. We develop theorems and rewriting techniques in order to achieve this, first in the setting of abstract rewriting systems, and then extend them to term rewriting systems, suitably generalized to take coherence into account. As an illustration of our results, we explain how to recover the coherence theorems for monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Localizing and colocalizing subcategories on schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A full triangulated subcategory $\mathsf{L} \subset \mathsf{T}$ of triangulated category $\mathsf{T}$ is \emph{localizing} if it is stable for coproducts. If, further, $\mathsf{T}$ is $\otimes$-triangulated, we say that $\mathsf{L}$ is $\otimes$-ideal if $F \otimes G \in \mathsf{L}$ for all $G \in \mathsf{L}$ and all $F \in \mathsf{T}$. Analogously, a full triangulated subcategory $\mathsf{C} \subset \mathsf{T}$ is \emph{colocalizing} if it is stable for products. If, further, $\mathsf{T}$ is \emph{closed}, \textit{i.e.} $\otimes$-triangulated with internal homs (denoted $[-,-]$), we say that $\mathsf{C}$ is $\mathcal{H}$-coideal if $[F, G] \in \mathsf{C}$ for all $G \in \mathsf{C}$ and all $F \in \mathsf{T}$.
  For a point generated concentrated scheme $X$, we prove that all $\otimes$-ideal localizing subcategories of $\mathbf{D}_{qc}(X)$ are classified by the subsets of $X$. As a consequence, we prove that for $\mathcal{H}$-coideal colocalizing subcategories of $\mathbf{D}_{qc}(X)$ the same holds. Moreover, every such colocalizing subcategory $\mathsf{C}$ is of the form $\mathsf{C} = \mathsf{L}^\perp$, where $\mathsf{L}$ is a $\otimes$-ideal localizing subcategory.</description>

      <title>Term Assignment and Categorical Models for Intuitionistic Linear Logic with Subexponentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a typed lambda calculus ${\bf SILL}(\lambda)_{\Sigma}$, a type-theoretic version of intuitionistic linear logic with subexponentials, that is, we have many resource comonadic modalities with some interconnections between them given by a subexponential signature. We also give proof normalisation rules and prove the strong normalisation and Church-Rosser properties for $\beta$-reduction by adapting the Tait-Girard method to subexponential modalities. Further, we analyse subexponentials from the point of view of categorical logic. We introduce the concepts of a Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage to characterise models of linear type theories with a single exponential and affine and relevant subexponentials and a more general case respectively. We also generalise several known results from linear logic and show that every Cocteau category and a $\Sigma$-assemblage can be viewed as a symmetric monoidal closed category equipped with a family of monoidal adjunctions of a particular kind. In the final section, we give a stronger 2-categorical characterisation of Cocteau categories.</description>
