      <title>"Chirpons": one-dimensional phase singularities as atypical local oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, phase singularities embedded in a wavepacket are shown to act as sources of atypical localized oscillations when the packet interacts with a linear system. We refer to these oscillations as \textit{chirpons}, since they arise as strong variations of the instantaneous frequency (chirp). A mathematical expression is then provided to describe \textit{chirpons}, and their behavior is explored through the interaction of a super-bandwidth wavepacket -- containing two singularities -- with a damped harmonic oscillator, a fundamental model for many physical systems. This interaction is analyzed theoretically, and the predictions are verified experimentally using a resonant electrical circuit as a realization of the oscillator. The results show that \textit{chirpons} evolve in a manner fundamentally different from standard Fourier oscillations, revealing features of linear systems that are otherwise inaccessible. This introduces a new approach to analyze and characterize system responses, with potential applications in high-resolution spectroscopy and signal sensing.</description>

      <title>Holographic connection of f(G) gravity through Barrow and a generalized version of holographic dark fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of f(G) modified gravity, we address the cosmic application of the most generalized form of holographic dark energy (The European Physical Journal C, 77, (2017): 1-8) in this study, as well as a specific instance of it in the form of Barrow holographic dark energy (Physical Review D, 102(12), p.123525). Holographic dark energy and a well-known power law form of the scale factor a(t) are added to the f(G) model in order to achieve this. It is observed that a sufficient criterion for a realistic modified gravity model is satisfied by the reconstructed f(G). The reconstruction models are also tested under the four energy situations.</description>

      <title>Plasma Core Rocket Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic physics for plasma core rocket engines was already completed in 1985. At the time successful containment of a fissioning uranium hexafluoride U(93%)F6 plasma was achieved for ~120 seconds using an argon vortex. Unfortunately, hydrodynamic confinement of a fissioning fuel in a gas core nuclear rocket without uranium loss is probably unachievable. This article proposes a plasma core that is magnetically contained and uses one of many possible stable force-free magnetic field configurations.</description>
