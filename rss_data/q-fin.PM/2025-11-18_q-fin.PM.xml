      <title>On the utility problem in a market where price impact is transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete-time model of a financial market where a risky asset is bought and sold with transactions having a transient price impact. It is shown that the corresponding utility maximization problem admits a solution. We manage to remove some unnatural restrictions on the market depth and resilience processes that were present in earlier work. A non-standard feature of the problem is that the set of attainable portfolio values may fail the convexity property.</description>

      <title>Basis Immunity: Isotropy as a Regularizer for Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diversification is a cornerstone of robust portfolio construction, yet its application remains fraught with challenges due to model uncertainty and estimation errors. Practitioners often rely on sophisticated, proprietary heuristics to navigate these issues. Among recent advancements, Agnostic Risk Parity introduces eigenrisk parity (ERP), an innovative approach that leverages isotropy to evenly allocate risk across eigenmodes, enhancing portfolio stability.
  In this paper, we review and extend the isotropy-enforced philosophy of ERP proposing a versatile framework that integrates mean-variance optimization with an isotropy constraint acting as a geometric regularizer against signal uncertainty. The resulting allocations decompose naturally into canonical portfolios, smoothly interpolating between full isotropy (closed-form isotropic-mean allocation) and pure mean-variance through a tunable isotropy penalty.
  Beyond methodology, we revisit fundamental concepts and clarify foundational links between isotropy, canonical portfolios, principal portfolios, primal versus dual representations, and intrinsic basis-invariant metrics for returns, risk, and isotropy. Applied to sector trend-following, the isotropy constraint systematically induces negative average-signal exposure -- a structural, parameter-robust crash hedge.
  This work offers both a practical, theoretically grounded tool for resilient allocation under signal uncertainty and a pedagogical synthesis of modern portfolio concepts.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Automated Stock Trading: An Ensemble Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock trading strategies play a critical role in investment. However, it is challenging to design a profitable strategy in a complex and dynamic stock market. In this paper, we propose an ensemble strategy that employs deep reinforcement schemes to learn a stock trading strategy by maximizing investment return. We train a deep reinforcement learning agent and obtain an ensemble trading strategy using three actor-critic based algorithms: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Advantage Actor Critic (A2C), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The ensemble strategy inherits and integrates the best features of the three algorithms, thereby robustly adjusting to different market situations. In order to avoid the large memory consumption in training networks with continuous action space, we employ a load-on-demand technique for processing very large data. We test our algorithms on the 30 Dow Jones stocks that have adequate liquidity. The performance of the trading agent with different reinforcement learning algorithms is evaluated and compared with both the Dow Jones Industrial Average index and the traditional min-variance portfolio allocation strategy. The proposed deep ensemble strategy is shown to outperform the three individual algorithms and two baselines in terms of the risk-adjusted return measured by the Sharpe ratio.

      <title>A Practical Machine Learning Approach for Dynamic Stock Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock recommendation is vital to investment companies and investors. However, no single stock selection strategy will always win while analysts may not have enough time to check all S&amp;P 500 stocks (the Standard &amp; Poor's 500). In this paper, we propose a practical scheme that recommends stocks from S&amp;P 500 using machine learning. Our basic idea is to buy and hold the top 20% stocks dynamically. First, we select representative stock indicators with good explanatory power. Secondly, we take five frequently used machine learning methods, including linear regression, ridge regression, stepwise regression, random forest and generalized boosted regression, to model stock indicators and quarterly log-return in a rolling window. Thirdly, we choose the model with the lowest Mean Square Error in each period to rank stocks. Finally, we test the selected stocks by conducting portfolio allocation methods such as equally weighted, mean-variance, and minimum-variance. Our empirical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the long-only strategy on the S&amp;P 500 index in terms of Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.

      <title>Discovery of a 13-Sharpe OOS Factor: Drift Regimes Unlock Hidden Cross-Sectional Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We document a high-performing cross-sectional equity factor that achieves out-of-sample Sharpe ratios above 13 through regime-conditional signal activation. The strategy combines value and short-term reversal signals only during stock-specific drift regimes, defined as periods when individual stocks show more than 60 percent positive days in trailing 63-day windows. Under these conditions, the factor delivers annualized returns of 158.6 percent with 12.0 percent volatility and a maximum drawdown of minus 11.9 percent. Using rigorous walk-forward validation across 20 years of S&amp;P 500 data (2004 to 2024), we show performance roughly 13 times stronger than market benchmarks on a risk-adjusted basis, produced entirely out-of-sample with frozen parameters. The factor passes extensive robustness tests, including 1,000 randomization trials with p-values below 0.001, and maintains Sharpe ratios above 7 even under 30 percent parameter perturbations. Exposure to standard risk factors is negligible, with total R-squared values below 3 percent. We provide mechanistic evidence that drift regimes reshape market microstructure by amplifying behavioral biases, altering liquidity patterns, and creating conditions where cross-sectional price discovery becomes systematically exploitable. Conservative capacity estimates indicate deployable capital of 100 to 500 million dollars before noticeable performance degradation.</description>
