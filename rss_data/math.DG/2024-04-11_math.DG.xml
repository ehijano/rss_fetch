      <title>A Gauss-Bonnet-Chern type obstruction for Killing vector fields on Lorentzian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new curvature obstruction to the existence of a timelike (resp. causal) Killing or homothetic vector field $X$ on an even-dimensional (odd-dimensional) Lorentzian manifold, in terms of its timelike (resp. null) sectional curvature is given. As a consequence for the compact case, the well-known Gauss-Bonnet-Chern obstruction to the existence of semi-Riemannian metrics is extended from non-zero constant sectional curvature to non-zero timelike sectional curvature on $X$.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue Estimates for Asymptotically Hyperbolic Manifolds and their Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a sharp upper bound for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_{1,p}$ of the $p$-Laplacian on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We then prove that a particular class of conformally compact submanifolds within asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds are themselves asymptotically hyperbolic. As a corollary, we show that for any minimal conformally compact submanifold $Y^{k+1}$ within $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}(-1)$, $\lambda_{1,p}(Y)=\left(\frac{k}{p}\right)^{p}$. We then obtain lower bounds on $\lambda_{1,2}(Y)$ in the case where minimality is replaced with a bounded mean curvature assumption and where the ambient space is a general Poincar\'e-Einstein space whose conformal infinity is of non-negative Yamabe type. In the process, we introduce an invariant $\hat \beta^Y$ for each such submanifold, enabling us to generalize a result due to Cheung-Leung.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature and fundamental groups of effective regular sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Gromov-Hausdorff convergent sequence of closed manifolds $M_i^n\overset{GH}\longrightarrow X$ with $\mathrm{Ric}\ge-(n-1)$, $\mathrm{diam}(M_i)\le D$, and $\mathrm{vol}(M_i)\ge v&gt;0$, we study the relation between $\pi_1(M_i)$ and $X$. It was known before that there is a surjective homomorphism $\phi_i:\pi_1(M_i)\to \pi_1(X)$ by the work of Pan-Wei. In this paper, we construct a surjective homomorphism from the interior of the effective regular set in $X$ back to $M_i$, that is, $\psi_i:\pi_1(\mathcal{R}_{\epsilon,\delta}^\circ)\to \pi_1(M_i)$. These surjective homomorphisms $\phi_i$ and $\psi_i$ are natural in the sense that their composition $\phi_i \circ \psi_i$ is exactly the homomorphism induced by the inclusion map $\mathcal{R}_{\epsilon,\delta}^\circ \hookrightarrow X$.</description>

      <title>Brock-type isoperimetric inequality for Steklov eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by imposing suitable assumptions on the weighted function, (under the constraint of fixed weighted volume) a Brock-type isoperimetric inequality for Steklov-type eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in a Euclidean space or a hyperbolic space has been proven. This conclusion is actually an interesting extension of F. Brock's classical result about the isoperimetric inequality for Steklov eigenvalues of the Laplacian given in the influential paper [Z. Angew. Math. Mech. 81 (2001) 69-71]. Besides, a related open problem has also been proposed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the abundance conjecture for minimal projective klt varieties $X$ satisfying Miyaoka's equality $3c_2(X) = c_{1}(X)^{2}$. Specifically, we prove that the canonical divisor $K_{X}$ is semi-ample and the Kodaira dimension $\kappa(K_{X})$ is either $0$, $1$, or $2$. Moreover, according to the Kodaira dimension, we reveal the structure of the Iitaka fibration of $X$ up to quasi-\'etale covers. Additionally, we show similar results for projective klt varieties with nef anti-canonical divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a differential inclusion on a manifold, defined by a field of open half-spaces whose boundary in each tangent space is the kernel of a one-form. We make the assumption that the corank one distribution associated to the kernel is completely nonholonomic. We identify a subset of solutions of the differential inclusion, satisfying two endpoints and periodic boundary conditions, which are homotopically equivalent in the $W^{1,p}$-topology, for any $p\in [1,+\infty)$, to the based loop space and the free loop space respectively.</description>

      <title>Representability of Elliptic Moduli Problems in Derived $C^{\infty}$-Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of solutions of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations on manifolds in the framework of derived $C^{\infty}$-geometry. For an arbitrary smooth stack $S$, we define $S$-families of nonlinear PDEs acting between $S$-families of submersions over an $S$-family of manifolds and show that in case the family of PDEs is elliptic and the base family of manifolds is proper over $S$, then the moduli stack of solutions is relatively representable by quasi-smooth derived $C^{\infty}$-schemes over $S$. Along the way, we develop tools to analyse the local structure of families of mapping stacks between manifolds and explain how to compare mapping stacks in smooth and in derived geometry. To access the notion of a family of PDEs over an arbitrary smooth base stack, we introduce a formalism of stacks of relative jets. Finally, we show how natural ideas from (higher) topos theory can be leveraged to facilitate the application of nonlinear Fredholm analysis to derived stacks of solutions of elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology with DG Coefficients. Applications to cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define Hamiltonian Floer homology with differential graded (DG) local coefficients for symplectically aspherical manifolds. The differential of the underlying complex involves chain representatives of the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Floer trajectories of arbitrary dimension. This setup allows in particular to define and compute Floer homology with coefficients in chains on fibers of fibrations over the free loop space of the underlying symplectic manifold. We develop the DG Floer toolset, including continuation maps and homotopies, and we also define and study symplectic homology groups with DG local coefficients. We define spectral invariants and establish general criteria for almost existence of contractible periodic orbits on regular energy levels of Hamiltonian systems inside Liouville domains.
  In the case of cotangent bundles, we prove a Viterbo isomorphism theorem with DG local coefficients. This serves as a stepping stone for applications to the almost existence of contractible closed characteristics on closed smooth hypersurfaces. In this context, our methods allow to access for the first time the dichotomy between closed manifolds that are aspherical and those that are not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Levi-Civita connection on the noncommutative differential one-forms of a spectral triple $(\B,\H,\D)$, we define the full Riemann curvature tensor, the Ricci curvature tensor and scalar curvature. We give a definition of Dirac spectral triples and derive a general Weitzenbock formula for them. We apply these tools to $\theta$-deformations of compact Riemannian manifolds. We show that the Riemann and Ricci tensors transform naturally under $\theta$-deformation, whereas the connection Laplacian, Clifford representation of the curvature and the scalar curvature are all invariant under deformation.</description>

Abstract: We prove new variation formulae for the volume of coassociative submanifolds, expressed in terms of $G_2$ data. As a special case, we obtain a second variation formula for variations within the moduli space of coassociative submanifolds; this formula highlights the role of the ambient torsion and Ricci curvature. These results apply, for example, to coassociative fibrations. We illustrate our formulae with several examples, both homogeneous and non.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we focus on describing the space of bi-invariant metrics in a Lie group up to isometry. I.e, that is, metrics invariant under both left and right translations. We show that $\mathfrak{BI}$, the moduli space of bi-invariant metrics, is an orbifold. Moreover we give an explicit description of this orbifold, and of $\mathfrak{EBI}$, the space of bi-invariant metrics equivalent under isometries and scalar multiplies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second author and H. Yin have developed a Ricci flow existence theory that gives a complete Ricci flow starting with a surface equipped with a conformal structure and a nonatomic Radon measure as a conformal factor. This led to the discovery of a large array of new expanding Ricci solitons. In this paper we use the recent uniqueness theory in this context, also developed by the second author and H. Yin, to give a complete classification of all expanding Ricci solitons on surfaces. Along the way, we prove a converse to the existence theory that is not constrained to solitons: every complete Ricci flow on a surface over a time interval $(0,\varepsilon)$ admits a $t\downarrow 0$ limit within the class of admissible initial data. This makes surfaces the first nontrivial setting for Ricci flow in which a bijection can be given between the entire set of complete Ricci flows over maximal time intervals $(0,T)$, and a class of initial data that induces them.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a calibration $\alpha$ whose stabilizer acts transitively on the Grassmanian of calibrated planes, we introduce a nontrivial Lie-theoretic condition on $\alpha$, which we call compliancy, and show that this condition holds for many interesting geometric calibrations, including K\"ahler, special Lagrangian, associative, coassociative, and Cayley. We determine a sufficient condition that ensures compliancy of $\alpha$, we completely characterize compliancy in terms of properties of a natural involution determined by a calibrated plane, and we relate compliancy to the geometry of the calibrated Grassmanian.
  The condition that a Riemannian immersion $\iota \colon L \to M$ be calibrated is a first order condition. By contrast, its extrinsic geometry, given by the second fundamental form $A$ and the induced tangent and normal connections $\nabla$ on $TL$ and $D$ on $NL$, respectively, is second order information. We characterize the conditions imposed on the extrinsic geometric data $(A, \nabla, D)$ when the Riemannian immersion $\iota \colon L \to M$ is calibrated with respect to a calibration $\alpha$ on $M$ which is both parallel and compliant. This motivate the definition of an infinitesimally calibrated Riemannian immersion, generalizing the classical notion of a superminimal surface in $\mathbb R^4$.</description>

      <title>On ${\cal M}$-Theory Dual of Large-$N$ Thermal QCD-Like Theories up to ${\cal O}(R^4)$ and $G$-Structure Classification of Underlying Non-Supersymmetric Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.07259v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Construction of a top-down holographic dual of thermal QCD-like theories (equivalence class of theories which are UV-conformal, IR-confining and have fundamental quarks) {\it at intermediate 't Hooft coupling} and the $G$-structure (torsion classes) classification of the underlying geometries (in the Infra Red (IR)/non-conformal sector in particular) of the {\it non-supersymmetric} string/${\cal M}$-theory duals, have been missing in the literature. We take the first important steps in this direction by studying the ${\cal M}$ theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate gauge and 't Hooft couplings and obtaining the ${\cal O}(l_p^6)$ corrections arising from the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ terms to the "MQGP" background (${\cal M}$-theory dual of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories at intermediate gauge/string coupling, but large 't Hooft coupling) of \cite{MQGP}. The main Physics lesson learnt is that there is a competition between non-conformal IR enhancement and Planckian and large-$N$ suppression and going to orders beyond the ${\cal O}(l_p^6)$ is necessitated if the IR enhancement wins out. The main lesson learnt in Math is in the context of the differential geometry ($G$-structure classification) of the internal manifolds relevant to the string/${\cal M}$-theory duals of large-$N$ thermal QCD-like theories, wherein we obtain for the first time inclusive of the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections in the Infra-Red (IR), the $SU(3)$-structure torsion classes of the type IIA mirror of \cite{metrics} (making contact en route with Siegel theta functions related to appropriate hyperelliptic curves, as well as the Kiepert's algorithm of solving quintics), and the $G_2/SU(4)/Spin(7)$-structure torsion classes of the seven- and eight-folds associated with its ${\cal M}$ theory uplift.</description>
