      <title>Achieving designed texture and flows in bulk active nematics using optimal control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being intrinsically nonequilibrium, active materials can potentially perform functions that would be thermodynamically forbidden in passive materials. However, active systems have diverse local attractors that correspond to distinct dynamical states, many of which exhibit chaotic turbulent-like dynamics and thus cannot perform work or useful functions. Designing such a system to choose a specific dynamical state is a formidable challenge. Motivated by recent advances enabling opto-genetic control of experimental active materials, we describe an optimal control theory framework that identifies a spatiotemporal sequence of light-generated activity that drives an active nematic system toward a prescribed dynamical steady-state. Active nematics are unstable to spontaneous defect proliferation and chaotic streaming dynamics in the absence of control. We demonstrate that optimal control theory can compute activity fields that redirect the dynamics into a variety of alternative dynamical programs and functions. This includes dynamically reconfiguring between states, and selecting and stabilizing emergent behaviors that do not correspond to attractors, and are hence unstable in the uncontrolled system. Our results provide a roadmap to leverage optical control methods to rationally design structure, dynamics, and function in a wide variety of active materials.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation, Capillarity, and Odd Surface Flows in Chiral Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active phase separations evade canonical thermodynamic descriptions and have thus challenged our understanding of coexistence and interfacial phenomena. Considerable progress has been made towards a non-equilibrium theoretical description of these traditionally thermodynamic concepts. Spatial parity symmetry is conspicuously assumed in much of this progress, despite the ubiquity of chirality in experimentally realized systems. In this Letter, we derive a theory for the phase coexistence and interfacial fluctuations of a system which microscopically violates spatial parity. We find suppression of the phase separation as chirality is increased as well as the development of steady-state currents tangential to the interface dividing the phases. These odd flows are irrelevant to stationary interfacial properties, with stability, capillary fluctuations, and surface area minimization determined entirely by the capillary surface tension. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations, we find excellent agreement with our theoretical scaling predictions.</description>

      <title>Controlling assembly and oscillations of elastic membranes with an active fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the chaotic flows generated by a microtubule-based active fluid to assemble self-binding actin filaments into a thin elastic sheets. Starting from a uniformly dispersed state, active flows drive the motion of actin filaments, inducing their bundling and formation of bundle-bundle connections that ultimately generate an elastic network. The emerging network separates from the active fluid to form a thin elastic sheets suspended at the sample midplane. At intermediate times, the active fluid drives large in-plane and out-of-plane deformations of the elastic sheet which are driven by low-energy bending modes. Self-organized sheets eventually exhibit centimeter-sized global spontaneous oscillations and traveling waves, despite being isotropically driven on micron lengths by the active fluid. The active assembly generates diverse network structures which are not easily realizable with conventional paradigms of equilibrium self-assembly and materials processing. Self-organized mechanical sheets pose a challenge for understanding of how a hierarchy of structure, mechanics, and dynamics emerges from a largely structureless initial suspension of active and passive microscopic components.</description>

      <title>Efficient Simulation of Deformable Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a two dimensional deformation model to describe how soft squishy circular particles respond to external forces and collisions. This model involves formulating mathematical equations and algorithms for the shape of a deformed particle based on the geometrical as well as physical properties of the particles, such as their size and elasticity. The model also accounts for the conservation of energy associated with the particle shape during interaction with other particles as well as with rigid walls. To verify the accuracy of the shape of the deformed particles, we start with a single deformable particle in an overcompressed box which we compare with the numerically simulated deformable polygon (DP) model. Then we extend our method to a jammed packing of deformable particles which we also verify through the DP model. We also provide a protocol to calculate the total force acting on such deformable particles solely based on their deformation and to obtain both athermal jammed packings as well as packings in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Phase behavior of symmetric diblock copolymers under 3D soft confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase behavior of symmetric diblock copolymers under three-dimensional (3D) soft confinement is investigated using the self-consistent field theory. The soft confinement is realized in binary blends composed AB diblock copolymers and C homopolymers, where the copolymers self-assemble to form a droplet embedded in the homopolymer matrix. The phase behavior of the confined block copolymers is regulated by the degree of confinement and the selectivity of the homopolymers, resulting in a rich variety of novel structures. When the C homopolymers are neutral to the A- and B-blocks, stacked lamellae (SL) are formed where the number of layers increases with the droplet volume, resulting in a morphological transition sequence from Janus particle to square SL. When the C homopolymers are strongly selective to the B-blocks, a series of non-lamellar morphologies, including onion-, hamburger-, cross-, ring-, and cookie-like structures, are observed. A detailed free energy analysis reveals a first-order reversible transformation between SL and onion-like (OL) structures when the selectivity of the homopolymers is changed. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of how various factors, such as the copolymer concentration, homopolymer chain length, degree of confinement, homopolymer selectivity, affect the self-assembled structures of diblock copolymers under soft 3D confinement.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity, and despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this Letter, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate its emergence in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Transients in shear thickening suspensions: when hydrodynamics matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using particle-based numerical simulations performed under pressure-imposed conditions, we investigate the transient dilation dynamics of a shear thickening suspension brought to shear jamming. We show that the stress levels, instead of diverging as predicted by steady state flow rules, remain finite and are entirely determined by the coupling between the particle network dilation and the resulting Darcy backflow. System-spanning stress gradients along the dilation direction lead to cross-system stress differences scaling quadratically with the system size. Measured stress levels are quantitatively captured by a continuum model based on a Reynolds-like dilatancy law and the Wyart-Cates constitutive model. Beyond globally jammed suspensions, our results enable the modeling of inhomogeneous flows where shear jamming is local, e.g. under impact, which eludes usual shear thickening rheological laws.</description>

      <title>Fragile-to-strong glass transition in two-dimensional vortex liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fragile-to-strong glass transition is a fascinating phenomenon that still presents many theoretical and experimental challenges. A major one is how to tune the fragility of a glass-forming liquid. Here, we study a two-dimensional (2D) system composed of vortices in a superconducting film, which effectively behaves as a 2D glass-forming liquid. We show that the kinetic fragility in this system can be experimentally varied by tuning a single parameter: the external magnetic field $H$ applied transversely to the film. This conclusion is supported by the direct comparison between the analysis of experimental measurements in an amorphous MoGe superconducting film and Monte Carlo simulations in a disordered XY model, that captures the universality class of the two-step melting transition. We show that by increasing disorder strength a fragile-to-strong transition is induced, in close similarity with the experimental findings in a magnetic field. Our numerical results shed light on the evolution of the dynamical heterogeneity from a fragile to strong glass, as due to the subtle interplay between caging effects arising from hexatic order and strong random pinning.</description>

      <title>Allosteric communication mediated by protein contact clusters: A dynamical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allostery refers to the puzzling phenomenon of long-range communication between distant sites in proteins. Despite its importance in biomolecular regulation and signal transduction, the underlying dynamical process is not well understood. This study introduces a dynamical model of allosteric communication based on "contact clusters"-localized groups of highly correlated contacts that facilitate interactions between secondary structures. The model shows that allostery involves a multi-step process with cooperative contact changes within clusters and communication between distant clusters mediated by rigid secondary structures. Considering time-dependent experiments on a photoswitchable PDZ3 domain, extensive (in total $\sim 500\,\mu$s) molecular dynamics simulations are conducted that directly monitor the photoinduced allosteric transition. The structural reorganization is illustrated by the time evolution of the contact clusters and the ligand, which affects the nonlocal coupling between distant clusters. A timescale analysis reveals dynamics from nano- to microseconds, which are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured timescales.</description>

      <title>A statistical analysis of the first stages of freezing and melting of Lennard-Jones particles: Number and size distributions of transient nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The freezing/melting transition is at the heart of many natural and industrial processes. In the classical picture, the transition proceeds via the nucleation of the new phase, which has to overcome a barrier associated to the free energy cost of the growing nucleus. The total nucleation rate is also influenced by a kinetic factor which somehow depends on the number of attempts to create a nucleus, that translates into a significant density of proto-nuclei in the system. These transient tiny nuclei are not accessible to experiments, but they can be observed in molecular simulations, and their number and size distributions can be acquired and analysed. The number distributions are carefully characterized as a function of the system size, showing the expected behavior, with limited spurious effects due to the finite simulation box. It is also shown that the proto-nuclei do exist even in the stable phase, in agreement with the fact that the (unfavorable) volume contribution to their free energy is negligible in the first stages of nucleation. Moreover, the number and size distributions evolve continuously between the stable and the metastable phases, in particular when crossing the coexistence temperature. The size distributions associated to \textit{any} nucleus and to the \textit{largest} one have also been calculated, and their relationship recently established for bubbles in a liquid [J. Puibasset, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 191102 (2022)] has been shown to apply here. This is an important relation for free energy barrier calculations with biased molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of metachronal waves in a chain of symmetrically beating filaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that metachronal waves (MCWs) can emerge from a chain of symmetrically beating nematodes aligned at the edge of sessile droplets. Our study, employing a coupled elastohydrodynamic model of active filaments, elucidates that a misalignment caused by a tilt against the bounding wall disrupts the synchronization and generates a constant time lag between adjacent filaments, giving rise to MCWs. The MCWs, enhancing the fluid circulation, achieve their maximum thermodynamic efficiency over the same range of tilt angles observed in the nematode experiments.</description>

      <title>Closure to the PRISM equation derived from nonlinear response theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear response theory is employed to derive a closure to the polymer reference interaction site model (PRISM) equation. The closure applies to a liquid of neutral polymers at melt densities. It can be considered a molecular generalization of the mean spherical approximation (MSA) closure of Lebowitz and Percus to the atomic Ornstein-Zernike (OZ) equation, and is similar in some aspects to the reference "molecular" MSA (R-MMSA) closure of Schweizer and Yethiraj to PRISM. For a model binary blend of freely-jointed chains, the new closure predicts an unmixing critical temperature, Tc, via the susceptibility route that scales linearly with molecular weight, N, in agreement with Flory theory. Predictions for Tc of the new closure differ greatest from those of the R-MMSA at intermediate N, the latter being about 40% higher than the former there, but asymptotically at large N both theories give about the same values. For an isotopic blend of polyethylene, the new and R-MMSA closures predict a Tc about 25% higher than the experimental value, which is only moderately less accurate than the prediction of atomic OZ-MSA theory for Tc of methane. In this way, the derivation and its consequences help to identify the ingredients in a theory needed to model properly the equilibrium properties of a polymeric liquid at both short and long lengthscales.</description>
