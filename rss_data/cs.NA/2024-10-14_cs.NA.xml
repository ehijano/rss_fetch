      <title>Testing GPU Numerics: Finding Numerical Differences Between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As scientific codes are ported between GPU platforms, continuous testing is required to ensure numerical robustness and identify numerical differences. Compiler-induced numerical differences occur when a program is compiled and run on different GPUs, and the numerical outcomes are different for the same input. We present a study of compiler-induced numerical differences between NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. Our approach uses Varity to generate thousands of short numerical tests in CUDA and HIP, and their inputs; then, we use differential testing to check if the program produced a numerical inconsistency when run on these GPUs. We also use the HIPIFY tool to convert CUDA tests into HIP and check if there are numerical inconsistencies induced by HIPIFY. We generated more than 600,000 tests and found subtle numerical differences that come from (1) math library calls, (2) differences in floating-point precision (FP64 versus FP32), and (3) converting code with HIPIFY.</description>

      <title>Boundary corrections for kernel approximation to differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel-based approach to operator approximation for partial differential equations has been shown to be unconditionally stable for linear PDEs and numerically exhibit unconditional stability for non-linear PDEs. These methods have the same computational cost as an explicit finite difference scheme but can exhibit order reduction at boundaries. In previous work on periodic domains, [8,9], order reduction was addressed, yielding high-order accuracy. The issue addressed in this work is the elimination of order reduction of the kernel-based approach for a more general set of boundary conditions. Further, we consider the case of both first and second order operators. To demonstrate the theory, we provide not only the mathematical proofs but also experimental results by applying various boundary conditions to different types of equations. The results agree with the theory, demonstrating a systematic path to high order for kernel-based methods on bounded domains.</description>

      <title>An independent evaluation of the Famine Early Warning Systems Network food security projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reports from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) serve as the benchmark for food security predictions which is crucial for stakeholders in planning interventions and support people in need. This paper assesses the predictive accuracy of FEWSNET's food security forecasting, by comparing predictions to the following ground truth assessments at the administrative boundaries-livelihood level, revealing an overall high accuracy of 78\% across diverse timeframes and locations. However, our analysis also shows significant variations in performance across distinct regions and prediction periods. Therefore, our analysis sheds light on strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in the context of food security predictions. The insights derived from this study not only enhance our understanding of FEWSNET's capabilities but also emphasize the importance of continuous refinement in forecasting methodologies.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic error analysis of CholeskyQR based on columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CholeskyQR-type algorithms are very popular in both academia and industry in recent years. It could make a balance between the computational cost, accuracy and speed. CholeskyQR2 provides numerical stability of orthogonality and Shifted CholeskyQR3 deals with problems regarding ill-conditioned matrices. 3C algorithm is applicable for sparse matrices. However, the overestimation of the error matrices in the previous works influences the sufficient conditions for these algorithms. Particularly, it leads to a conservative shifted item in Shifted CholeskyQR3 and 3C, which may greatly influence the properties of the algorithms. In this work, we consider the randomized methods and utilize the model of probabilistic error analysis in \cite{New} to do rounding error analysis for CholeskyQR-type algorithms. We combine the theoretical analysis with the $g$-norm defined in \cite{Columns}. Our analysis could provide a smaller shifted item for Shifted CholeskyQR3 and could improve the orthogonality of our 3C algorithm for dense matrices. Numerical experiments in the final section shows that our improvements with randomized methods do have some advantages compared with the original algorithms.</description>

      <title>Greedy Trial Subspace Selection in Meshfree Time-Stepping Scheme with Applications in Coupled Bulk-Surface Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining kernel-based collocation methods with time-stepping methods to solve parabolic partial differential equations can potentially introduce challenges in balancing temporal and spatial discretization errors. Typically, using kernels with high orders of smoothness on some sufficiently dense set of trial centers provides high spatial approximation accuracy that can exceed the accuracy of finite difference methods in time. The paper proposes a greedy approach for selecting trial subspaces in the kernel-based collocation method applied to time-stepping to balance errors in both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned scenarios. The approach involves selecting trial centers using a fast block-greedy algorithm with new stopping criteria that aim to balance temporal and spatial errors. Numerical simulations of coupled bulk-surface pattern formations, a system involving two functions in the domain and two on the boundary, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reducing trial space dimensions while maintaining accuracy.</description>

      <title>Behaviour Preserving Extensions of Univariate and Bivariate Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given function values on a domain $D_0$, possibly with noise, we examine the possibility of extending the function to a larger domain $D$, $D_0\subset D$. In addition to smoothness at the boundary of $D_0$, the extension on $D\setminus D_0$ should also inherit behavioral trends of the function on $D_0$, such as growth and decay or even oscillations. The approach chosen here is based upon the framework of linear models, univariate or bivariate, with constant or varying coefficients.</description>

      <title>Multigrid methods for the Stokes problem on GPU systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a matrix-free multigrid method for solving the Stokes problem, discretized using $H^{\text{div}}$-conforming discontinuous Galerkin methods. We employ a Schur complement method combined with the fast diagonalization method for the efficient evaluation of the local solver within the multiplicative Schwarz smoother. This approach operates directly on both the velocity and pressure spaces, eliminating the need for a global Schur complement approximation. By leveraging the tensor product structure of Raviart-Thomas elements and an optimized, conflict-free shared memory access pattern, the matrix-free operator evaluation demonstrates excellent performance numbers, reaching over one billion degrees of freedom per second on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. Numerical results indicate efficiency comparable to that of the three-dimensional Poisson problem.</description>

      <title>Lower order mixed elements for the linear elasticity problem in 2D and 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct two lower order mixed elements for the linear elasticity problem in the Hellinger-Reissner formulation, one for the 2D problem and one for the 3D problem, both on macro-element meshes. The discrete stress spaces enrich the analogous $P_k$ stress spaces in [J. Hu and S. Zhang, arxiv, 2014, J. Hu and S. Zhang, Sci. China Math., 2015] with simple macro-element bubble functions, and the discrete displacement spaces are discontinuous piecewise $P_{k-1}$ polynomial spaces, with $k=2,3$, respectively. Discrete stability and optimal convergence is proved by using the macro-element technique. As a byproduct, the discrete stability and optimal convergence of the $P_2-P_1$ mixed element in [L. Chen and X. Huang, SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 2022] in 3D is proved on another macro-element mesh. For the mixed element in 2D, an $H^2$-conforming composite element is constructed and an exact discrete elasticity sequence is presented. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive higher order reversible integrators for memory efficient deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The depth of networks plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of deep learning. However, the memory requirement for backpropagation scales linearly with the number of layers, which leads to memory bottlenecks during training. Moreover, deep networks are often unable to handle time-series appearing at irregular intervals. These issues can be resolved by considering continuous-depth networks based on the neural ODE framework in combination with reversible integration methods that allow for variable time-steps. Reversibility of the method ensures that the memory requirement for training is independent of network depth, while variable time-steps are required for assimilating time-series data on irregular intervals. However, at present, there are no known higher-order reversible methods with this property. High-order methods are especially important when a high level of accuracy in learning is required or when small time-steps are necessary due to large errors in time integration of neural ODEs, for instance in context of complex dynamical systems such as Kepler systems and molecular dynamics. The requirement of small time-steps when using a low-order method can significantly increase the computational cost of training as well as inference. In this work, we present an approach for constructing high-order reversible methods that allow adaptive time-stepping. Our numerical tests show both the advantages in computational speed and improved training accuracy of the new networks when applied to the task of learning dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A forward scheme with machine learning for forward-backward SDEs with jumps by decoupling jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) have been generalized by introducing jumps for better capturing random phenomena, while the resulting FBSDEs are far more intricate than the standard one from every perspective. In this work, we establish a forward scheme for potentially high-dimensional FBSDEs with jumps, taking a similar approach to [Bender and Denk, 117 (2007), Stoch. Process. Their Appl., pp.1793-1812], with the aid of machine learning techniques for implementation. The developed forward scheme is built upon a recursive representation that decouples random jumps at every step and converges exponentially fast to the original FBSDE with jumps, often requiring only a few iterations to achieve sufficient accuracy, along with the error bound vanishing for lower jump intensities. The established framework also holds novelty in its neural network-based implementation of a wide class of forward schemes for FBSDEs, notably whether with or without jumps. We provide an extensive collection of numerical results, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed recursion and its corresponding forward scheme in approximating high-dimensional FBSDEs with jumps (up to 100-dimension) without directly handling the random jumps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on decoupled finite element methods for the fourth-order exterior differential equation. Based on differential complexes and the Helmholtz decomposition, the fourth-order exterior differential equation is decomposed into two second-order exterior differential equations and one generalized Stokes equation. A family of conforming finite element methods are developed for the decoupled formulation. Numerical results are provided for verifying the decoupled finite element methods of the biharmonic equation in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Singular layer PINN methods for Burgers' equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a new learning method called sl-PINN to tackle the one-dimensional viscous Burgers problem at a small viscosity, which results in a singular interior layer. To address this issue, we first determine the corrector that characterizes the unique behavior of the viscous flow within the interior layers by means of asymptotic analysis. We then use these correctors to construct sl-PINN predictions for both stationary and moving interior layer cases of the viscous Burgers problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that sl-PINNs accurately predict the solution for low viscosity, notably reducing errors near the interior layer compared to traditional PINN methods. Our proposed method offers a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of the solution near the interior layer, aiding in capturing the robust part of the training solution.</description>

      <title>A Higher-order Hybridisable Discontinuous Galerkin IMEX method for the incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The incompressible Euler equations are an important model system in computational fluid dynamics. Fast high-order methods for the solution of this time-dependent system of partial differential equations are of particular interest: due to their exponential convergence in the polynomial degree they can make efficient use of computational resources. To address this challenge we describe a novel timestepping method which combines a hybridised Discontinuous Galerkin method for the spatial discretisation with IMEX timestepping schemes, thus achieving high-order accuracy in both space and time. The computational bottleneck is the solution of a (block-) sparse linear system to compute updates to pressure and velocity at each stage of the IMEX integrator. Following Chorin's projection approach, this update of the velocity and pressure fields is split into two stages. As a result, the hybridised equation for the implicit pressure-velocity problem is reduced to the well-known system which arises in hybridised mixed formulations of the Poisson- or diffusion problem and for which efficient multigrid preconditioners have been developed. Splitting errors can be reduced systematically by embedding this update into a preconditioned Richardson iteration. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method is demonstrated numerically for two time-dependent testcases that have been previously studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>A fully-decoupled second-order-in-time and unconditionally energy stable scheme for a phase-field model of two phase flow with variable density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a second-order, fully decoupled, and energy-stable numerical scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model for two phase flow with variable density and viscosity. We propose a new decoupling Constant Scalar Auxiliary Variable (D-CSAV) method which is easy to generalize to schemes with high order accuracy in time. The method is designed using the "zero-energy-contribution" property while maintaining conservative time discretization for the "non-zero-energy-contribution" terms. Our algorithm simplifies to solving three independent linear elliptic systems per time step, two of them with constant coefficients. The update of all scalar auxiliary variables is explicit and decoupled from solving the phase field variable and velocity field. We rigorously prove unconditional energy stability of the scheme and perform extensive benchmark simulations to demonstrate accuracy and efficiency of the method.</description>

Abstract: CubeSats offer a cost-effective platform for various space missions, but their limited fuel capacity and susceptibility to environmental disturbances pose significant challenges for precise orbital maneuvering. This paper presents a novel control strategy that integrates a J2-optimized sequence with an LSTM-based low-level control layer to address these issues. The J2-optimized sequence leverages the Earth's oblateness to minimize fuel consumption during orbital corrections, while the LSTM network provides real-time adjustments to compensate for external disturbances and unmodeled dynamics. The LSTM network was trained on a dataset generated from simulated orbital scenarios, including factors such as atmospheric drag, solar radiation pressure, and gravitational perturbations. The proposed system was evaluated through numerical simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in maneuver accuracy and robustness compared to traditional methods. The results show that the combined system efficiently reduces miss distances, even under conditions of high uncertainty. This hybrid approach offers a powerful and adaptive solution for CubeSat missions, balancing fuel efficiency with precise orbital control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the Euler-Maruyama dicretization of the SDE dXt =b(t,Xt)dt+ dZt, X0 =x$\in$Rd, where Zt is a symmetric isotropic d-dimensional $\alpha$-stable process, $\alpha$ $\in$ (1, 2] and the drift b $\in$ L$\infty$ ([0,T],C$\beta$(Rd,Rd)), $\beta$ $\in$ (0,1), is bounded and H{\"o}lder regular in space. Using an Euler scheme with a randomization of the time variable, we show that, denoting $\gamma$ := $\alpha$ + $\beta$ -- 1, the weak error on densities related to this discretization converges at the rate $\gamma$/$\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Wave scattering with time-periodic coefficients: Energy estimates and harmonic formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates acoustic wave scattering from materials with periodic time-modulated material parameters. We consider the basic case of a single connected domain where absorbing or Neumann boundary conditions are enforced. Energy estimates limit the exponential growth of solutions to the initial value problem, thereby confining Floquet exponents to a complex half-space under absorbing boundary conditions and to a strip near the real axis for Neumann conditions. We introduce a system of coupled harmonics and establish a Fredholm alternative result using Riesz-Schauder theory. For a finite set of harmonics, we show that the spectrum remains discrete. Different eigenvalue formulations for the Floquet exponents are formulated and connected to these results. Employing a space discretization to the system of coupled harmonics filters spatially oscillating modes, which is shown to imply a localization result for the temporal spectrum of the fully discrete coupled harmonics. Such a localization result is the key to further analysis, since the truncation of the coupled harmonics is critically affected for non-localized modes. We use the localization result to show that, when enough harmonics are included, the approximated Floquet exponents exhibit the same limitations as their continuous counterparts. Moreover, the approximated modes are shown to satisfy the defining properties of Bloch modes, with a defect that vanishes as the number of harmonics approaches infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>ALM-PINNs Algorithms for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Parameter Inversion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the PINNs algorithm by proposing the ALM-PINNs computational framework to solve various nonlinear partial differential equations and corresponding parameters identification problems. The numerical solutions obtained by the ALM-PINNs algorithm are compared with both the exact solutions and the numerical solutions implemented from the PINNs algorithm. This demonstrates that under the same machine learning framework (TensorFlow 2.0) and neural network architecture, the ALM-PINNs algorithm achieves higher accuracy compared to the standard PINNs algorithm. Additionally, this paper systematically analyzes the construction principles of the loss function by introducing the probability distribution of random errors as prior information, and provides a theoretical basis for algorithm improvement.</description>

      <title>SLERP-TVDRK (STVDRK) Methods for Ordinary Differential Equations on Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We mimic the conventional explicit Total Variation Diminishing Runge-Kutta (TVDRK) schemes and propose a class of numerical integrators to solve differential equations on a unit sphere. Our approach utilizes the exponential map inherent to the sphere and employs spherical linear interpolation (SLERP). These modified schemes, named SLERP-TVDRK methods or STVDRK, offer improved accuracy compared to typical projective RK methods. Furthermore, they eliminate the need for any projection and provide a straightforward implementation. While we have successfully constructed STVDRK schemes only up to third-order accuracy, we explain the challenges in deriving STVDRK-r for r \ge 4. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we will demonstrate its application in solving the eikonal equation on the unit sphere and simulating p-harmonic flows using our proposed method.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Dimensional Mathematical Model for Surface Exerted Point Forces in Elastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some phenotypes of biological cells exert mechanical forces on their direct environment during their development and progression. In this paper the impact of cellular forces on the surrounding tissue is considered. Assuming the size of the cell to be much smaller than that of the computational domain, and assuming small displacements, linear elasticity (Hooke's Law) with point forces described by Dirac delta distributions is used in momentum balance equation. Due to the singular nature of the Dirac delta distribution, the solution does not lie in the classical $H^1$ finite element space for multi-dimensional domains. We analyze the $L^2$-convergence of forces in a superposition of line segments across the cell boundary to an integral representation of the forces on the cell boundary. It is proved that the $L^2$-convergence of the displacement field away from the cell boundary matches the quadratic order of convergence of the midpoint rule on the forces that are exerted on the curve or surface that describes the cell boundary.</description>

      <title>An efficient numerical method for American options and their Greeks under the two-asset Kou jump-diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the numerical solution of the two-dimensional time-dependent partial integro-differential complementarity problem (PIDCP) that holds for the value of American-style options under the two-asset Kou jump-diffusion model. Following the method of lines (MOL), we derive an efficient numerical method for the pertinent PIDCP. Here, for the discretization of the nonlocal double integral term, an extension is employed of the fast algorithm by Toivanen (2008) in the case of the one-asset Kou jump-diffusion model. For the temporal discretization, we study a useful family of second-order diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods. Their adaptation to the semidiscrete two-dimensional Kou PIDCP is obtained by means of an effective iteration introduced by d'Halluin, Forsyth &amp; Labahn (2004) and d'Halluin, Forsyth &amp; Vetzal (2005).
  Ample numerical experiments are presented showing that the proposed numerical method achieves a favourable, second-order convergence behaviour to the American two-asset option value as well as to its Greeks Delta and Gamma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study monotone finite difference approximations for a broad class of reaction-diffusion problems, incorporating general symmetric L\'evy operators. By employing an adaptive time-stepping discretization, we derive the discrete Fujita critical exponent for these problems. Additionally, under general consistency assumptions, we establish the convergence of discrete blow-up times to their continuous counterparts. As complementary results, we also present the asymptotic-in-time behavior of discrete heat-type equations as well as an extensive analysis of discrete eigenvalue problems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Rounding 2.0, with a View towards Complexity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Rounding is a probabilistic rounding mode that is surprisingly effective in large-scale computations and low-precision arithmetic. Its random nature promotes error cancellation rather than error accumulation, resulting in slower growth of roundoff errors as the problem size increases, especially when compared to traditional deterministic rounding methods, such as rounding-to-nearest. We advocate for SR as a foundational tool in the complexity analysis of algorithms, and suggest several research directions.</description>

      <title>A geometry aware arbitrary order collocation Boundary Element Method solver for the potential flow past three dimensional lifting surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a numerical model for the simulation of potential flow past three dimensional lifting surfaces. The solver is based on the collocation Boundary Element Method, combined with Galerkin variational formulation of the nonlinear Kutta condition imposed at the trailing edge. A similar Galerkin variational formulation is also used for the computation of the fluid velocity at the wake collocation points, required by the relaxation algorithm which aligns the wake with the local flow. The use of such a technique, typically associated with the Finite Element Method, allows in fact for the evaluation of the solution derivatives in a way that is independent of the local grid topology. As a result of this choice, combined with the direct interface with CAD surfaces, the solver is able to use arbitrary order Lagrangian elements on automatically refined grids. Numerical results on a rectangular wing with NACA 0012 airfoil sections are presented to compare the accuracy improvements obtained by grid spatial refinement or by discretization degree increase. Finally, numerical results on rectangular and swept wings with NACA 0012 airfoil section confirm that the model is able to reproduce experimental data with good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.</description>

      <title>Fast Data-independent KLT Approximations Based on Integer Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Karhunen-Lo\`eve transform (KLT) stands as a well-established discrete transform, demonstrating optimal characteristics in data decorrelation and dimensionality reduction. Its ability to condense energy compression into a select few main components has rendered it instrumental in various applications within image compression frameworks. However, computing the KLT depends on the covariance matrix of the input data, which makes it difficult to develop fast algorithms for its implementation. Approximations for the KLT, utilizing specific rounding functions, have been introduced to reduce its computational complexity. Therefore, our paper introduces a category of low-complexity, data-independent KLT approximations, employing a range of round-off functions. The design methodology of the approximate transform is defined for any block-length $N$, but emphasis is given to transforms of $N = 8$ due to its wide use in image and video compression. The proposed transforms perform well when compared to the exact KLT and approximations considering classical performance measures. For particular scenarios, our proposed transforms demonstrated superior performance when compared to KLT approximations documented in the literature. We also developed fast algorithms for the proposed transforms, further reducing the arithmetic cost associated with their implementation. Evaluation of field programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware implementation metrics was conducted. Practical applications in image encoding showed the relevance of the proposed transforms. In fact, we showed that one of the proposed transforms outperformed the exact KLT given certain compression ratios.</description>

      <title>Anderson Acceleration in Nonsmooth Problems: Local Convergence via Active Manifold Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anderson acceleration is an effective technique for enhancing the efficiency of fixed-point iterations; however, analyzing its convergence in nonsmooth settings presents significant challenges. In this paper, we investigate a class of nonsmooth optimization algorithms characterized by the active manifold identification property. This class includes a diverse array of methods such as the proximal point method, proximal gradient method, proximal linear method, proximal coordinate descent method, Douglas-Rachford splitting (or the alternating direction method of multipliers), and the iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ method, among others. Under the assumption that the optimization problem possesses an active manifold at a stationary point, we establish a local R-linear convergence rate for the Anderson-accelerated algorithm. Our extensive numerical experiments further highlight the robust performance of the proposed Anderson-accelerated methods.</description>

      <title>Combined WENO schemes for increasing the accuracy of the numerical solution of conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new method which allows utilizing all the available sub-stencils of a WENO scheme to increase the accuracy of the numerical solution of conservation laws while preserving the non-oscillatory property of the scheme. In this method, near a discontinuity, if there is a smooth sub-stencil with higher-order of accuracy, it is used in the reconstruction procedure. Furthermore, in smooth regions, all the sub-stencils of the same order of accuracy form the stencil with the highest order of accuracy as the conventional WENO scheme. The presented method is assessed using several test cases of the linear wave equation and one- and two-dimensional Euler's equations of gas dynamics. In addition to the original weights of WENO schemes, the WENO-Z approach is used. The results show that the new method increases the accuracy of the results while properly maintaining the ENO property.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging Systems: The Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography (qPACT) is an emerging medical imaging modality that carries the promise of high-contrast, fine-resolution imaging of clinically relevant quantities like hemoglobin concentration and blood-oxygen saturation. However, qPACT image reconstruction is governed by a multiphysics, partial differential equation (PDE) based inverse problem that is highly non-linear and severely ill-posed. Compounding the difficulty of the problem is the lack of established design standards for qPACT imaging systems, as there is currently a proliferation of qPACT system designs for various applications and it is unknown which ones are optimal or how to best modify the systems under various design constraints. This work introduces a novel computational approach for the optimal experimental design (OED) of qPACT imaging systems based on the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Our approach incorporates several techniques to address challenges associated with forming the bound in the infinite-dimensional function space setting of qPACT, including priors with trace-class covariance operators and the use of the variational adjoint method to compute derivatives of the log-likelihood function needed in the bound computation. The resulting Bayesian CRB based design metric is computationally efficient and independent of the choice of estimator used to solve the inverse problem. The efficacy of the bound in guiding experimental design was demonstrated in a numerical study of qPACT design schemes under a stylized two-dimensional imaging geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose Bayesian CRB based design for systems governed by PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the Hughes phenomenon, the major challenges encountered in computations with learning models comes from the scale of complexity, e.g. the so-called curse of dimensionality. There are various approaches for accelerate learning computations with minimal loss of accuracy. These approaches range from model-level to implementation-level approaches. To the best of our knowledge, the first one is rarely used in its basic form. Perhaps, this is due to theoretical understanding of mathematical insights of model decomposition approaches, and thus the ability of developing mathematical improvements has lagged behind. We describe a model-level decomposition approach that combines both the decomposition of the operators and the decomposition of the network. We perform a feasibility analysis on the resulting algorithm, both in terms of its accuracy and scalability.</description>

      <title>Robust identifiability for symbolic recovery of differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning have transformed the discovery of physical laws, moving from manual derivation to data-driven methods that simultaneously learn both the structure and parameters of governing equations. This shift introduces new challenges regarding the validity of the discovered equations, particularly concerning their uniqueness and, hence, identifiability. While the issue of non-uniqueness has been well-studied in the context of parameter estimation, it remains underexplored for algorithms that recover both structure and parameters simultaneously. Early studies have primarily focused on idealized scenarios with perfect, noise-free data. In contrast, this paper investigates how noise influences the uniqueness and identifiability of physical laws governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We develop a comprehensive mathematical framework to analyze the uniqueness of PDEs in the presence of noise and introduce new algorithms that account for noise, providing thresholds to assess uniqueness and identifying situations where excessive noise hinders reliable conclusions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms in detecting uniqueness despite the presence of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on a family of nonlinear continuity equations for the evolution of a non-negative density $\rho$ with a continuous and compactly supported nonlinear mobility $\mathrm{m}(\rho)$ not necessarily concave. The velocity field is the negative gradient of the variation of a free energy including internal and confinement energy terms. Problems with compactly supported mobility are often called saturation problems since the values of the density are constrained below a maximal value. Taking advantage of a family of approximating problems, we show the existence of $C_0$-semigroups of $L^1$ contractions. We study the $\omega$-limit of the problem, its most relevant properties, and the appearance of free boundaries in the long-time behaviour. This problem has a formal gradient-flow structure, and we discuss the local/global minimisers of the corresponding free energy in the natural topology related to the set of initial data for the $L^\infty$-constrained gradient flow of probability densities. Furthermore, we analyse a structure preserving implicit finite-volume scheme and discuss its convergence and long-time behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical simulation of a quantum electron confined in a 10 nm potential well, using the Crank-Nicolson numerical technique to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The results capture the evolution of the electron's wave function at the 2000th time step, illustrating distinct standing wave patterns and probability densities that align with quantum mechanical predictions. Additionally, both 2D and 3D simulations across multiple time steps reveal the dynamic nature of quantum superposition and interference within the well. These findings highlight the method's stability and accuracy, offering a valuable tool for exploring quantum phenomena in constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the generation and propagation of oscillatory solutions observed in the widely used Lorenz 96 (L96) systems. First, period-two oscillations between adjacent grid points are found in the leading-order expansions of the discrete L96 system. The evolution of the envelope of period-two oscillations is described by a set of modulation equations with strictly hyperbolic structure. The modulation equations are found to be also subject to an additional reaction term dependent on the grid size, and the period-two oscillations will break down into fully chaotic dynamics when the oscillation amplitude grows large. Then, similar oscillation solutions are analyzed in the two-layer L96 model including multiscale coupling. Modulation equations for period-three oscillations are derived based on a weakly nonlinear analysis in the transition between oscillatory and nonoscillatory regions. Detailed numerical experiments are shown to confirm the analytical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel adaptive eigenvalue filtering strategy to stabilize and accelerate the optimization of Neo-Hookean energy and its variants under the Projected Newton framework. For the first time, we show that Newton's method, Projected Newton with eigenvalue clamping and Projected Newton with absolute eigenvalue filtering can be unified using ideas from the generalized trust region method. Based on the trust-region fit, our model adaptively chooses the correct eigenvalue filtering strategy to apply during the optimization. Our method is simple but effective, requiring only two lines of code change in the existing Projected Newton framework. We validate our model outperforms stand-alone variants across a number of experiments on quasistatic simulation of deformable solids over a large dataset.</description>

Abstract: We study the strong existence and uniqueness of solutions within a Weyl chamber for a class of time-dependent particle systems driven by multiplicative noise. This class includes well-known processes in physics and mathematical finance. We propose a method to prove the existence of negative moments for the solutions. This result allows us to analyze two numerical schemes for approximating the solutions. The first scheme is a $\theta$-Euler--Maruyama scheme, which ensures that the approximated solution remains within the Weyl chamber. The second scheme is a truncated $\theta$-Euler--Maruyama scheme, which produces values in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ instead of the Weyl chamber $\mathbb{W}$, offering improved computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Kernelizable Primal-Dual Formulation of the Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to express a learning task in terms of a primal and a dual optimization problem lies at the core of a plethora of machine learning methods. For example, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Least-Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), Ridge Regression (RR), Lasso Regression (LR), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and more recently Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) have all been defined either in terms of primal weights or in terms of dual Lagrange multipliers. The primal formulation is computationally advantageous in the case of large sample size while the dual is preferred for high-dimensional data. Crucially, said learning problems can be made nonlinear through the introduction of a feature map in the primal problem, which corresponds to applying the kernel trick in the dual. In this paper we derive a primal-dual formulation of the Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition (MLSVD), which recovers as special cases both PCA and SVD. Besides enabling computational gains through the derived primal formulation, we propose a nonlinear extension of the MLSVD using feature maps, which results in a dual problem where a kernel tensor arises. We discuss potential applications in the context of signal analysis and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to global minimizers in data driven supervised deep learning: Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization provably fail to converge to global minimizers in the training of deep neural networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods - consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays key tools to solve data driven supervised learning problems. Despite the great success of SGD methods in the training of DNNs, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to explain the success and the limitations of such methods in rigorous theoretical terms. In particular, even in the standard setup of data driven supervised learning problems, it remained an open research problem to prove (or disprove) that SGD methods converge in the training of DNNs with the popular rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with high probability to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. In this work we answer this question negatively. Specifically, in this work we prove for a large class of SGD methods that the considered optimizer does with high probability not converge to global minimizers of the optimization problem. It turns out that the probability to not converge to a global minimizer converges at least exponentially quickly to one as the width of the first hidden layer of the ANN and the depth of the ANN, respectively, increase. The general non-convergence results of this work do not only apply to the plain vanilla standard SGD method but also to a large class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods such as the momentum SGD, the Nesterov accelerated SGD, the Adagrad, the RMSProp, the Adam, the Adamax, the AMSGrad, and the Nadam optimizers.</description>

While providing several counterexamples based on classical ideas as well as combinatorial Banach spaces, we discuss positive results for matrix algebras and provide an absolute constant in the case of complex $2\times2$-matrices with the induced $1$-norm. Furthermore, we discuss positive results for infinite-dimensional Banach algebras, including the Calkin algebra.</description>

      <title>High-Order Schemes of Exponential Time Differencing for Stiff Systems with Nondiagonal Linear Part</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exponential time differencing methods is a power tool for high-performance numerical simulation of computationally challenging problems in condensed matter physics, fluid dynamics, chemical and biological physics, where mathematical models often possess fast oscillating or decaying modes -- in other words, are stiff systems. Practical implementation of these methods for the systems with nondiagonal linear part of equations is exacerbated by infeasibility of an analytical calculation of the exponential of a nondiagonal linear operator; in this case, the coefficients of the exponential time differencing scheme cannot be calculated analytically. We suggest an approach, where these coefficients are numerically calculated with auxiliary problems. We rewrite the high-order Runge--Kutta type schemes in terms of the solutions to these auxiliary problems and practically examine the accuracy and computational performance of these methods for a heterogeneous Cahn--Hilliard equation, a sixth-order spatial derivative equation governing pattern formation in the presence of an additional conservation law, and a Fokker--Planck equation governing macroscopic dynamics of a network of neurons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06624v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel stepsize based on \BB method for solving some challenging optimization problems efficiently, named regularized \BB (RBB) stepsize. We indicate that RBB stepsize is the close solution to a $\ell_{2}^{2}$-regularized least squares problem. When the regularized item vanishes, the RBB stepsize reduces to the original \BB stepsize. RBB stepsize includes a class of valid stepsizes, such as another version of \BB stepsize. The global convergence of the corresponding RBB algorithm is proved in solving convex quadratic optimization problems. One scheme for adaptively generating regularization parameters was proposed, named adaptive two-step parameter. An enhanced RBB stepsize is used for solving quadratic and general optimization problems more efficiently. RBB stepsize could overcome the instability of BB stepsize in many ill-conditioned optimization problems. Moreover, RBB stepsize is more robust than BB stepsize in numerical experiments. Numerical examples show the advantage of using the proposed stepsize to solve some challenging optimization problems vividly.</description>

Abstract: The growth factor in Gaussian elimination measures how large the entries of an LU factorization can be relative to the entries of the original matrix. It is a key parameter in error estimates, and one of the most fundamental topics in numerical analysis. We produce an upper bound of $n^{0.2079 \ln n +0.91}$ for the growth factor in Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting -- the first improvement upon Wilkinson's original 1961 bound of $2 \, n ^{0.25\ln n +0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Colored-LIM: A Data-Driven Method for Studying Dynamical Systems with Temporally Correlated Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-world problems, environmental noise is often idealized as Gaussian white noise, despite potential temporal dependencies. The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that extract dynamic and stochastic information from finite time-series data of complex systems. In this study, we introduce a new variant of LIM, called Colored-LIM, which models stochasticity using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise. Despite the non-trivial correlation between observable and colored noise, we show that Colored-LIM unveils the desired information merely from the correlation function of the observable. Therefore, this approach not only accounts for the memory effects of environmental noise, traditionally represented by time-uncorrelated white noise in the Classical LIM framework, but does so using the same observation dataset without requiring additional data. Furthermore, we show that Colored-LIM does not reduce to Classical LIM in the white noise limit, underscoring the importance of temporal dependencies in stochastic systems. In this paper, we rigorously develop the Colored-LIM, explore its connections with the Classical LIM and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, and validate its effectiveness on both ideal linear and nonlinear systems. In addition, we illustrate the potential applications and implications of Colored-LIM for real-world problems, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and the electricity network of Tohoku University.</description>

Abstract: We propose a two-scale neural network method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with small parameters using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We directly incorporate the small parameters into the architecture of neural networks. The proposed method enables solving PDEs with small parameters in a simple fashion, without adding Fourier features or other computationally taxing searches of truncation parameters. Various numerical examples demonstrate reasonable accuracy in capturing features of large derivatives in the solutions caused by small parameters.</description>

      <title>Straggler-tolerant stationary methods for linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the iterative solution of linear algebraic equations under the condition that matrix-vector products with the coefficient matrix are computed only partially. At the same time, non-computed entries are set to zeros. We assume that both the number of computed entries and their associated row index set are random variables, with the row index set sampled uniformly given the number of computed entries. This model of computations is realized in hybrid cloud computing architectures following the controller-worker distributed model under the influence of straggling workers. We propose straggler-tolerant Richardson iteration scheme and Chebyshev semi-iterative schemes, and prove sufficient conditions for their convergence in expectation. Numerical experiments verify the presented theoretical results as well as the effectiveness of the proposed schemes on a few sparse matrix problems.</description>

      <title>Domain Decomposition-based coupling of Operator Inference reduced order models via the Schwarz alternating method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents and evaluates an approach for coupling together subdomain-local reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf) with each other and with subdomain-local full order models (FOMs), following a domain decomposition of the spatial geometry on which a given partial differential equation (PDE) is posed. Joining subdomain-local models is accomplished using the overlapping Schwarz alternating method, a minimally-intrusive multiscale coupling technique that works by transforming a monolithic problem into a sequence of subdomain-local problems, which communicate through transmission boundary conditions imposed on the subdomain interfaces. After formulating the overlapping Schwarz alternating method for OpInf ROMs, termed OpInf-Schwarz, we evaluate the method's accuracy and efficiency on several test cases involving the heat equation in two spatial dimensions. We demonstrate that the method is capable of coupling together arbitrary combinations of OpInf ROMs and FOMs, and that speed-ups over a monolithic FOM are possible when performing OpInf ROM coupling.</description>

      <title>A robust solver for large-scale heat transfer topology optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06850v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a large-scale parallel solver, specifically designed to tackle the challenges of solving high-dimensional and high-contrast linear systems in heat transfer topology optimization. The solver incorporates an interpolation technique to accelerate convergence in high-resolution domains, along with a multiscale multigrid preconditioner to handle complex coefficient fields with significant contrast. All modules of the optimization solver are implemented on a high performance computing cluster by the PETSc numerical library. Through a series of numerical investigations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing convergence and robustness during the optimization process, particularly in high-contrast scenarios with resolutions up to $1024^3$. Our performance results indicate that the proposed preconditioner achieves over $2\times$ speedup against the default algebraic multigrid in PETSc for high-contrast cases.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware training of factorized layers in tensor Tucker format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reducing parameter redundancies in neural network architectures is crucial for achieving feasible computational and memory requirements during training and inference phases. Given its easy implementation and flexibility, one promising approach is layer factorization, which reshapes weight tensors into a matrix format and parameterizes them as the product of two small rank matrices. However, this approach typically requires an initial full-model warm-up phase, prior knowledge of a feasible rank, and it is sensitive to parameter initialization. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to train the factors of a Tucker decomposition of the weight tensors. Our training proposal proves to be optimal in locally approximating the original unfactorized dynamics independently of the initialization. Furthermore, the rank of each mode is dynamically updated during training. We provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm, showing convergence, approximation and local descent guarantees. The method's performance is further illustrated through a variety of experiments, showing remarkable training compression rates and comparable or even better performance than the full baseline and alternative layer factorization strategies.</description>

      <title>Weighted variation spaces and approximation by shallow ReLU networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the approximation of functions $f$ on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ by the outputs of single-hidden-layer ReLU neural networks of width $n$. This form of nonlinear $n$-term dictionary approximation has been intensely studied since it is the simplest case of neural network approximation (NNA). There are several celebrated approximation results for this form of NNA that introduce novel model classes of functions on $\Omega$ whose approximation rates do not grow unbounded with the input dimension. These novel classes include Barron classes, and classes based on sparsity or variation such as the Radon-domain BV classes. The present paper is concerned with the definition of these novel model classes on domains $\Omega$. The current definition of these model classes does not depend on the domain $\Omega$. A new and more proper definition of model classes on domains is given by introducing the concept of weighted variation spaces. These new model classes are intrinsic to the domain itself. The importance of these new model classes is that they are strictly larger than the classical (domain-independent) classes. Yet, it is shown that they maintain the same NNA rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sequence of entropy numbers quantifies the degree of compactness of a linear operator acting between quasi-Banach spaces. We determine the asymptotic behavior of entropy numbers in the case of natural embeddings between finite-dimensional Lorentz spaces $\ell_{p,q}^n$ in all regimes; our results are sharp up to constants. This generalizes classical results obtained by Sch\"utt (in the case of Banach spaces) and Edmunds and Triebel, K\"uhn, as well as Gu\'edon and Litvak (in the case of quasi-Banach spaces) for entropy numbers of identities between finte-dimensional Lebesgue sequence spaces $\ell_p^n$. We employ techniques such as interpolation, volume comparison as well as techniques from sparse approximation and combinatorial arguments. Further, we characterize entropy numbers of embeddings between finite-dimensional symmetric quasi-Banach spaces in terms of best $s$-term approximation numbers.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian surrogate modelling with application to robust design optimisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate models provide a quick-to-evaluate approximation to complex computational models and are essential for multi-query problems like design optimisation. The inputs of current deterministic computational models are usually high-dimensional and uncertain. We consider Bayesian inference for constructing statistical surrogates with input uncertainties and intrinsic dimensionality reduction. The surrogate is trained by fitting to data obtained from a deterministic computational model. The assumed prior probability density of the surrogate is a Gaussian process. We determine the respective posterior probability density and parameters of the posited statistical model using variational Bayes. The non-Gaussian posterior is approximated by a Gaussian trial density with free variational parameters and the discrepancy between them is measured using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. We employ the stochastic gradient method to compute the variational parameters and other statistical model parameters by minimising the KL divergence. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of the proposed reduced dimension variational Gaussian process (RDVGP) surrogate on illustrative and robust structural optimisation problems where cost functions depend on a weighted sum of the mean and standard deviation of model outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric statistical inference on a periodic interaction potential $W$ from noisy discrete space-time measurements of solutions $\rho=\rho_W$ of the nonlinear McKean-Vlasov equation, describing the probability density of the mean field limit of an interacting particle system. We show how Gaussian process priors assigned to $W$ give rise to posterior mean estimators that exhibit fast convergence rates for the implied estimated densities $\bar \rho$ towards $\rho_W$. We further show that if the initial condition $\phi$ is not too smooth and satisfies a standard deconvolvability condition, then one can consistently infer Sobolev-regular potentials $W$ at convergence rates $N^{-\theta}$ for appropriate $\theta&gt;0$, where $N$ is the number of measurements. The exponent $\theta$ can be taken to approach $1/2$ as the regularity of $W$ increases corresponding to `near-parametric' models.</description>

      <title>High-order discontinuous Galerkin schemes with subcell finite volume limiter and adaptive mesh refinement for a monolithic first-order BSSNOK formulation of the Einstein-Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a high order discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme with subcell finite volume (FV) limiter to solve a monolithic first--order hyperbolic BSSNOK formulation of the coupled Einstein--Euler equations. The numerical scheme runs with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in three space dimensions, is endowed with time-accurate local time stepping (LTS) and is able to deal with both conservative and non-conservative hyperbolic systems. The system of governing partial differential equations was shown to be strongly hyperbolic and is solved in a monolithic fashion with one numerical framework that can be simultaneously applied to both the conservative matter subsystem as well as the non-conservative subsystem for the spacetime. Since high order unlimited DG schemes are well-known to produce spurious oscillations in the presence of discontinuities and singularities, our subcell finite volume limiter is crucial for the robust discretization of shock waves arising in the matter as well as for the stable treatment of puncture black holes. We test the new method on a set of classical test problems of numerical general relativity, showing good agreement with available exact or numerical reference solutions. In particular, we perform the first long term evolution of the inspiralling merger of two puncture black holes with a high order ADER-DG scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel multi-relaxation-time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) for solving the volume averaged Navier-Stokes equations (VANSE). Different from the approach given in [1], this method is rooted in the widely-adopted density equilibrium distribution, which provides possibility for simulating scenarios where fluid compressibility cannot be ignored, e.g., thermal and multiphase flows. The Chapman-Enskog analysis is presented to confirm the consistency of this scheme at macroscopic level. Some numerical experiments further demonstrate that it achieves second-order convergence and exhibits better numerical performance over previous schemes as reported [2-4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of normal forms for dispersive equations using decorated trees introduced in arXiv:2005.01649. The key tool is the arborification map which is a morphism from the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to the Shuffle Hopf algebra. It originates from Ecalle's approach to dynamical systems with singularities. This natural map has been used in many applications ranging from algebra, numerical analysis and rough paths. This connection shows that Hopf algebras also appear naturally in the context of dispersive equations and provide insights into some crucial decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the generative problem of sampling from an unknown distribution for which only a sufficiently large number of training samples are available. In this paper, we build on previous work combining Schr\"odinger bridges and Langevin dynamics. A key bottleneck of this approach is the exponential dependence of the required training samples on the dimension, $d$, of the ambient state space. We propose a localization strategy which exploits conditional independence of conditional expectation values. Localization thus replaces a single high-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problem by $d$ low-dimensional Schr\"odinger bridge problems over the available training samples. In this context, a connection to multi-head self attention transformer architectures is established. As for the original Schr\"odinger bridge sampling approach, the localized sampler is stable and geometric ergodic. The sampler also naturally extends to conditional sampling and to Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme through experiments on a Gaussian problem with increasing dimensions, on a temporal stochastic process, and on a stochastic subgrid-scale parametrization conditional sampling problem.</description>

      <title>Provable In-Context Learning of Linear Systems and Linear Elliptic PDEs with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing, powered by the transformer architecture, exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, allowing pre-trained models to adapt to downstream tasks using few-shot prompts without updating their weights. Recently, transformer-based foundation models have also emerged as versatile tools for solving scientific problems, particularly in the realm of partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the theoretical foundations of the ICL capabilities in these scientific models remain largely unexplored. This work develops a rigorous error analysis for transformer-based ICL applied to solution operators associated with a family of linear elliptic PDEs. We first demonstrate that a linear transformer, defined by a linear self-attention layer, can provably learn in-context to invert linear systems arising from the spatial discretization of PDEs. This is achieved by deriving theoretical scaling laws for the prediction risk of the proposed linear transformers in terms of spatial discretization size, the number of training tasks, and the lengths of prompts used during training and inference. These scaling laws also enable us to establish quantitative error bounds for learning PDE solutions. Furthermore, we quantify the adaptability of the pre-trained transformer on downstream PDE tasks that experience distribution shifts in both tasks (represented by PDE coefficients) and input covariates (represented by the source term). To analyze task distribution shifts, we introduce a novel concept of task diversity and characterize the transformer's prediction error in terms of the magnitude of task shift, assuming sufficient diversity in the pre-training tasks. We also establish sufficient conditions to ensure task diversity. Finally, we validate the ICL-capabilities of transformers through extensive numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Variational Bayesian Inference Theory of Elasticity and Its Mixed Probabilistic Finite Element Method for Inverse Deformation Solutions in Any Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have developed a variational Bayesian inference theory of elasticity, which is accomplished by using a mixed Variational Bayesian inference Finite Element Method (VBI-FEM) that can be used to solve the inverse deformation problems of continua. In the proposed variational Bayesian inference theory of continuum mechanics, the elastic strain energy is used as a prior in a Bayesian inference network, which can intelligently recover the detailed continuum deformation mappings with only given the information on the deformed and undeformed continuum body shapes without knowing the interior deformation and the precise actual boundary conditions, both traction as well as displacement boundary conditions, and the actual material constitutive relation. Moreover, we have implemented the related finite element formulation in a computational probabilistic mechanics framework. To numerically solve mixed variational problem, we developed an operator splitting or staggered algorithm that consists of the finite element (FE) step and the Bayesian learning (BL) step as an analogue of the well-known the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. By solving the mixed probabilistic Galerkin variational problem, we demonstrated that the proposed method is able to inversely predict continuum deformation mappings with strong discontinuity or fracture without knowing the external load conditions. The proposed method provides a robust machine intelligent solution for the long-sought-after inverse problem solution, which has been a major challenge in structure failure forensic pattern analysis in past several decades. The proposed method may become a promising artificial intelligence-based inverse method for solving general partial differential equations.</description>
