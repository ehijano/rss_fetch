      <title>Toxicity Bounds for Dynamic Liquidation Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a slippage-aware toxicity condition for on-chain liquidations executed via a constant-product automated market maker (CP-AMM). For a fixed (constant) liquidation incentive $i$, the familiar toxicity frontier $\nu &lt; 1/(1+i)$ tightens to $\nu &lt; 1/((1+i)\lambda)$ for a liquidity penalty factor $\lambda$ that we derive for both the CP-AMM and a generalised form. Using a dynamic health-linked liquidation incentive $i(h) = i(1 - h)$, we obtain a state-dependent bound and, at the liquidation boundary, a liquidity-depth-only condition $\nu &lt; 1/\lambda$. This reconciles dynamic incentives with the impact of the CP-AMM price and clarifies when dynamic liquidation incentives reduce versus exacerbate spiral risk.</description>

      <title>A Risk Mitigation Model of Monetary Ecosystem with Stablecoins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins have emerged as a significant component of global financial infrastructure, with aggregate market capitalization surpassing USD250 billion in 2025. Their increasing integration into payment and settlement systems has simultaneously introduced novel channels of systemic exposure, particularly liquidity risk during periods of market stress. This study develops a hybrid monetary architecture that embeds fiat-backed stablecoins within a central bank-anchored framework to structurally mitigate liquidity fragility. The proposed model combines 100 percent reserve backing, interoperable redemption rails, and standing liquidity facilities to guarantee instant convertibility at par. Using the 2023 SVB USDC de-peg event as a calibrated stress scenario, we demonstrate that this architecture reduces peak peg deviations, shortens stress persistence, and stabilizes redemption queues under high redemption intensity. By integrating liquidity backstops and eliminating maturity-transformation channels, the framework addresses run dynamics ex ante rather than through ad hoc intervention. These findings provide empirical and theoretical support for a hybrid stablecoin-CBDC architecture that enhances systemic resilience, preserves monetary integrity, and establishes a credible pathway for stablecoin integration into regulated financial systems.</description>

      <title>Learning the Exact SABR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan et al., whose accuracy deteriorates for high volatility, long maturities, and out-of-the-money options, admitting arbitrage. While machine learning approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation against the full spectrum of market conditions.
  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture that learns the true SABR stochastic dynamics using an unprecedented large training dataset (more than 200 million points) of interest rate Cap/Floor volatility surfaces, including very long maturities (30Y) and extreme strikes consistently with market quotations. Our dataset is obtained via high-precision unbiased Monte Carlo simulation of a special scaled shifted-SABR stochastic dynamics, which allows dimensional reduction without any loss of generality.
  Our SABR DNN provides arbitrage-free calibration of real market volatility surfaces and Caps/Floors prices for any maturity and strike with negligible computational effort and without retraining across business dates. Our results fully address the gaps in the previous machine learning SABR literature in a systematic and self-consistent way, and can be extended to cover any interest rate European options in different rate tenors and currencies, thus establishing a comprehensive functional SABR framework that can be adopted for daily trading and risk management activities.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Importance Sampling with Markov Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although stochastic models driven by latent Markov processes are widely used, the classical importance sampling methods based on the exponential tilting for these models suffers from the difficulties in computing the eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions and the plausibility of the indirect asymptotic large deviation regime for the variance of the estimator. We propose a general importance sampling framework that twists the observable and latent processes separately using a link function that directly minimizes the estimator's variance. An optimal choice of the link function is chosen within the locally asymptotically normal family. We show the logarithmic efficiency of the proposed estimator. As applications, we estimate an overflow probability under a pandemic model and the CoVaR, a measurement of the co-dependent financial systemic risk. Both applications are beyond the scope of traditional importance sampling methods due to their nonlinear features.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning with Multitype Protected Attributes: Intersectional Fairness through Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however, methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called "fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength, including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims dataset.</description>
