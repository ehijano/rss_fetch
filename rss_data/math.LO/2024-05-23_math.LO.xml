      <title>Agent-Knowledge Logic for Alternative Epistemic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epistemic logic is known as logic that captures the knowledge and beliefs of agents and has undergone various developments since Hintikka (1962). In this paper, we propose a new logic called agent-knowledge logic by multiplying the individual knowledge structure with the relationships among agents. This logic is based on the Facebook logic proposed by Seligman et al. (2011) and the Logic of Hide and Seek Game proposed by Li et al. (2021). We show that this logic can embed the epistemic logic we know well. We also discuss various sentences and inferences that this logic can express.</description>

      <title>On algebraic sums, trees and ideals in the Cantor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We work in the Cantor space $2^\omega$. The results of the paper adhere the following pattern. Let $\mathcal{I}\in \{\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}, \mathcal{M}\cap \mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}\}$ and $T$ be a perfect, uniformly perfect or Silver tree. Then for every $A\in \mathcal{I}$ there exists $T'\subseteq T$ of the same kind as $T$ such that $A+\underbrace{[T']+[T']+\dots +[T']}_{\text{n--times}}\in \mathcal{I}$ for each $n\in\omega$. We also prove weaker statements for splitting trees. For the case $\mathcal{E}$ we also provide a simple characterization of basis of $\mathcal{E}$. We use these results to prove that the algebraic sum of a generalized Luzin set and a generalized Sierpi\'nski set belongs to $u_0$ and $v_0$, provided that $\mathfrak{c}$ is a regular cardinal.</description>

      <title>On Nash-Williams' Theorem regarding sequences with finite range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous theorem of Higman states that for any well-quasi-order (wqo) $Q$ the embeddability order on finite sequences over $Q$ is also wqo. In his celebrated 1965 paper, Nash-Williams established that the same conclusion holds even for all the transfinite sequences with finite range, thus proving a far reaching generalization of Higman's theorem.
  In the present paper we show that Nash-Williams' Theorem is provable in the system $\mathsf{ATR}_0$ of second-order arithmetic, thus solving an open problem by Antonio Montalb\'an and proving the reverse-mathematical equivalence of Nash-Williams' Theorem and $\mathsf{ATR}_0$. In order to accomplish this, we establish equivalent characterization of transfinite Higman's order and an order on the cumulative hierarchy with urelements from the starting wqo $Q$, and find some new connection that can be of purely order-theoretic interest. Moreover, in this paper we present a new setup that allows us to develop the theory of $\alpha$-wqo's in a way that is formalizable within primitive-recursive set theory with urelements, in a smooth and code-free fashion.</description>

      <title>Saturation properties for compositional truth with propositional correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an open question whether compositional truth with the principle of propositional soundness ,,all arithmetical sentences which are propositional tautologies are true'' is conservative over its arithmetical base theory. In this article, we show that the principle of propositional soundness imposes some saturation-like properties on the underlying model, thus showing significant limitations to the possible conservativity proof.</description>

      <title>Free p-algebras revisited: an algebraic investigation of implication-free intuitionism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new construction of free distributive p-algebras. Our construction relies on a detailed description of completely meet-irreducible congruences, so it is purely universal algebraic. It yields a normal form theorem for p-algebra terms, simpler proofs of several existing results, as well as a complete characterisation of structurally complete varieties of p-algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups from the perspective of homological algebra. We extend to this context the type-decomposition of locally compact Polish abelian groups of Hoffmann and Spitzweck, and prove that the category $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ of pro-Lie Polish abelian groups is a thick subcategory of the category of Polish abelian groups. We completely characterize injective and projective objects in $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$. We conclude that $\mathbf{proLiePAb}$ has enough projectives but not enough injectives and homological dimension $1$. We also completely characterize injective and projective objects in the category of non-Archimedean Polish abelian groups, concluding that it has enough injectives and projectives and homological dimension $1$. Injective objects are also characterized for the categories of topological torsion Polish abelian groups and for Polish abelian topological $p$-groups, showing that these categories have enough injectives and homological dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>The Ziegler spectrum for enriched ringoids and schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ziegler spectrum for categories enriched in closed symmetric monoidal Grothendieck categories is defined and studied in this paper. It recovers the classical Ziegler spectrum of a ring. As an application, the Ziegler spectrum as well as the category of generalised quasi-coherent sheaves of a reasonable scheme is introduced and studied. It is shown that there is a closed embedding of the injective spectrum of a coherent scheme endowed with the tensor fl-topology (respectively of a noetherian scheme endowed with the dual Zariski topology) into its Ziegler spectrum. It is also shown that quasi-coherent sheaves and generalised quasi-coherent sheaves are related to each other by a recollement.</description>

      <title>Analogical proportions II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogical reasoning is the ability to detect parallels between two seemingly distant objects or situations, a fundamental human capacity used for example in commonsense reasoning, learning, and creativity which is believed by many researchers to be at the core of human and artificial general intelligence. Analogical proportions are expressions of the form ``$a$ is to $b$ what $c$ is to $d$'' at the core of analogical reasoning. The author has recently introduced an abstract algebraic framework of analogical proportions within the general setting of universal algebra. It is the purpose of this paper to further develop the mathematical theory of analogical proportions within that framework as motivated by the fact that it has already been successfully applied to logic program synthesis in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A logic of judgmental existence and its relation to proof irrelevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple natural deduction system for reasoning with judgments of the form "there exists a proof of $\varphi$" to explore the notion of judgmental existence following Martin-L\"{o}f's methodology of distinguishing between judgments and propositions. In this system, the existential judgment can be internalized into a modal notion of propositional existence that is closely related to truncation modality, a key tool for obtaining proof irrelevance, and lax modality. We provide a computational interpretation in the style of the Curry-Howard isomorphism for the existence modality and show that the corresponding system has some desirable properties such as strong normalization or subject reduction.</description>

      <title>First Order Logic of Sparse Graphs with Given Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider limit probabilities of first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence. Under mild conditions on the degree sequence, we show that the closure set of limit probabilities is a finite union of closed intervals. Moreover, we characterize the degree sequences for which this closure set is the interval $[0,1]$, a property that is intimately related with the probability that the random graph is acyclic. As a side result, we compile a full description of the cycle distribution of random graphs and study their fragment (disjoint union of unicyclic components) in the subcritical regime. Finally, we amend the proof of the existence of limit probabilities for first order properties in random graphs with a given degree sequence; this result was already claimed by Lynch~[IEEE LICS 2003] but his proof contained some inaccuracies.</description>

      <title>Owings-like theorems for infinitely many colours or finite monochromatic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Owings's problem, we investigate whether, for a given an Abelian group $G$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa,\theta$, every colouring $c:G\longrightarrow\theta$ yields a subset $X\subseteq G$ with $|X|=\kappa$ such that $X+X$ is monochromatic. (Owings's problem asks this for $G=\mathbb Z$, $\theta=2$ and $\kappa=\aleph_0$; while Hindman proved it false for the same $G$ and $\kappa$ but $\theta=3$.) We completely settle the question for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both finite (by obtaining sufficient and necessary conditions for a positive answer) and for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both infinite (with a negative answer). Also, in the case where $\theta$ is infinite but $\kappa$ is finite, we obtain some sufficient conditions for a negative answer as well as an example with a positive answer.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a (reduced) root system.

Then there is a first-order sentence $\phi_\Sigma$ in the language $\mathcal{L}=(1,0,+,*,-)$ of rings such that, for any algebraically closed field $\mathsf{k}$ of characteristic 0, the validity of the Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathsf{k}, \Sigma}$ is equivalent to $ACF_0 \vdash \phi_\Sigma$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop further the theory of monoidal bicategories by introducing and studying bicategorical counterparts of the notions of a linear explonential comonad, as considered in the study of linear logic, and of a codereliction transformation, introduced to study differential linear logic via differential categories. As an application, we extend the differential calculus of Joyal's analytic functors to analytic functors between presheaf categories, just as ordinary calculus extends from a single variable to many variables.</description>
