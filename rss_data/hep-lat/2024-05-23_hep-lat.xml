      <title>Uncovering gauge-dependent critical order-parameter correlations by a stochastic gauge fixing at O($N$)$^*$ and Ising$^*$ continuous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the O($N$)$^*$ transitions that occur in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector model, and the analogous Ising$^*$ transitions occurring in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge Higgs model, corresponding to an $N$-vector model with $N=1$. At these transitions, gauge-invariant correlations behave as in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. Instead, the nongauge invariant spin correlations are trivial and therefore the spin order parameter that characterizes the spontaneous breaking of the O($N$) symmetry in standard $N$-vector/Ising systems is apparently absent. We define a novel gauge fixing procedure -- we name it stochastic gauge fixing -- that allows us to define a gauge-dependent vector field that orders at the transition and is therefore the appropriate order parameter for the O($N$) symmetry breaking. To substantiate this approach, we perform numerical simulations for $N=3$ and $N=1$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the numerical data allows us to confirm the general scenario: the gauge-fixed spin correlation functions behave as the corresponding functions computed in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. The emergence of a critical vector order parameter in the gauge model shows the complete equivalence of the O($N$)$^*$/Ising$^*$ and O($N$)/Ising universality classes.</description>

      <title>Impact of gauge fixing precision on the continuum limit of non-local quark-bilinear lattice operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the gauge fixing precision dependence of some non-local quark-blinear lattice operators interesting in computing parton physics for several measurements, using 5 lattice spacings ranging from 0.032 fm to 0.121 fm. Our results show that gauge dependent non-local measurements are significantly more sensitive to the precision of gauge fixing than anticipated. The impact of imprecise gauge fixing is significant for fine lattices and long distances. For instance, even with the typically defined precision of Landau gauge fixing of $10^{-8}$, the deviation caused by imprecise gauge fixing can reach 12 percent, when calculating the trace of Wilson lines at 1.2 fm with a lattice spacing of approximately 0.03 fm. Similar behavior has been observed in $\xi$ gauge and Coulomb gauge as well. For both quasi PDFs and quasi TMD-PDFs operators renormalized using the RI/MOM scheme, convergence for different lattice spacings at long distance is only observed when the precision of Landau gauge fixing is sufficiently high. To describe these findings quantitatively, we propose an empirical formula to estimate the required precision.</description>

      <title>Deep learning lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods have led to profound insights into the strong-coupling behaviour of lattice gauge theories and produced remarkable results such as first-principles computations of hadron masses. Despite tremendous progress over the last four decades, fundamental challenges such as the sign problem and the inability to simulate real-time dynamics remain. Neural network quantum states have emerged as an alternative method that seeks to overcome these challenges. In this work, we use gauge-invariant neural network quantum states to accurately compute the ground state of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in $2+1$ dimensions. Using transfer learning, we study the distinct topological phases and the confinement phase transition of these theories. For $\mathbb{Z}_2$, we identify a continuous transition and compute critical exponents, finding excellent agreement with existing numerics for the expected Ising universality class. In the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ case, we observe a weakly first-order transition and identify the critical coupling. Our findings suggest that neural network quantum states are a promising method for precise studies of lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scarring in a Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) is an intriguing mechanism of ergodicity breaking that has recently spurred significant attention. Particularly prominent in Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), an open question is whether QMBS nontrivially arises in non-Abelian LGTs. Here, we present evidence of robust QMBS in a non-Abelian SU(2) LGT with dynamical matter. Starting in product states that require little experimental overhead, we show that prominent QMBS arises for certain quenches, facilitated through meson and baryon-antibaryon excitations, highlighting its non-Abelian nature. The uncovered scarred dynamics manifests as long-lived coherent oscillations in experimentally accessible local observables as well as prominent revivals in the state fidelity. Our findings bring QMBS to the realm of non-Abelian LGTs, highlighting the intimate connection between scarring and gauge symmetry, and are amenable for observation in a recently proposed trapped-ion qudit quantum computer.</description>

      <title>The metamorphosis of semi-classical mechanisms of confinement: From monopoles on ${\mathbb R}^3 \times S^1$ to center-vortices on ${\mathbb R}^2 \times T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are two distinct regimes of Yang-Mills theory where we can demonstrate confinement, the existence of a mass gap, and fractional theta angle dependence using a reliable semi-classical calculation. The two regimes are Yang-Mills theory on $S^1 \times {\mathbb R}^3$ with a small circle and a double-trace deformation, and Yang-Mills theory on $T^2 \times {\mathbb R}^2$ where the torus $T^2$ is small and threaded by a 't Hooft flux. In the first case the confinement mechanism is related to self-dual monopoles, whereas in the second case self-dual center-vortices play a crucial role. These two topological objects are distinct. In particular, they have different mutual statistics with Wilson loops. On the other hand, they carry the same topological charge and action. We show that one can derive the effective field theory of vortices, a deformed ${\mathbb Z}_N$ TQFT, from the effective theory of the magnetic Coulomb gas in the presence of a 't Hooft flux. We describe this result as a two-stage adjoint Higgs mechanism, where the first stage yields $U(1)^{N-1}$ EFT in 3d and second stage yields a ${\mathbb Z}_N$ EFT in 2d and 1d. This basic mechanism is flux fractionalization: The magnetic flux of the monopoles fractionalizes and collimates in such a way that 2d Wilson loops detect it as a center vortex.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon from $N_f = 2 + 1$ lattice QCD</title>

Abstract: There is a long-standing discrepancy between different measurements of the electric and magnetic radii of the proton. Lattice QCD calculations are a well-suited tool for theoretical investigations of the structure of the nucleon from first principles. However, all previous lattice studies of the proton's electromagnetic radii have either neglected quark-disconnected contributions or were not extrapolated to the continuum and infinite-volume limit. Here, we present results for the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron computed on the $(2 + 1)$-flavor Coordinated Lattice Simulations (CLS) ensembles including both quark-connected and -disconnected contributions. From simultaneous fits to the $Q^2$-, pion-mass, lattice-spacing, and finite-volume dependence of the form factors, we determine the electric and magnetic radii and the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron. For the proton, we obtain as our final values $\langle r_E^2 \rangle^p = (0.672 \pm 0.014$ (stat)${} \pm 0.018$ (syst)$)$ fm${}^2$, $\langle r_M^2 \rangle^p = (0.658 \pm 0.012$ (stat)${} \pm 0.008$ (syst)$)$ fm${}^2$, and $\mu_M^p = 2.739 \pm 0.063$ (stat)${} \pm 0.018$ (syst). The magnetic moment is in good agreement with the experimental value, as is the one of the neutron. On the one hand, our result for the electric (charge) radius of the proton clearly points towards a small value, as favored by muonic hydrogen spectroscopy and the recent $ep$-scattering experiment by PRad. Our estimate for the magnetic radius, on the other hand, is well compatible with that inferred from the A1 $ep$-scattering experiment.</description>

Abstract: We present lattice-QCD results for the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and neutron including both quark-connected and -disconnected contributions. The parametrization of the $Q^2$-dependence of the form factors is combined with the extrapolation to the physical point. In this way, we determine the electric and magnetic radii and the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron. For the proton, we obtain at the physical pion mass and in the continuum and infinite-volume limit $\sqrt{\langle r_E^2 \rangle^p} = 0.820(14)$ fm, $\sqrt{\langle r_M^2 \rangle^p} = 0.8111(89)$ fm, and $\mu_M^p = 2.739(66)$, where the errors include all systematics.</description>

      <title>Fate of Chiral Symmetries in the Quark-Gluon Plasma from an Instanton-Based Random Matrix Model of QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new way of understanding how chiral symmetry is realized in the high temperature phase of QCD. Based on the finding that a simple free instanton gas precisely describes the details of the lowest part of the spectrum of the lattice overlap Dirac operator, we propose an instanton-based random matrix model of QCD with dynamical quarks. Simulations of this model reveal that even for small quark mass the Dirac spectral density has a singularity at the origin, caused by a dilute gas of free instantons. Even though the interaction, mediated by light dynamical quarks creates small instanton-antiinstanton molecules, those do not influence the singular part of the spectrum, and this singular part is shown to dominate Banks-Casher type sums in the chiral limit. By generalizing the Banks-Casher formula for the singular spectrum, we show that in the chiral limit the chiral condensate vanishes if there are at least two massless flavors. Our model also indicates a possible way of resolving a long-standing debate, as it suggests that for two massless quark flavors the $U(1)_{A}$ symmetry is likely to remain broken up to arbitrarily high finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Electroweak three-body decays in the presence of two- and three-body bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, formalism has been derived for studying electroweak transition amplitudes for three-body systems both in infinite and finite volumes. The formalism provides exact relations that the infinite-volume amplitudes must satisfy, as well as a relationship between physical amplitudes and finite-volume matrix elements, which can be constrained from lattice QCD calculations. This formalism poses additional challenges when compared with the analogous well-studied two-body equivalent one, including the necessary step of solving integral equations of singular functions. In this work, we provide some non-trivial analytical and numerical tests on the aforementioned formalism. In particular, we consider a case where the three-particle system can have three-body bound states as well as bound states in the two-body subsystem. For kinematics below the three-body threshold, we demonstrate that the scattering amplitudes satisfy unitarity. We also check that for these kinematics the finite-volume matrix elements are accurately described by the formalism for two-body systems up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Finally, we verify that in the case of the three-body bound state, the finite-volume matrix element is equal to the infinite-volume coupling of the bound state, up to exponentially suppressed errors.</description>

Abstract: Recent data for the masses of $D$ and $D^*$ mesons determined using methods of lattice QCD for several values of the charm quark mass different from its physical mass are analysed in Heavy Quark Effective Theory. Nonperturbative parameters are extracted that arise at order ${\cal O}(1/m_c)$ in the heavy-quark mass expansion of a heavy-light meson mass. The determined parameters are used to establish the charm quark masses corresponding to the employed lattice sets.</description>

      <title>Color confinement due to spontaneous breaking of magnetic $U(1)_m^8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity is equal to 8 Abelian monopole currents of the Dirac type satisfying Abelian conservation rules kinematically. There exist magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries in non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. When the magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries are broken spontaneously, only states which are invariant under all $U(1)_e$ subgroups of $SU(3)$ can exist as a physical state. Such states are $SU(3)$ singlets. The QCD vacuum in the confinement phase is characterized by one long percolating monopole loop running over the whole lattice volume in both quenched and full QCD. The long loop in full QCD is on average a few times longer in comparison with that in quenched QCD case. Surprisingly, the monopole behaviors in full QCD seem independent of the bare quark mass suggesting irrelevance of Abelian monopoles to the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism.
  Existence of such Abelian magnetic monopoles in the continuum limit is studied in detail in $SU(3)$ by means of a block spin transformation of monopoles and the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The monopole density $\rho$ and the infrared effective monopole action $S(k)$ of $n$ blocked monopoles are determined for $a(\beta)=(0.04\sim 2)$fm and $n=1\sim 12$ blockings on $48^4$ lattice in quenched QCD and for $a(\beta)=0.0846(7)$fm and $n=1\sim 24$ on $96^4$ in full QCD at $m_\pi=146$MeV. Originally $\rho$ and $S(k)$ are a two-point function of $a(\beta)$ and the number of times of the blocking transformation $n$. However, both are found to be a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone in the quenched QCD which suggests the existence of the continuum limit. In the full QCD, the renormalization flow is observed similarly but the scaling is not yet proved. The distributions of the long loops show that monopole condensation occurs due to the entropy dominance over the energy for all $b$ considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ Abelian lattice gauge theories using a bootstrap method, in which the loop equations and positivity conditions are employed for Wilson loops with lengths $L\leqslant L_{\textrm{max}}$ to derive two-sided bounds on the Wilson loop averages. We address a fundamental question that whether the constraints from loop equations and positivity are strong enough to solve lattice gauge theories. We answer this question by bootstrapping the 2D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that with sufficiently large $L_{\textrm{max}}=60$, the two-sided bounds provide estimates for the plaquette averages with precision near $10^{-8}$ or even higher, suggesting the bootstrap constraints are sufficient to numerically pin down this theory. We compute the bootstrap bounds on the plaquette averages in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories with $L_{\textrm{max}}=16$. In the regions with weak or strong coupling, the two-sided bootstrap bounds converge quickly and coincide with the perturbative results to high precision. The bootstrap bounds are well consistent with the Monte Carlo results in the nonperturbative region. We observe interesting connections between the bounds generated by the bootstrap computations and the Griffiths' inequalities. We present results towards bootstrapping the string tension and glueball mass in Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>
