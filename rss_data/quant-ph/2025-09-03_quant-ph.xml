      <title>High-Distance Error-Correcting Codes for Fermion-to-Qubit Mappings in 2D and 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of fermionic systems is a leading application of quantum computers. One promising approach is to represent fermions with qubits via fermion-to-qubit mappings. In this work, we present high-distance fermion-to-qubit stabilizer codes for simulating 2D and 3D fermionic systems. These codes achieve arbitrarily large code distances while keeping stabilizer weights constant. They also preserve locality by mapping local fermionic operators to local qubit operators at any fixed distance. Notably, our 3D construction is the first to simultaneously achieve high distance, constant stabilizer weights, and locality preservation. Our construction is based on concatenating a small-distance 2D or 3D fermion-to-qubit code with a high-distance fermionic color code. Together, these features provide a robust and scalable pathway to quantum simulation of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>The rotation-invariant Hamiltonian problem is QMA$_{\rm EXP}$-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a variant of the local Hamiltonian problem where we restrict to Hamiltonians that live on a lattice and are invariant under translations and rotations of the lattice. In the one-dimensional case this problem is known to be QMA$_{\rm EXP}$-complete. On the other hand, if we fix the lattice length then in the high-dimensional limit the ground state becomes unentangled due to arguments from mean-field theory. We take steps towards understanding this complexity spectrum by studying a problem that is intermediate between these two extremes. Namely, we consider the regime where the lattice dimension is arbitrary but fixed and the lattice length is scaled. We prove that this rotation-invariant Hamiltonian problem is QMA$_{\rm EXP}$-complete answering an open question of [Gottesman, Irani 2013]. This characterizes a broad parameter range in which these rotation-invariant Hamiltonians have high computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Cost Hamiltonian Compilation for Max-Cut QAOA on Unweighted Graphs Using Global Controls and Qubit Bit Flips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a cost Hamiltonian compilation problem for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) applied to the Max-Cut problem, focusing on trapped-ion quantum computers. Instead of standard compilation with CNOT and Rz gates, we employ global coupling operations and single-qubit bit flips. Prior work by Rajakumar et al. established that such a compilation is always possible.
  Minimizing operational error requires short operation sequences. The problem reduces to a low-rank semi-discrete decomposition of the graph's adjacency matrix, where the minimum achievable rank, the graph coupling number gc(G), represents the number of global control layers. Rajakumar et al. introduced the Union of Stars construction, proving gc(G) &lt;= 3n - 2 for unweighted graphs with n vertices, and gave an O(m)-rank construction for weighted graphs.
  We concentrate on unweighted graphs. We derive structural properties of the compilation problem and show the Union of Stars method is order-optimal by proving a lower bound of gc(G) &gt;= n - 1 for a family of graphs. We also improve the general upper bound to 2.5n + 2. For particular graph families -- cliques, perfect matchings, paths, and cycles -- we provide sharper bounds. Further, we reveal a link between the problem and Hadamard matrix theory.
  Finally, we introduce a compact mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation that outperforms the previously studied exponential-size MIP.</description>

      <title>Large time-step discretisation of adiabatic quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum computing is a general framework for preparing eigenstates of Hamiltonians on quantum devices. However, its digital implementation requires an efficient Hamiltonian simulation subroutine, which may introduce extra computational overhead or complicated quantum control logic. In this work, we show that the time step sizes in time discretization can be much larger than expected, and the overall complexity is greatly reduced. Remarkably, regardless of the general convergence order of the numerical method, we can choose a uniform time step size independent of tolerated error and evolution time for sufficiently accurate simulation. Furthermore, with the boundary cancellation condition where the continuous diabatic errors are exponentially suppressed, we provide strong evidence on an exponential convergence of even first-order Trotter with uniform time step size. We apply our analysis to the example of adiabatic unstructured search and show several preferable features of the Trotterized adiabatic approach: it can match the Grover lower bound, it does not require a priori knowledge on the number of marked states, and its performance can be asymptotically comparable with that of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Strategies to search for two-dimensional materials with long spin qubit coherence time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that can host qubits with long spin coherence time (T2) have the distinct advantage of integrating easily with existing microelectronic and photonic platforms, making them attractive for designing novel quantum devices with enhanced performance. However, the relative lack of 2D materials as spin qubit hosts, as well as appropriate substrates that can help maintain long T2, necessitates a strategy to search for candidates with robust spin coherence. Here, we develop a high-throughput computational workflow to predict the nuclear spin bath-driven qubit decoherence and T2 in 2D materials and heterostructures. We initially screen 1173 2D materials and find 190 monolayers with T2 &gt; 1 ms, higher than that of naturally-abundant diamond. We then construct 1554 lattice-commensurate heterostructures between high-T2 2D materials and select 3D substrates, and we find that T2 is generally lower in a heterostructure than in the bare 2D host material; however, low-noise substrates (such as CeO2 and CaO) can help maintain high T2. To further accelerate the material screening effort, we derive analytical models that enable rapid predictions of T2 for 2D materials and heterotructures. The models offer a simple, yet quantitative, way to determine the relative contributions to decoherence from the nuclear spin baths of the 2D host and substrate in a heterostructural system. By developing a high-throughput workflow and analytical models, we expand the genome of 2D materials and their spin coherence times for the development of spin qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time quantum walk-based ans\"atze on neutral atom hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key use of near-term quantum computers is as analogue simulators, matching the action of some virtual or abstracted system onto a program executed on physical quantum hardware. This work explores continuous-time quantum walks (CTQW) on constrained graphs of independent set configurations and implements these abstract walks on analog-mode neutral-atom hardware. First, we explore variational state preparation protocols with limited controls through the lens of CTQW and optimal control to prepare nontrivial target states in non-separable Hilbert spaces. Next, we match these virtual walk dynamics to physical execution on analog-mode neutral atom hardware by leveraging the Rydberg blockade phenomenon. We analyze the convergence and scaling in the preparation of these known states as an indicator of the upper bounds on the quantum speedup mechanisms predicted by ideal CTQWs, showing that these signatures persist even when executed on noisy hardware. Finally, we introduce noise mitigation methods using Bayesian postprocessing. This paper demonstrates the ability to prepare nontrivial entangled states using quantum walks in constrained subspaces, and that nonequilibrium dynamics on constrained independent set supspaces is feasible on cloud-accessible analog-mode neutral-atom quantum computers.</description>

      <title>An exploration of the noise sensitivity of the Shor's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms face significant challenges due to qubit susceptibility to environmental noise, and quantum error correction typically requires prohibitive resource overhead. This paper proposes that quantum algorithms may possess inherent noise resilience characteristics that could reduce implementation barriers. We investigate Shor's algorithm by applying circuit-level noise models directly to the original algorithm circuit. Our findings reveal that Shor's algorithm demonstrates superior fault tolerance under Z noise compared to X and Y noise. Focusing on the modular exponentiation circuit which is the core component of the algorithm, we conduct fault-tolerant position statistics on circuits with bit lengths from 4 to 9. The results show that under Z noise, fault-tolerant positions grow with the same quartic polynomial order as potential error positions as the problem scale increases. In contrast, fault tolerance under X and Y noise exhibits a strong dependence on the composite number N and the parameter a. Based on these findings, we develop an extrapolation method predicting that the minimum probability of a correct output of the modular exponentiation circuit to factor 2048 bit integers under biased noise is approximately 1.417*{10}^{-17}.</description>

      <title>Polynomial complexity of open quantum system problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems (OQS's) are ubiquitous in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics and in quantum science and technology. Solving the dynamics of an OQS in a quantum many-body bath has been considered a computationally hard problem because of the dimensionality curse. Here, considering that full knowledge of the bath dynamics is unnecessary for describing the reduced dynamics of an OQS, we prove a polynomial complexity theorem, that is, the number of independent equations required to fully describe the dynamics of an OQS increases at most linearly with the evolution time and polynomially with the bath size. Therefore, efficient computational algorithms exist for solving the dynamics of a small-sized OQS (such as a qubit or an atom). We further prove that, when the dynamics of an OQS and the bath is represented by a tensor network, a tensor contraction procedure can be specified such that the bond dimension (i.e., the range of tensor indices contracted in each step) increases only linearly (rather than exponentially) with the evolution time, providing explicitly efficient algorithms for a wide range of OQS's. We demonstrate the theorems and the tensor-network algorithm by solving two widely encountered OQS problems, namely, a spin in a Gaussian bath (the spin-boson model) and a central spin coupled to many environmental spins (the Gaudin model). This work provides approaches to understanding dynamics of OQS's, learning the environments via quantum sensors, and optimizing quantum information processing in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum States in Twisted Tubes with Linear Cross-Section Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a twisted tube with a linearly varying cross section. By relating a general linear transformation matrix to the system's Hamiltonian, we use an extended thin-layer method to derive an effective Hamiltonian for tangential motion under mild and general linear transformations. Explicit forms are provided for three fundamental transformations: rotation, scaling, and shearing. Rotation introduces a gauge field coupled to angular momentum, while scaling and shearing produce geometric potentials that lift degeneracies in non-circular cross sections. In square cross sections, these transformations cause energy splittings among formerly degenerate states, whereas circular cross sections retain degeneracy. Through an example combining rotation and squeezing, we analyze state evolution and compute the quantum geometric tensor to quantify geometric response. Our results demonstrate how geometric transformations can tailor quantum states and suggest that circular waveguides are more robust against mode mixing.</description>

      <title>Breaking the system-frequency limitation of quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00438v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the system performance has been the primary mission in the domain of quantum key distributions in recent years. Higher performance necessitates a higher repetition frequency, which is, however, strictly limited by the bandwidth. Excessive increase in the repetition frequency is not justifiable since it leads to misaligned and correlated modulation, resulting in compromised security and significant errors. Meanwhile, replacing devices with higher bandwidth means more technique challenges and more expense, which is detrimental to practical implementations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive countermeasure to overcome the bandwidth limitation. We present a new protocol addressing the aforementioned loopholes to ensure security and achieve superior performance compared to previous approaches. Additionally, we address the challenges associated with characterizing and mitigating the correlations by developing two techniques. An experiment setup is completed in this work, whose result indicates that our technique achieves the lowest correlated deviation in all similar works and our proposal breaks the bandwidth-limited secret key rate, thus releasing people from the trade-off between performance and cost, paving the way for practical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-IV vacancy (G4V, or XV, where X = Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) color centers constitute a novel and promising class of defects in diamonds. This chapter reviews and refines the theoretical models for the XV systems, encompassing the intrinsic interactions, including spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon interactions, and the external interactions involving strain, electric, light, and magnetic fields. Based on the refined model, we predict their properties, explain the experimental data, and suggest follow-up experiments. This article established a solid foundation for controlling the XV system, thus paving the way for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that one can exploit the representation of the Dicke state with magnetic quantum number $0$ in orthogonal bases to increase the probability of producing a large Kitten state or even a Cat state via dissipative one-axis twisting, resulting in a net increase in metrological sensitivity and robustness against white noise with respect to the initial state. The resulting states are also useful for quantum secret sharing. The success of the scheme is heralded by the rate of photoemissions. Unlike previous iterations, we have an important population of the larger Kitten states, which makes post-selecting trajectories for them feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning deals with leveraging quantum theory with classic machine learning algorithms. Current research efforts study the advantages of using quantum mechanics or quantum information theory to accelerate learning time or convergence. Other efforts study data transformations in the quantum information space to evaluate robustness and performance boosts. This paper focuses on processing input data using randomized quantum circuits that act as quantum convolutions producing new representations that can be used in a convolutional network. Experimental results suggest that the performance is comparable to classic convolutional neural networks, and in some instances, using quantum convolutions can accelerate convergence.</description>

      <title>Entropy Flow at the Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal management is a key challenge, both globally and microscopically in integrated circuits and quantum technologies. The associated heat flow $I_Q$ has been understood since the advent of thermodynamics by a process of elimination, $I_Q{=}I_E{-}\mu I_N$, subtracting from the energy flow $I_E$ its convective contribution. However, in the quantum limit, this formula implies the paradoxical result that the entropy entrained by heat flow is unbounded even though the entropy itself tends to zero. We resolve this conundrum by recognizing that the traditional formula for heat is missing a quantum term. The correct quantum formula predicts that the heat produced in quantum processes is vastly smaller than previously believed, with correspondingly beneficial consequences for the efficiency of quantum machines.</description>

      <title>It's-A-Me, Quantum Mario: Scalable Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Chip Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) promises compact function approximators with access to vast Hilbert spaces, but its practical progress is slowed by NISQ-era constraints such as limited qubits and noise accumulation. We introduce a multi-chip ensemble framework using multiple small Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to overcome these constraints. Our approach partitions complex, high-dimensional observations from the Super Mario Bros environment across independent quantum circuits, then classically aggregates their outputs within a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework. This modular architecture enables QRL in complex environments previously inaccessible to quantum agents, achieving superior performance and learning stability compared to classical baselines and single-chip quantum models. The multi-chip ensemble demonstrates enhanced scalability by reducing information loss from dimensionality reduction while remaining implementable on near-term quantum hardware, providing a practical pathway for applying QRL to real-world problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing near exceptional points (EPs) in non-Hermitian systems has shown promising sensitivity enhancements. However, practical applications are often hindered by structural complexity and strict parameter constraints. In this work, we introduce a simplified anti-parity-time (anti-PT) symmetric platform consisting of two independently cavities, which are indirectly coupled to each other by a shared dissipative environment. We demonstrate a significantly enhanced sensing response at the EPs compared to non-EP configurations. This improvement is attributed to the dominant second-order term in the Laurent series expansion of the eigenvalue response to external perturbations-a characteristic feature of higher-order singularities at EPs. This mechanism not only reinforces the foundation for sensitivity enhancement but also offers a structurally compact and robust strategy for quantum sensing. Our results underscore the potential of anti-PT symmetric systems in enabling high-precision sensing technologies and bridging non-Hermitian physics with scalable photonic device platforms.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature alignment-free magnetometry with boron vacancies in hot-pressed hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic field sensing is essential for applications in communication, environmental monitoring, and biomedical diagnostics. Quantum sensors based on solid-state spin defects, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond or boron vacancies in single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), typically require precise alignment between the external magnetic field and the defect's spin quantization axis to achieve reliable sensing. This alignment constraint complicates device integration and hinders scalability. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from negatively charged boron vacancies (VB-) in commercially available hot-pressed polycrystalline hBN. The random grain orientation inherently samples a broad range of spin quantization axes, enabling alignment-free magnetic field detection. Numerical modeling further confirms that sensing remains feasible despite anisotropic sensitivity, establishing hot-pressed hBN as a robust and practical platform for quantum magnetometry. This approach paves the way toward low-cost, scalable, and mechanically stable quantum magnetic field sensors suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Causality: Resolving Simpson's Paradox with $\mathcal{DO}$-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing correlation from causation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, often representing a critical barrier to building robust and trustworthy systems. While Pearl's $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''. We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a 3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a 10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference, offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in algorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).</description>

      <title>Classical algorithms for measurement-adaptive Gaussian circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian building blocks are essential for photonic quantum information processing, and universality can be practically achieved by equipping Gaussian circuits with adaptive measurement and feedforward. The number of adaptive steps then provides a natural parameter for computational power. Rather than assessing power only through sampling problems -- the usual benchmark -- we follow the ongoing shift toward tasks of practical relevance and study the quantum mean-value problem, i.e., estimating observable expectation values that underpin simulation and variational algorithms. More specifically, we analyze bosonic circuits with adaptivity and prove that when the number of adaptive measurements is small, the mean-value problem admits efficient classical algorithms even if a large amount of non-Gaussian resources are present in the input state, whereas less constrained regimes are computationally hard. This yields a task-level contrast with sampling, where non-Gaussian ingredients alone often induce hardness, and provides a clean complexity boundary parameterized by the number of adaptive measurement-and-feedforward steps between classical simulability and quantum advantage. Beyond the main result, we introduce classical techniques -- including a generalization of Gurvits's second algorithm to arbitrary product inputs and Gaussian circuits -- for computing the marginal quantities needed by our estimators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Noise-Resilient Quantum Metrology with Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has made remarkable strides in recent years, as demonstrated by quantum supremacy experiments and the realization of high-fidelity, fault-tolerant gates. However, a major obstacle persists: practical real-world applications remain scarce, largely due to the inefficiency of loading classical data into quantum processors. Here, we propose an alternative strategy that shifts the focus from classical data encoding to directly processing quantum data. We target quantum metrology, a practical quantum technology whose precision is often constrained by realistic noise. We develop an experimentally feasible scheme in which a quantum computer optimizes information acquired from quantum metrology, thereby enhancing performance in noisy quantum metrology tasks and overcoming the classical-data-loading bottleneck. We demonstrate this approach through experimental implementation with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond and numerical simulations using models of distributed superconducting quantum processors. Our results show that this method improves the accuracy of sensing estimates and significantly boosts sensitivity, as quantified by the quantum Fisher information, thus offering a new pathway to harness near-term quantum computers for realistic quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Determination of Fluctuation correlation time in solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state NMR provides a wide variety of experimental techniques to detect and analyze a material's chemical and physical environment. Here, we offer a theoretical demonstration of a new approach that could be a promising candidate for characterizing the local environments and shifts. Prethermalization by applying a spin-locking pulse brings a new research paradigm in solid-state NMR and has not been hitherto explored for such purposes. We show that a prethermal state can also be effective in this case. A prethermal state is described using its lifetime and the value of transverse magnetization. Using these two variables, we successfully detect the changes in the environmental parameter and chemical and dynamical shifts (such as Lamb shifts). Our results exhibit that the lifetime increases with increasing environmental correlation time. On the other hand, the transverse magnetization decreases with the increase in the strength of the shift parameter. Based on these observations, we propose that the prethermalization dynamics can yield important information on local environment.</description>

      <title>Would the fidelity of quantum teleportation be increased by a local filtering operation near a dilaton black hole under decoherence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that the effects of black holes and environmental decoherence generally negatively influence quantum correlations and the fidelity of quantum teleportation in curved spacetime. In our paper, we find that as the dilaton parameter increases, the fidelity of quantum teleportation can either decrease or increase, which suggests that even in the presence of system-environment coupling, the dilaton effect of black hole can positive influence teleportation fidelity; specifically, the dilaton effect can create net fidelity in quantum teleportation under decoherence. This interesting result challenges the long-held belief that the effects of black holes and environmental decoherence can only reduce the fidelity of quantum teleportation. Additionally, we observe an unreported result: if the fidelity of quantum teleportation remains in the classical region, it can be transformed into the quantum region by utilizing a local filtering operation, thereby achieving better fidelity than classical communication. This impressive result may provide new insights for developing an experimental scheme to effectively implement quantum teleportation in the context of dilaton black holes under decoherence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework named Trainmon is introduced to reverse-engineer a quantum potential well for superconducting qubits. Trainmon consists of parallel branches of identical Josephson junctions. The Hamiltonian for this circuit resembles a discrete cosine transform, which can be applied to mimic various potentials. This framework is applied to well-known qubit potentials such as Quarton and Fluxonium, and their Hamiltonians are extracted and solved to validate the transition frequencies and calculate the coherence times of both the original qubits and their Trainmon-based versions.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical correlations and quadrature squeezing of photons in anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates nonclassical effects of photons in the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model by using a quantum dressed master equation. We analyze second- and higher-order correlation functions, and demonstrate that the nonlinear Stark coupling significantly modulates photon statistics, inducing distinct and tunable photon antibunching and bunching effects. Successive transition signatures of correlation functions provide a potential experimental probe for predicting quantum phase transitions. We further reveal that Stark coupling provides direct control over photon squeezing, achieving significant enhancement and suppression. These findings not only uncover rich nonclassical phenomena in the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model but also establish the nonlinear Stark coupling as a crucial new dimension for quantum detection. It may open a new avenue for precise manipulation of strongly coupled light-matter systems, with potential applications in quantum information processing and quantum-enhanced technologies.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm is a computational scheme in which quantum circuits are used to extract information that is then processed by a classical routine to guide subsequent quantum operations. These algorithms are especially valuable in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where quantum resources are constrained and classical optimization plays a central role. Here, we improve the performance of a hybrid algorithm through principled, information-theoretic optimization. We focus on Quantum Likelihood Estimation (QLE) - a hybrid algorithm designed to identify the Hamiltonian governing a quantum system by iteratively updating a weight distribution based on measurement outcomes and Bayesian inference. While QLE already achieves convergence using quantum measurements and Bayesian inference, its efficiency can vary greatly depending on the choice of parameters at each step. We propose an optimization strategy that dynamically selects the initial state, measurement basis, and evolution time in each iteration to maximize the mutual information between the measurement outcome and the true Hamiltonian. This approach builds upon the information-theoretic framework recently developed in [A. Te'eni et al. Oracle problems as communication tasks and optimization of quantum algorithms, arXiv:2409.15549], and leverages mutual information as a guiding cost function for parameter selection. Our implementation employs a simulated annealing routine to minimize the conditional von Neumann entropy, thereby maximizing information gain in each iteration. The results demonstrate that our optimized version significantly reduces the number of iterations required for convergence, thus proposing a practical method for accelerating Hamiltonian learning in quantum systems. Finally, we propose a general scheme that extends our approach to solve a broader family of quantum learning problems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-Markovian Decoherent Histories in Integrable Environment: A "Tape Recorder" Model for Local Quantum Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to coarse-grained descriptions of a system that provides an explicit evaluation of multi-time decoherent histories in a controlled way, applicable to non-Markovian and integrable systems. Specifically, we study a local interaction quench of a local degree of freedom (an open quantum system) within a noninteracting integrable environment. This setting allows us to identify the environmental degrees of freedom that irreversibly store records of the system's past. These modes emerge sequentially in time and define the projections required for decoherent histories. We show numerically that the off-diagonal elements of the decoherence functional are exponentially suppressed relative to a significance threshold.</description>

      <title>A simple universal routing strategy for reducing the connectivity requirements of quantum LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check codes reduce quantum error correction overhead but require dense, long-range connectivity that challenges hardware implementation, particularly for superconducting processors. We address this problem by demonstrating that long-range connections can be reduced at the cost of increased syndrome extraction circuit depth. Our approach is based on the observation that X and Z ancilla qubits form short loops with data qubits - a property that holds for any quantum code. This enables implementing stabilizer measurement circuits by routing data qubit information through ancilla qubits when direct connections are unavailable. For bivariate bicycle codes, we remove up to 50% of long-range connections while approximately doubling the circuit depth, with the circuit-level distance remaining largely preserved. This method can also be applied to surface codes, achieving the same hexagonal connectivity requirement as McEwen et al. (Quantum 7, 1172 (2023)). Our routing approach for designing syndrome extraction circuits is applicable to diverse quantum codes, offering a practical pathway toward their implementation on hardware with connectivity constraints.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Advantages and Limitations of Quantum Neural Networks in Regression Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum neural networks (QNNs) has attracted considerable attention due to their potential to surpass classical models in certain machine learning tasks. Nonetheless, it remains unclear under which conditions QNNs provide concrete benefits over classical neural networks (CNNs). This study addresses this question by performing both qualitative and quantitative analyses of classical and quantum models applied to regression problems, using two target functions with contrasting properties. Additionally, the work explores the methodological difficulties inherent in making fair comparisons between QNNs and CNNs. The findings reveal a distinct advantage of QNNs in a specific quantum machine learning context. In particular, QNNs excelled at approximating the sinusoidal function, achieving errors up to seven orders of magnitude lower than their classical counterparts. However, their performance was limited in other cases, emphasizing that QNNs are highly effective for certain tasks but not universally sPuperior. These results reinforce the principles of the ``No Free Lunch'' theorem, highlighting that no single model outperforms all others across every problem domain.</description>

      <title>Deformation-Driven Enhancement of Spin Defect Emission in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been extensively investigated as it offers a novel playground for two-dimensional quantum sensing, with ultimate proximity to target samples. However, its practical sensitivity is limited by the intrinsically weak photoluminescence of the spin ensemble. Here, we report a photoluminescence enhancement of up to 30 times from VB- centers in suspended regions of hBN compared to those in substrate-supported areas. The key spin properties, such as the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast and linewidth, as well as the spin lifetime, of the VB- centers in this region are well preserved. Detailed investigations, including measurements of zero-field ODMR, Raman spectroscopy, and Kelvin probe force microscopy, reveal a correlation between emission enhancement and local deformation in the sample. It is concluded that the suspended regions exhibit higher local deformation compared to the supported areas, breaking the local symmetry and thereby activating otherwise forbidden or weak optical transitions of the VB- centers.</description>

      <title>Do quantum linear solvers offer advantage for networks-based system of linear equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4 percent of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20 percent of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning Applied to the Sinking of the Titanic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the performance of hybrid quantum-classical variational classifiers applied to a supervised learning task involving the titanic3 dataset. Quantum models were constructed using Pauli entangling and non-entangling expansion-based feature maps and the RealAmplitudes ansatz with up to 50 variational parameters. Model training employed the COBYLA gradient-free optimizer to minimize the cross-entropy loss, within an ideal statevector simulation framework. Comparative performance analysis reveals that the models based on the non-entangling feature map consistently outperformed the models based on the entangling features maps, achieving saturation of classification metrics (accuracy, balanced accuracy, and Youden's index) beyond 15 to 20 parameters. Further, two quantum models were benchmarked against a classical Support Vector Classifier (SVC). While both approaches yielded similar predictive performance across multiple training sizes, the classical model exhibited a performance collapse when trained with 90% of the dataset, a failure mode absent in the quantum classifiers. These results underscore the robustness and viability of variational quantum classifiers for binary classification tasks on classical datasets in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>One- and multiphoton resonances in the light-atom interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between atomic systems and electromagnetic fields is central to modern physics and emerging quantum technologies. The Rabi models, in their semiclassical and quantum versions, provide the simplest and most fundamental description of this interaction. In this work, we present a concise derivation of both models and show how one- and multiphoton resonances arise in the semiclassical regime. We then analyze how these resonances manifest in the quantum Rabi model, discussing similarities and differences in relation to the classical description. Special attention is given to the three-photon resonance, a phenomenon usually neglected in textbooks due to its relative weakness, but which is intrinsic to the radiation-matter interaction. Our goal is to offer an accessible pedagogical reference for students and researchers interested in Quantum Optics and Quantum Information, with an emphasis on the fundamentals of the Rabi models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Physical Unclonable Function based on Chaotic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Physical Unclonable Functions (QPUFs) are hardware-based cryptographic primitives with strong theoretical security. This security stems from their modeling as Haar-random unitaries. However, implementing such unitaries on Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices is challenging due to exponential simulation complexity. Previous work tackled this using pseudo-random unitary designs but only under limited adversarial models with only black-box query access. In this paper, we propose a new QPUF construction based on chaotic quantum dynamics. We modeled the QPUF as a unitary time evolution under a chaotic Hamiltonian and proved that this approach offers security comparable to Haar-random unitaries. Intuitively, we show that while chaotic dynamics generate less randomness than ideal Haar unitaries, the randomness is still sufficient to make the QPUF unclonable in polynomial time. We identified the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model as a candidate for the QPUF Hamiltonian. Recent experiments using nuclear spins and cold atoms have shown progress toward achieving this goal. Inspired by recent experimental advances, we present a schematic architecture for realizing our proposed QPUF device based on optical Kagome Lattice with disorder. For adversaries with only query access, we also introduce an efficiently simulable pseudo-chaotic QPUF. Our results lay the preliminary groundwork for bridging the gap between theoretical security and the practical implementation of QPUFs for the first time.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Solution of Non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and Operator Construction of Quantum Stochastic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Markovian quantum state diffusion provides a wavefunction-based framework for modeling open quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a novel machine learning approach based on an operator construction algorithm. This algorithm employs a neural network as a universal generator to reconstruct the stochastic time evolution operator from an ensemble of quantum trajectories. Unlike conventional machine learning methods that merely approximate time-dependent wavefunctions or expectation values, our operator-based approach yields broader applications and enhanced interpretability of the stochastic process. We benchmark the algorithm on the spin-boson model across diverse spectral densities, demonstrating its accuracy. Furthermore, we showcase the operator's utility in calculating absorption spectra and reconstructing reduced density matrices at extended timescales. These results establish a new paradigm for the application of machine learning in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Seniority-based Subspace Expansion: Linear Combinations of Short-Circuit Unitary Transformations for Efficient Quantum Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum SENiority-based Subspace Expansion (Q-SENSE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that interpolates between the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Configuration Interaction (CI) methods. It constructs Hamiltonian matrix elements on a quantum device and solves the resulting eigenvalue problem classically. This seniority-symmetry-based approach reduces one of the primary limitations of VQE on near-term quantum hardware - circuit depth - by exchanging lower circuit complexity for the need to compute additional matrix elements. Unlike other expansion-based methods - such as Quantum Subspace Expansion (QSE), Quantum Krylov Subspace Expansion, and the Non-orthogonal Quantum Eigensolver - Q-SENSE leverages symmetry-induced orthogonality to construct basis states in distinct symmetry sectors. This not only guarantees orthogonality but also reduces the number of Hamiltonian terms that must be measured, as many terms are zero between different symmetry subspaces. By systematically combining symmetry principles with matrix-based techniques, Q-SENSE offers a scalable and resource-efficient potential route to quantum advantage on near-term quantum devices and in the early fault-tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>High-efficiency Weak-trace-free Counterfactual Communication via Quantum Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Zeno effect, which inhibits quantum state evolution via repeated weak measurements, significantly enhances the efficiency of interaction-free measurement (IFM). This fundamental mechanism facilitates high-efficiency counterfactual quantum communication, enabling information delivery without particle transmission through the channel. However, the transmission time of the counterfactual communication requires minutes for bit and suffers the bit error when transmitting an image. Applying the quantum Zeno effect, we experimentally demonstrate high-efficiency weak-trace-free counterfactual communication on a quantum photonic chip, achieving a transmission probability of $74.2 \pm 1.6\%$ for bit 0 and $85.1 \pm 1.3\%$ for bit 1. Furthermore, we successfully transmit our group's logo --Quanta-- through counterfactual communication, and reduce the time cost from minutes to seconds for bit, with zero bit errors after information processing. Our study provides a promising approach for secure and efficient communication using integrated silicon quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Cutting stabiliser decompositions of magic state cultivation with ZX-calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the cutting stabiliser decomposition techniques [arXiv:2403.10964] to the quantum states generated from magic state cultivation [arXiv:2409.17595], post-selected upon all $+1$ measured values for simplicity. The resultant states to the $d=3$ and $d=5$ variant magic state cultivation circuits can be expressed as a sum of $4$ and $8$ Clifford ZX-digrams respectively. Modifications to existing ZX-calculus stabiliser decomposition methods may enable better simulation of non-Clifford circuits containing a moderate number of $T$ gates in the context of quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>Efficient Maximum Clique Detection via Grover's Algorithm with Real-time Global Size Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum clique problem (MCP) is to find the largest complete subgraph in an undirected graph, that is, the subgraph in which there are edges between every two different vertices. It is an NP-Hard problem with wide applications, including bioinformatics, social networks, data mining, and other fields. This paper proposes an improved algorithm that dynamically tracks the maximum clique size by encoding prior constraints on the vertex count-derived from Tur\'an's theorem and complete graph properties-into global variables through quantum circuit pre-detection. The algorithm further synergizes with Grover's search to optimize the solution space. Our auxiliary-qubit encoding scheme dynamically tracks clique sizes during quantum search, eliminating iterative measurements, achieving MCP solution with $O\left(\sqrt{2^n}\right)$ Grover iterations and $O(1)$ measurements. This represents an $\boldsymbol{n}$-fold improvement over state-of-the-art Grover-based methods, which require $O(n\sqrt{2^n})$ iterations and $O(n)$ measurements for $n$-vertex graphs. We validate algorithmic correctness through simulations on IBM's Qiskit platform and benchmark qubit/gate efficiency against existing Grover-based MCP solvers.</description>

      <title>Duality of extremal quantum states in verification and data hiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state verification (QSV) and quantum data hiding (QDH) have so far been studied separately. QSV decides whether a given quantum state is close to the ideal one, with significantly lower sample complexity compared with direct application of quantum tomography. On the other hand, QDH is a cryptographic protocol that encodes secret classical information in multipartite quantum states, providing stronger security guarantees than conventional classical secret-sharing schemes. Here, we consider two fundamental quantities of a pure quantum state, determining the sample complexity needed for QSV or the security level in QDH. We demonstrate that a pure state is most difficult to verify in QSV if and only if it is most secure in QDH with respect to those quantities. Furthermore, for such extremal states, the two fundamental quantities coincide. We also generalize this relationship to one between the security of QDH using mixed states and the sample complexity for quantum subspace verification, which is a generalization of QSV. As an application, we show the existence of efficient QSV protocols that are generalizations of the existing ones and examine the fundamental limitations on QDH by synthesizing research from both domains.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Local Friendliness: An epsilon-Bounded Interaction-Free Paradox and a Disturbance-Robust Three-Box Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new paradox, which we call Counterfactual Local Friendliness (CLF): a Wigner's-friend-type logical collision in which every decisive inference is obtained by interaction-free flags whose disturbance on the probed object is bounded by a tunable parameter $\epsilon$. Under (Q) universal unitarity for outside observers, (S) single-outcome facts, (C) cross-agent consistency, and (IF-$\epsilon$) $\epsilon$-counterfactuality of the friends' internal modules, quantum theory predicts a nonzero post-selected event that forces mutually incompatible certainties about a single upstream variable -- without appealing to absorptive or projective in-lab measurements.
  We also derive an $\epsilon$-IF three-box noncontextual bound: any single-world, noncontextual model satisfying exclusivity and epsilon-stability must obey $P(A) + P(B) \le 1 + K_\epsilon$, while quantum theory yields $P(A) = P(B) = 1$, violating the bound for arbitrarily small $\epsilon$. Together these results isolate what is paradoxical about counterfactual phenomena: not energy exchange with the probed system, but the incompatibility of agent-level facts in single-world narratives.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg limited quantum algorithm for estimating the fidelity susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fidelity susceptibility serves as a universal probe for quantum phase transitions, offering an order-parameter-free metric that captures ground-state sensitivity to Hamiltonian perturbations and exhibits critical scaling. Classical computation of this quantity, however, is limited by exponential Hilbert space growth and correlation divergence near criticality, restricting analyses to small or specialized systems. Here, we present a quantum algorithm that achieves efficient and Heisenberg-limited estimation of fidelity susceptibility through a novel resolvent reformulation, leveraging quantum singular value transformation for pseudoinverse block encoding with amplitude estimation for norm evaluation. This constitutes the first quantum algorithm for fidelity susceptibility with optimal precision scaling. Moreover, for frustration-free Hamiltonians, we show that the resolvent can be approximated with a further quadratic speedup. Our work bridges quantum many-body physics and algorithmic design, enabling scalable exploration of quantum criticality with applications in materials simulation, metrology, and beyond on fault-tolerant quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Exploring Quantum Machine Learning for Weather Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a crucial role in supporting strategic decisions across various sectors, including agriculture, renewable energy production, and disaster management. However, the inherently dynamic and chaotic behavior of the atmosphere presents significant challenges to conventional predictive models. On the other hand, introducing quantum computing simulation techniques to the forecasting problems constitutes a promising alternative to overcome these challenges. In this context, this work explores the emerging intersection between quantum machine learning (QML) and climate forecasting. We present the implementation of a Quantum Neural Network (QNN) trained on real meteorological data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) database. The results show that QNN has the potential to outperform a classical Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in terms of accuracy and adaptability to abrupt data shifts, particularly in wind speed prediction. Despite observed nonlinearities and architectural sensitivities, the QNN demonstrated robustness in handling temporal variability and faster convergence in temperature prediction. These findings highlight the potential of quantum models in short and medium term climate prediction, while also revealing key challenges and future directions for optimization and broader applicability.</description>

      <title>Effect of Single-Ion Anisotropy on Stability of Quantum and Thermal Entanglement in a Mixed-Spin Heisenberg Trimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of uniaxial single-ion anisotropy on quantum entanglement is rigorously quantified using negativity in a mixed spin-($1$,$1/2$,$1$) Heisenberg trimer, accounting for different exchange coupling constants between identical and distinct spins. Bipartite negativities between the single-spin entity and the remaining spin dimer are analyzed alongside the global tripartite negativity (gTN) of the whole trimer under the effect of an external magnetic field and both easy-axis and easy-plane types of single-ion anisotropy. Interestingly, the single-ion anisotropy significantly influences the degree of entanglement by altering the stability regions of energetically preferred ground states and it may also introduce additional phases in the overall ground-state phase diagram. Moreover, it is demonstrated that within specific ground states, the degree of entanglement primarily depends on the strength of single-ion anisotropy, altering the respective probability amplitudes of the corresponding eigenvectors. Finally, the thermal stability of entanglement is discussed in detail, including the emergence of a peculiar local minimum at finite temperatures. The obtained theoretical results may offer deeper insights into bipartite and tripartite entanglement in trimetallic Ni$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$-Ni$^{2+}$ molecular compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool for applications ranging from chemical analysis to quantum information processing. Achieving optical initialization and detection of molecular nuclear spins promises new opportunities - including improved NMR signals at low magnetic field, sensitivity down to the single-molecule level, and full access to atomically precise molecular architectures for quantum technologies. In this study, we report optical readout of coherently controlled nuclear spins in a europium-based molecular crystal. By harnessing ultra-narrow optical transitions, we achieve optical initialization and detection of nuclear spin states. Through radio-frequency driving, we address two nuclear quadrupole resonances, characterized by narrow inhomogeneous linewidths and a distinct correlation with the optical transition frequency. We implement Rabi oscillations, spin echo and dynamical decoupling techniques, achieving nuclear spin quantum coherence with a lifetime of up to 2 ms. These results highlight the capabilities of optically detected NMR (ODNMR) and underscore the potential of molecular nuclear spins for quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology explores optimal quantum protocols for parameter estimation. In the context of optical atomic clocks, conventional protocols focus on optimal input states and measurements to achieve enhanced sensitivities. However, such protocols are typically limited by phase slip errors inflicted due to the decoherence of the local oscillator. Here, we study schemes to extend the dynamic range and overcome phase slip noise through weak measurements with ancilla qubits. Using coherent spin states, we find optimal weak measurements protocols: we identify optimal measurement strength for any given interrogation time and number of atoms. Then, we combine weak and projective measurements to construct a protocol that asymptotically saturates the noiseless precision limits, and outperforms previously proposed methods for phase slip noise suppression.</description>

Abstract: Measuring the state of quantum computers is a highly non-trivial task, with implications for virtually all quantum algorithms. We propose a novel scheme where identical copies of a quantum state are measured jointly so that all Pauli operators within the considered observable can be simultaneously assessed. We use Bayesian statistics to accurately estimate the average and error, and develop an adaptive shot-allocation algorithm that preferentially samples the most uncertain Pauli terms. In regimes with many non-commuting Pauli operators, our ``double'' scheme can outperform the state-of-the-art measurement protocol in minimizing total shots for a given precision.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio optimization is one of the most studied optimization problems at the intersection of quantum computing and finance. In this work, we develop the first quantum formulation for a portfolio optimization problem with higher-order moments, skewness and kurtosis. Including higher-order moments leads to more detailed modeling of portfolio return distributions. Portfolio optimization with higher-order moments has been studied in classical portfolio optimization approaches but with limited exploration within quantum formulations. In the context of quantum optimization, higher-order moments generate higher-order terms in the cost Hamiltonian. Thus, instead of obtaining a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, we obtain a higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problem, which has a natural formulation as a parametrized circuit. Additionally, we employ realistic integer variable encoding and a capital-based budget constraint. We consider the classical continuous variable solution with integer programming-based discretization to be the computationally efficient classical baseline for the problem. Our extensive experimental evaluation of 100 portfolio optimization problems shows that the solutions to the HUBO formulation often correspond to better portfolio allocations than the classical baseline. This is a promising result for those who want to perform computationally challenging portfolio optimization on quantum hardware, as portfolio optimization with higher moments is classically complex. Moreover, the experimental evaluation studies QAOA's performance with higher-order terms in this practically relevant problem.</description>

      <title>Traq: Estimating the Quantum Cost of Classical Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting practical speedups offered by future quantum computers has become a major focus of the quantum computing community. Typically, these predictions are supported by lengthy manual analyses and numerical simulations and are carried out for one specific application at a time. In this paper, we present Traq, a principled approach towards estimating the quantum speedup of classical programs fully automatically and with provable guarantees. It consists of a classical language that includes high-level primitives amenable to quantum speedups, a cost analysis, and a compilation to low-level quantum programs. Our cost analysis upper bounds the complexity of the resulting quantum program in a fine-grained way: it captures non-asymptotic information and is sensitive to the input of the program (rather than providing worst-case costs). We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation and a case study inspired by AND-OR trees.</description>

      <title>The entropic coherence is a necessary resource for non-energy preserving gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the task of implementing non-energy preserving gates (NEPG) on a finite-dimensional system S via an energy-preserving interaction with an external battery B. We prove that the entropic coherence of the battery (an instance of the relative entropy of resource) is a necessary resource for this task, and find a lower bound on its minimum amount that has to be present in the battery to be able to implement NEPGs with a fixed desired precision. An immediate corollary is that any finite-dimensional battery is doomed to a certain minimal error in the gate implementation task. Moreover, under assumptions on the density of energy levels in the battery Hamiltonian, our main results imply additional lower bounds on the minimal amount of energy and quantum Fisher information required to implement any gate. We show that these bounds can be stronger than the universal bounds previously established in the literature.</description>

      <title>Measuring Less to Learn More: Quadratic Speedup in learning Nonlinear Properties of Quantum Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental task in quantum information science is to measure nonlinear functionals of quantum states, such as $\mathrm{Tr}(\rho^k O)$. Intuitively, one expects that computing a $k$-th order quantity generally requires $O(k)$ copies of the state $\rho$, and we rigorously establish this lower bound under sample access to $\rho$. Surprisingly, this limitation can be overcome when one has purified access via a unitary that prepares a purification of $\rho$, a scenario naturally arising in quantum simulation and computation. In this setting, we find a different lower bound of $\Theta(\sqrt{k})$, and present a quantum algorithm that achieves this bound, demonstrating a quadratic advantage over sample-based methods. The key technical innovation lies in a designed quantum algorithm and optimal polynomial approximation theory -- specifically, Chebyshev polynomial approximations tailored to the boundary behavior of power functions. Our results unveil a fundamental distinction between sample and purified access to quantum states, with broad implications for estimating quantum entropies and quantum Fisher information, realizing quantum virtual distillation and cooling, and evaluating other multiple nonlinear quantum observables with classical shadows.</description>

      <title>Superstrong Dynamics and Chiral Emission of a Giant Atom in a Structured Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich quantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian quantum models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with long-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center, while suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.</description>

      <title>A Spin-Based Pathway to Testing the Quantum Nature of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key open problem in physics is the correct way to combine gravity (described by general relativity) with everything else (described by quantum mechanics). This problem suggests that general relativity and possibly also quantum mechanics need fundamental corrections. Most physicists expect that gravity should be quantum in character, but gravity is fundamentally different to the other forces because it alone is described by spacetime geometry. Experiments are needed to test whether gravity, and hence space-time, is quantum or classical. We propose an experiment to test the quantum nature of gravity by checking whether gravity can entangle two micron-sized crystals. A pathway to this is to create macroscopic quantum superpositions of each crystal first using embedded spins and Stern-Gerlach forces. These crystals could be nanodiamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. The spins can subsequently be measured to witness the gravitationally generated entanglement. This is based on extensive theoretical feasibility studies and experimental progress in quantum technology. The eventual experiment will require a medium-sized consortium with excellent suppression of decoherence including vibrations and gravitational noise. In this white paper, we review the progress and plans towards realizing this. While implementing these plans, we will further explore the most macroscopic superpositions that are possible, which will test theories that predict a limit to this.</description>

      <title>The Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, which can be seen as energy- or state-storage devices exploiting coherence and other quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here we show that, when suitably engineered, environmental noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery. To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which provides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more importantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since the ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local noise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength of each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and stored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but stabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster charging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel combines both features. In the discharging stage, different noise channels lead to distinct release dynamics, showing that noise can paradoxically enhance and stabilize quantum battery operation.</description>

      <title>Sampling Continuous Quantum Dynamics from a Single Static State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum simulation is one of the most promising applications of modern quantum devices, accessible simulation times are fundamentally limited by finite coherence times due to omnipresent noise. Based on the ideas of relational dynamics/time and of exchanging time for space resources, we propose an approach to simulating quantum dynamics under general time-dependent Hamiltonians in continuous time, which aims to overcome this limitation by encoding the full dynamics in a single static quantum state. This is achieved by introducing auxiliary qubits, which play the role of a clock, and by tailoring their dynamics and interaction with the original system. As opposed to traditional methods, no short-time propagators, or approximations thereof, are required in our framework. We outline the preparation of a static global state of system and clock via a variational quantum-classical algorithm as well as the sampling of the system's dynamics by performing projective measurements on the clock. Finally, we provide an example of our approach in terms of a driven qubit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic quantum processors are a promising platform for quantum simulation of correlated fermionic matter. In this work, we study a hardware-efficient protocol for measuring complex expectation values of the time-evolution operator, commonly referred to as Loschmidt echoes, with fermions in an optical superlattice. We analyze the algorithm for the Fermi-Hubbard model at half-filling as well as at finite doping. The method relies on global quench dynamics and short imaginary time evolution, the latter being realized by architecture-tailored pulse sequences starting from a product state of plaquettes. Our numerical results show that complex Loschmidt echoes can be efficiently obtained for large many-body states over a broad spectral range. This allows one to measure spectral properties of the Fermi-Hubbard model, such as the local density of states, and paves the way for the study of finite-temperature properties in current fermionic quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum Frequency Conversion of Single Photons from a Tin-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamond tin-vacancy (SnV) centers are promising candidates for building quantum network nodes. However, their native photon emission at 619 nm is incompatible with metropolitan-scale networks operating at low-loss telecom wavelengths. To address this, we demonstrate highly efficient, low-noise quantum frequency conversion (QFC) of 619 nm photons to the telecom S-band at 1480 nm. The conversion process combines 619 nm photons with 1064 nm pump light in an actively stabilized cavity containing a bulk monocrystalline potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA) crystal. We achieve an internal (external) conversion efficiency of (48 +/- 3)% ((28 +/- 2)%) and a noise photon rate per wavelength of 2.2 +/- 0.9 cts/s/pm, which is spectrally flat in the investigated frequency range of 40 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the efficiency remains above 80% of its maximum over a frequency range of 70 GHz. Finally, we generate a string of photons from a single waveguide-embedded SnV center using a train of excitation pulses and send these through the QFC. After the QFC, we observe a string of telecom photons displaying the SnV lifetime, confirming successful conversion. These results represent a critical step towards metropolitan-scale fiber-based quantum networks using SnV centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the operating principle of a quantum sensor for electric fields based on networks of Rydberg atoms. The sensing mechanism exploits the dependence of the Rydberg blockade on the electric field, particularly in the vicinity of the F\"{o}rster resonance - the electric field can be measured through the variation in the size of the blockade radius across the network of Rydberg atoms. Specifically, we track the dynamics of Rydberg excitations in systems of various spatial structures, subjected to different electric field configurations, to monitor the connection between the field and blockade. We also use the density-density correlator to analyse spatially varying (inhomogeneous) electric fields and relate these correlators to the applied fields.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Syntheses via the V-type Three-Level Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state engineering operating with photons is a key enabler of major scientific breakthroughs and future quantum technologies. Its primary obstacle, however, is decoherence often caused by spontaneous emission, which is inherently difficult to control. In contrast, superradiance offers a more controllable alternative. The temporal dynamics of superradiance can be tuned via external experimental parameters, unlike those of spontaneous emission. Incorporating superradiance into quantum state engineering could therefore provide more accessible control over quantum systems. Motivated by this, we present a theoretical model for an ensemble of atoms in a V - type three - level configuration. Our numerical data are analyzed against key superradiance characteristics. The system successively emits a pair of superradiance pulses, effectively synthesizing the dynamically decoupled sub - ensembles into a single macroscopic ensemble involving all atoms. To our knowledge, this process, which we term superradiant synthesis, is demonstrated here for the first time. These findings offer new insights for practical quantum state engineering, particularly in enabling syntheses of macroscopic quantum sub-systems.</description>

      <title>Photon emission without quantum jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When modelling photon emission, we often assume that emitters experience random quantum jumps. When a quantum jump occurs the emitter transitions suddenly into a lower energy level, while spontaneously generating a single photon. However, this point of view is misleading when modelling, for example, quantum optical systems which rely on far-field interference effects for applications like distributed quantum computing and quantum sensing. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of an emitter in the free radiation field can be described without imposing quantum jumps by instead using a Schroedinger equation based on a locally-acting Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our approach is nevertheless consistent with quantum optical master equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.</description>

      <title>QUBO-based training for VQAs on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum annealers provide an effective framework for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. This work presents a novel methodology for training Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) by reformulating the parameter optimization task as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Unlike traditional gradient-based methods, our approach directly leverages the Hamiltonian of the chosen VQA ansatz and employs an adaptive, metaheuristic optimization scheme. This optimization strategy provides a rich set of configurable parameters which enables the adaptation to specific problem characteristics and available computational resources. The proposed framework is generalizable to arbitrary Hamiltonians and integrates a recursive refinement strategy to progressively approximate high-quality solutions.
  Experimental evaluations demonstrate the feasibility of the method and its ability to significantly reduce computational overhead compared to classical and evolutionary optimizers, while achieving comparable or superior solution quality. These findings suggest that quantum annealers can serve as a scalable alternative to classical optimizers for VQA training, particularly in scenarios affected by barren plateaus and noisy gradient estimates, and open new possibilities for hybrid quantum gate - quantum annealing - classical optimization models in near-term quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The curious case of "XOR repetition" of monogamy-of-entanglement games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider "decision" variants of a monogamy-of-entanglement game by Tomamichel, Fehr, Kaniewski, and Wehner [New Journal of Physics '13]. In its original "search" variant, Alice prepares a (possibly entangled) state on registers $\mathsf{ABC}$; register $\mathsf{A}$, consisting of $n$ qubits, is sent to a Referee, while $\mathsf{B}$ and $\mathsf{C}$ are sent to Bob and Charlie; the Referee then measures each qubit in the standard or Hadamard basis (chosen uniformly at random). The basis choices are sent to Bob and Charlie, whose goal is to simultaneously guess the Referee's $n$-bit outcome string $x$. Tomamichel et al. show that the optimal winning probability is $\cos^{2n} {(\frac{\pi}{8})}$, following a perfect parallel repetition theorem. We consider the following "decision" variants of this game:
  - Variant 1, "XOR repetition": Bob and Charlie's goal is to guess the XOR of all the bits of $x$. Ananth et al. [Asiacrypt '24] conjectured that the optimal advantage over random guessing decays exponentially in $n$. Surprisingly, we show that this conjecture is false, and, in fact, there is no decay at all: there exists a strategy that wins with probability $\cos^2{(\frac{\pi}{8})} \approx 0.85$ for any $n$.
  - Variant 2, "Goldreich-Levin": The Referee additionally samples a uniformly random $n$-bit string $r$ that is sent to Bob and Charlie along with the basis choices. Their goal is to guess the parity of $r\cdot x$. We show that the optimal advantage over random guessing decays exponentially in $n$ for the restricted class of adversaries that do not share entanglement. A similar result was already shown by Champion et al. and \c{C}akan et al.; we give a more direct proof. Additionally, we put forward a reasonably concrete conjecture that is equivalent to exponential decay for general adversaries.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Localizable Multipartite Quantum Measurements from Pauli Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the structure of entangled quantum states is relatively well understood, the characterization of entangled measurements, especially in multipartite and high-dimensional settings, remains far less developed. In this work, we introduce a general approach to construct highly symmetric, locally encodable orthonormal measurement bases, as orbits of a single fiducial state under tensor-product actions of Pauli subgroups. This framework recovers the Elegant Joint Measurement-a two-qubit measurement whose local marginals form a regular tetrahedron on the Bloch sphere-as a special case, and we extend the construction to both more systems and higher dimensions. We analyze the entanglement cost required to implement these measurements locally via the Clifford hierarchy and use this criterion to classify them. We show how the symmetry of our constructions allows us to characterize their localizability, which is generally a challenging problem, and to identify certain classes of measurement bases that are efficiently localizable. Our approach offers a systematic toolkit for designing entangled measurements with rich symmetry and implementability properties.</description>

      <title>The Multiqubit Elegant Joint Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Elegant Joint Measurement (EJM) is a highly symmetric, partially entangled two-qubit measurement whose local marginals form a regular tetrahedron on the Bloch sphere and which has a low entanglement cost for local implementation. It plays a central role in quantum networks exhibiting nonclassical correlations and serves as a paradigmatic example of an entangled measurement with local structure. Despite its significance, generalizing the EJM beyond two qubits has remained unresolved. Here, we extend the EJM to the multipartite setting by identifying all tetrahedrally symmetric, efficiently localizable multiqubit bases. For two qubits, these criteria uniquely select the EJM. For three or more, they yield a discrete set of equivalence classes, reflecting the richer structure of multiparticle entanglement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tomography of Suspended Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with multiple readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Enhanced Tripartite Coupling in Quantum Nonlinear Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong and controllable tripartite interactions play a pivotal role in quantum information and nonlinear quantum optics, yet challenging to realize. In this work, we propose a hybrid system consisting of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center coupled to Kerr magnons (magnons with Kerr nonlinearity) in two yttrium-iron-garnet spheres. By adiabatically eliminating the ground state of the NV qutrit in the dispersive regime, an effective tripartite interaction among magnons and an NV qubit encoded in its excited states is obtained. In the strong driving limit, Kerr magnons can be linearized and give rise to degenerate parametric amplification for squeezing magnons. As a result, both the tripartite interaction and cooperativity are exponentially enhanced twice, which is about $\exp(\xi)$ times than schemes only involving single-squeezing. Hence, our proposal is more experimentally feasible because modest squeezing parameter is sufficient. With this amplified tripartite coupling strength, the system dynamics are greatly accelerated, leading to fast generation of tripartite entanglement. In addition, noise-resilient perfect magnon blockade can be achieved, well predicted by both the analytical approach and numerical simulation with quantum master equation. Our results suggest that the NV center represents a promising interface for engineering many-body interactions in quantum magnonics, offering a versatile platform for exploring fundamental quantum phenomena such as entanglement and correlations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating BP-OSD Decoder for QLDPC Codes with Local Syndrome-Based Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the high error rate of qubits, detecting and correcting errors is essential for achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are one of the most promising quantum error correction (QEC) methods due to their high encoding rates. Belief Propagation-Ordered Statistics Decoding (BP-OSD) is the state-of-the-art decoder for QLDPC codes, but it suffers from high decoding latency. We find from experiments that a large portion of this latency originates from the iterative BP stage, making BP runtime reduction a key optimization target.
  In this paper, we propose a lightweight preprocessing step that utilizes local syndrome patterns to detect likely trivial error events and feed them as hints into BP-OSD. These hints reduce the number of BP iterations and the overall decoding time. On Bivariate Bicycle codes, the proposed method achieves more than an 80% reduction in BP iterations and total decoding time for the $[[144,12,12]]$ code at a physical error rate of 0.05%, while maintaining the original logical error rate of BP-OSD.</description>

      <title>CNOT Oriented Synthesis for Small-Scale Boolean Functions Using Spatial Structures of Parallelotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01912v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has garnered significant interest for its potential to achieve exponential speedups over classical approaches. However, in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, quantum circuit scalability remains limited by gate fidelity and qubit counts, restricting physical implementations to small-scale circuits. While prior work has explored logic network structures for quantum circuit synthesis, these methods often neglect the spatial structure intrinsic to Boolean functions. In this paper, we leverage this spatial structure, encoded by parallelotopes embedded in the hypercube defined by the Boolean function, to access a broader optimization space, enhancing synthesis efficiency and reducing circuit complexity. We propose the Spatial Structure-based Hypercube Reduction~(SSHR), a novel synthesis method tailored for small-scale Boolean functions ($\leq 8$). SSHR extracts global spatial features to minimize the use of Multi-Control Toffoli (MCT) gates. To further exploit spatial correlations, we introduce two variants: SSHR-H employs heuristic functions to accelerate synthesis runtime, while SSHR-I integrates an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver to maximize spatial structure utilization. Our approach outperforms existing techniques in small-scale circuit synthesis, achieving 56\% and 81\% reductions in CNOT gate counts compared to the Exclusive Sum-of-Products (ESOP) and Xor-And-Inverter Graph (XAG) methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>An operator approach to the Madelung-Bohm continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the probability continuity equation within the Madelung-Bohm framework, assuming a separable phase expressed as $S(x,t) = Q(x)\dot{\nu}(t) + \mu(t)$. Using operator methods, we reformulate the wave function's amplitude into a form that is more practical for application to any given initial condition. This results in the function $F(x,t)$, which characterizes the wavefunction's amplitude, with $F$ being the transformation of the position operator via a squeeze-like operator. To demonstrate how this result can be applied, we examine two scenarios: one where the external potential is zero, causing the dynamics to originate only from the Bohm potential, and another where the form of $F$ mirrors the characteristics of wave propagation within optical waveguide arrays. In the second scenario, it is notable that the amplitude, phase, and potentials might become complex yet still comply with the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Statistical Witness Indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical witness indistinguishability is a relaxation of statistical zero-knowledge which guarantees that the transcript of an interactive proof reveals no information about which valid witness the prover used to generate it. In this paper we define and initiate the study of QSWI, the class of problems with quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proofs.
  Using inherently quantum techniques from Kobayashi (TCC 2008), we prove that any problem with an honest-verifier quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proof has a 3-message public-coin malicious-verifier quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proof. There is no known analogue of this result for classical statistical witness indistinguishability. As a corollary, our result implies SWI is contained in QSWI.
  Additionally, we extend the work of Bitansky et al. (STOC 2023) to show that quantum batch proofs imply quantum statistically witness indistinguishable proofs with inverse-polynomial witness indistinguishability error.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pontus-Mpemba Effects in Real and Imaginary-time Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect (QPME) is a counterintuitive phenomenon wherein a quantum system relaxes more rapidly through a two-step evolution protocol than through direct evolution under a symmetric Hamiltonian alone. In this protocol, the system first evolves under a symmetry-breaking Hamiltonian and then switches to a symmetric one. We demonstrate that QPME occurs under both real-time and imaginary-time dynamics with respect to $U(1)$-symmetry. Using tilted ferromagnetic initial states, we demonstrate that a transient asymmetric evolution significantly accelerates thermalization or convergence to the ground state for both real-time and imaginary-time evolutions, respectively. The effect is pronounced for small tilt angles, while larger tilts or antiferromagnetic initial states suppress it. Numerical evidence across different system sizes confirms the robustness of QPME, demonstrating its stability in the thermodynamic limit. This finding not only deepens our fundamental understanding of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena but also opens new possibilities for accelerating quantum simulation and computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boson sampling is a key candidate for demonstrating quantum advantage, and has already yielded significant advances in quantum simulation, machine learning, and graph theory. In this work, a unification and extension of distinct forms of boson sampling is developed. The devised protocol merges discrete-variable scattershot boson sampling with continuous-variable Gaussian boson sampling. Thereby, it is rendered possible to harness the complexity of more interesting states, such as squeezed photons, in advanced sampling protocols. A generating function formalism is developed for the joint description of multiphoton and multimode light undergoing Gaussian transformations. The resulting analytical tools enable one to explore interfaces of different photonic quantum-information-processing platforms. A numerical simulation of unified sampling is carried out, benchmarking its performance, complexity, and scalability. Entanglement is characterized to exemplify the generation of quantum correlations from the nonlinear interactions of a unified sampler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If the excitation of a system of quantized fields with a given set of quantum numbers does not exist, the amplitude of the triggering of the source is zero. A system with a source of two photons in a singlet state and two photon detectors is considered in detail. It is shown that the condition of operation of one detector with a given direction of photon polarization uniquely determines the adequate choice of direction and polarization for the second detector. This conclusion is in accordance with the laws of motion and conservation of quantum numbers of excitations in a system of quantized fields.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis of MDI-QKD in Turbulent Free-Space Polarization Channels-A Composite Channel Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence poses a significant challenge to free-space measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (FSO MDI-QKD) by inducing polarization decoherence and depolarization, which degrade the secret key rate (SKR). In this paper, we propose a unified depolarizing-dephasing channel model for turbulence-induced polarization decoherence in FSO MDI-QKD. This model consolidates phase perturbations, Gaussian beam spreading, beam drift, aperture truncation, and scintillation into closed-form parameters: depolarization factor, decoherence factor, and detection probability. By mapping turbulence to a von Mises-Fisher/Watson-distributed SU(2) rotation, we derive an analytic SKR expression compatible with existing MDI-QKD security analyses. The model excels in clear, overcast, and hazy weather conditions, offering computational efficiency and experimental verifiability for real-time link adaptation. Numerical simulations, illustrated on a ground-to-satellite free-space link, confirm its accuracy, enabling robust physical layer design for global-scale MDI-QKD networks.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient and Broadband Optical Delay Line towards a Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-efficiency, free space optical delay line utilizing a nested multipass cell architecture. This design supports extended optical paths with low loss, aided by custom broadband dielectric coating that provides high reflectivity across a wide spectral bandwidth. The cell is characterized using polarization-entangled photon pairs, with signal photons routed through the delay line and idler photons used as timing reference. Quantum state tomography performed on the entangled pair reveals entanglement preservation with a fidelity of $99.6(9)\%$ following a single-transit delay of up to $687$~ns, accompanied by a photon retrieval efficiency of $95.390(5)%$. The delay is controllable and can be set between $1.8$~ns to $687$~ns in $\sim12.6$~ns increments. The longest delay and wide spectral bandwidth result in a time-bandwidth product of $3.87\times 10^7$. These results position this delay line as a strong candidate for all-optical quantum memories and synchronization modules for scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum state tomography with Chebyshev polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing shows promise for addressing computationally intensive problems but is constrained by the exponential resource requirements of general quantum state tomography (QST), which fully characterizes quantum states through parameter estimation. We introduce the QST with Chebyshev polynomials, an approximate tomography method for pure quantum states encoding complex-valued functions. This method reformulates tomography as the estimation of Chebyshev expansion coefficients, expressed as inner products between the target quantum state and Chebyshev basis functions, measured using the Hadamard test circuit. By treating the truncation order of the Chebyshev polynomials as a controllable parameter, the method provides a practical balance between efficiency and accuracy. For quantum states encoding functions dominated by large-scale features, such as those representing fluid flow fields, appropriate truncation enables faithful reconstruction of the dominant components via quantum circuits with linear depth, while keeping both measurement repetitions and post-processing independent of qubit count, in contrast to the exponential scaling of full measurement-based QST methods. Validation on analytic functions and numerically generated flow-field data demonstrates accurate reconstruction and effective extraction of large-scale features, indicating the method's suitability for systems governed by macroscopic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Counting gauge-invariant states with matter fields and finite gauge groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge theories with finite gauge groups have applications to quantum simulation and quantum gravity. Recently, the exact number of gauge-invariant states was computed for pure gauge theories on arbitrary lattices. In this work, we generalize this counting to include the case of scalar and fermionic matter, as well as various kinds of boundary conditions. As a byproduct, we consider several related questions, such as the implementation of charge conjugation for a generic finite group. These results are relevant for resource estimation and also as a crosscheck when working in a gauge-invariant basis.</description>

      <title>Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Observing Two-Particle Correlation Dynamics in Tunable Superconducting Bose-Hubbard Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and propagation of quantum correlations are central to understanding many dynamical properties of quantum systems, yet their precise experimental control and characterization remain a key challenge. Here we experimentally study the two-particle correlation dynamics via quantum walks in superconducting Bose-Hubbard qutrit arrays, with tunable on-site interaction $U$ realized by Floquet engineering. Quantum walks show the characteristic change from bosonic bunching to fermionic antibunching with increasing $U$. The two-particle entanglement and quantum correlation dynamics, as measured by negativity and quantum discord, are investigated. We find that depending on the initial state, the propagation of entanglement can be strongly suppressed with increasing $U$, while that of quantum discord exhibits considerably larger amplitude; or both of them appear insensitive to $U$. Furthermore, the forms of entanglement are found to persist throughout particle walks for $U =$ 0 and it is generally not the case when $U$ increases. Our work highlights the role of interaction in shaping quantum dynamics and extends the realm of simulating correlated quantum systems with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Indefinite causal order in cavity quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indefinite causal order (ICO) has the potential to be a new resource for quantum information processing. In most of its experiments, ICO has been investigated in a photonic platform. Here we investigate ICO in a cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) system composed of two cavities. Our results show that ICO can create entanglement between two distant cavity fields that never interact directly, and for the case of two cavity fields in the vacuum state, ICO presents an advantage over the fixed-order scenario by always generating large entanglement between the two cavity fields. Furthermore, we show that ICO can interchange one photon between both cavities with a total probability equal to one, without changing the quantum state of the atom, something that is impossible to achieve when two cQED systems are in well-defined order. Our results show the potential that ICO can offer in the paradigm of light-matter interaction for coherently controlling atom-field observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02211v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear optics (LO) prohibits certain transformations. In this paper, we study the conditions for a computation to be possible in LO. We find that there are finitely many polynomials such that each of these polynomials evaluates to the same value on two photonic states if and only if there is a LO circuit transforming one of these states into the other. The proof is non-constructive, so we then focus on methods to find such polynomials.</description>

      <title>Optimizing digital quantum simulation of open quantum lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body systems arising in condensed matter physics and quantum optics inevitably couple to the environment and need to be modelled as open quantum systems. While near-optimal algorithms have been developed for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, algorithms for their open system counterparts remain less well investigated. We address the problem of simulating geometrically local many-body open quantum systems interacting with a stationary Gaussian environment. Under a smoothness assumption on the system-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a model with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\delta$ in the system-state with $\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ gates, $\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show that, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit depth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system size $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these algorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local observables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the limiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose two algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated Hamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic gate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of the required number of geometrically local gates.</description>

      <title>Optimal distillation of photonic indistinguishability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imperfect photons' indistinguishability limits the performance of photonic quantum communication and computation . Distillation protocols, inspired by entanglement purification, enhance photons' indistinguishability by leveraging quantum interference in linear optical circuits. In this work, we present a three-photon distillation protocol optimized to achieve the maximum visibility gain, which requires consideration of multi-photon effects such as collective photonic phases. We employ interferometers with the minimum number of modes, optimizing also over the protocol's success probability. The developed protocol is experimentally validated with a platform featuring a demultiplexed quantum dot source interfaced with a programmable eight-mode laser-written integrated photonic processor. We achieve indistinguishability distillation with limited photonic resources and for several multi-photon distinguishability scenarios. This work helps to strengthen the role of distillation as a practical tool for photon-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Approaching transform-limited linewidths in telecom-wavelength transitions of ungated quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02320v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>

      <title>Floquet-informed Learning of Periodically Driven Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing time-periodic Hamiltonians is pivotal for validating and controlling driven quantum platforms, yet prevailing and unadjusted reconstruction methods demand dense time-domain sampling and heavy post-processing. We introduce a scalable Floquet-informed learning algorithm that represents the Hamiltonian as a truncated Fourier series and recasts parameter estimation as a compact linear inverse problem in the Floquet band picture. The algorithm is well-suited to problems satisfying mild smoothness/band-limiting. In this regime, its sample and runtime complexities scale polynomially with the Fourier cutoff, time resolution, and the number of unknown coefficients. For local Hamiltonian models, the coefficients grows polynomially with system size, yielding at most polylogarithmic dependence on the Hilbert-space dimension. Furthermore, numerical experiments on one- and two-dimensional Ising and Heisenberg lattices show fast convergence to time resolution and robustness to higher-order perturbations. An adaptive rule learns the cutoff of Fourier series, removing the need to set known truncation \textit{a priori}. These features enable practical certification and benchmarking of periodically driven platforms with rapidly decaying higher-order content, and extend naturally to near-periodic drives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a realistic implementation of a quantum engine powered by a phaseonium gas of coherently prepared three-level atoms -- where quantum coherence acts as a thermodynamic resource. Using a collision model framework for phaseonium-cavity interactions and cavity optomechanics, we construct a full engine cycle based on two non-thermal reservoirs, each characterized by coherence-induced effective temperatures. This configuration enhances the efficiency of a simple optomechanical engine operating beyond standard thermal paradigms. We further address scalability by coupling a second cavity in cascade configuration, where the same phaseonium gas drives both cycles. Our results demonstrate the operational viability of coherence-driven quantum engines and their potential for future thermodynamic applications.</description>

The input and ouput quantum states are provided to the network, which is trained to approximate the output state of a given quantum algorithm. To ensure that the fundamental property of unitarity is preserved throughout the training process, we employ optimization in Stiefel Manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The titanium in-diffused lithium niobate waveguide platform is well-established for reliable prototyping and packaging of many quantum photonic components at room temperature. Nevertheless, compatibility with certain quantum light sources and superconducting detectors requires operation under cryogenic conditions. We characterize alterations in phase-matching and mode guiding of a non-degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion process emitting around 1556 nm and 950 nm, under cryogenic conditions. Despite the effects of pyroelectricity and photorefraction, the spectral properties match our theoretical model. Nevertheless, these effects cause small but significant variations within and between cooling cycles. These measurements provide a first benchmark against which other nonlinear photonic integration platforms, such as thin-film lithium niobate, can be compared.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Explicit Block Encoding of Finite Difference Discretizations of the Laplacian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data input model is a fundamental component of every quantum algorithm, as its efficiency is crucial for achieving potential speed-ups over classical methods. For quantum linear algebra tasks that utilize quantum eigenvalue or singular value transformations, block encoding is the established technique for accessing matrix data. A key application of this is solving partial differential equations, where the Laplacian operator and its finite difference discretization serve as foundational examples. In this paper, we present an efficient and explicit block encoding method that enhances existing approaches in key aspects. We detail the construction of the quantum algorithm and illustrate how it leverages the unique structure of finite difference discretizations. Furthermore, we analytically derive the scaling of the sub-normalization factor and of the success probability of the block encoding with respect to the problem dimension, the grid width of the finite difference grid and the regularity of the exact solution, and we give resource estimates.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Compact Wavefunctions from Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent direction in quantum computing for molecular electronic structure sees the use of quantum devices as configuration sampling machines integrated within high-performance computing (HPC) platforms. This appeals to the strengths of both the quantum and classical hardware; where state-sampling is classically hard, the quantum computer can provide computational advantage in the selection of high quality configuration subspaces, while the final molecular energies are evaluated by solving an interaction matrix on HPC and is therefore not corrupted by hardware noise. In this work, we present an algorithm that leverages stochastic Hamiltonian time evolution in Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction (QSCI), with multireference perturbation theory capturing missed correlations outside the configuration subspace. The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising 42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy curve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis set, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length. In the regime of strong correlation we obtain energies comparable to Heatbath Configuration Interaction, but with a configuration space more than 200 times smaller, providing the first evidence that QSCI can produce more compact representations of the ground state wavefunction compared with conventional heuristics. This result is achieved with a configuration sampling scheme that predicts likely single and double excitations to generate connected configurations based on the orbital occupancies of a time-evolved quantum state.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\"ossbauer spectroscopy is widely used in biochemistry, geology, and solid-state physics to obtain structural information on materials. Here, we extend this technique into the optical range using a vacuum ultraviolet laser to probe the low-energy nuclear transitions of thorium-229, doped in calcium fluoride crystals. We discover four distinct doping sites for the thorium ions, determine the characteristic electric field gradients emerging in the interaction with the host crystal, and identify the microscopic structure of the two dominant configurations.

      <title>LLM-QUBO: An End-to-End Framework for Automated QUBO Transformation from Natural Language Problem Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely hindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem descriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To address these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO, that automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically generating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware limitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition method. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial complex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly structured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated QUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical solvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the framework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a synergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing, addressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem. This automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a viable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for large-scale, real-world optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Enhanced R\'{e}nyi Entropy-Based Post-Quantum Key Agreement with Provable Security and Information-Theoretic Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced post-quantum key agreement protocol based on R\'{e}nyi entropy, addressing vulnerabilities in the original construction while preserving information-theoretic security properties. We develop a theoretical framework leveraging entropy-preserving operations and secret-shared verification to achieve provable security against quantum adversaries. Through entropy amplification techniques and quantum-resistant commitments, the protocol establishes $2^{128}$ quantum security guarantees under the quantum random oracle model. Key innovations include a confidentiality-preserving verification mechanism using distributed polynomial commitments, tightened min-entropy bounds with guaranteed non-negativity, and composable security proofs in the quantum universal composability framework. Unlike computational approaches, our method provides information-theoretic security without hardness assumptions while maintaining polynomial complexity. Theoretical analysis demonstrates resilience against known quantum attack vectors, including Grover-accelerated brute force and quantum memory attacks. The protocol achieves parameterization for 128-bit quantum security with efficient $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ communication complexity. Extensions to secure multiparty computation and quantum network applications are established, providing a foundation for long-term cryptographic security. All security claims are derived from mathematical proofs; this theoretical work presents no experimental validation.</description>

      <title>SU(2) symmetry of spatiotemporal Gaussian modes propagating in the isotropic dispersive media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The far-field intensity distribution of spatiotemporal Laguerre-Gaussian (STLG) modes propagating in free space exhibits a multi-petal pattern analogous to that observed in tilted Hermite-Gaussian modes. Here, we show that this phenomenon can be explained by the SU(2) symmetry of spatiotemporal Gaussian modes, which can support the irreducible representation of SU(2) group and enable the construction of the spatiotemporal model Poincar\'e sphere. We have also derived analytical expressions for the STLG mode with an arbitrary radial and angular indices propagating in the isotropic media. The propagation dynamics can be understood as a unitary transformation generated by a conserved quantity, where the rotation angle is exactly the intermodal Gouy phase of the spatiotemporal modes in the same order subspace. This spatiotemporal Gouy phase depends on the ellipticity of the wave packets and the group velocity dispersion (GVD) of the media. The phase, as a function of propagation distance, is categorized into three distinct regimes: normal dispersion, anomalous dispersion, and zero dispersion. Interestingly, in the regime of anomalous dispersion, the non-monotonic behavior induces to both distortion and revival of the intensity distribution, thereby establishing a phase-locked mechanism that is analogous to the Talbot effect.</description>

      <title>Solving Optimal Power Flow using a Variational Quantum Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a large-scale optimization problem that is central in the operation of electric power systems. Although it can be posed as a nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic program, the complexity of modern-day power grids raises scalability and optimality challenges. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving the OPF. We encode primal variables through the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables through the probability mass function associated with a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. An OPF solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting primal variables so that OPF observables are expressed in a banded form, allowing them to be measured efficiently. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</description>

Abstract: This work focuses on the study of the spectral problem for Dirac materials immersed in position-dependent magnetic and electric fields. To achieve this, the system of differential equations satisfied by the eigenfunction components of the Hamiltonian has been decoupled, and the solutions for some specific cases have been analyzed using Heun functions, which provide us with a quantization relation and allow us to determine the solutions for the bound states.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Genuine multi-entropy, dihedral invariants and Lifshitz theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-invariants are local unitary invariants of state replicas introduced as potential new probes of multipartite entanglement and correlations in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we investigate two multi-invariants for tripartite pure states, namely multi-entropy and dihedral invariant. We compute the (genuine) multi-entropy for groundstates of Lifshitz theories, and obtain its analytical continuation to noninteger values of R\'enyi index. We show that the genuine multi-entropy can be expressed in terms of mutual information and logarithmic negativity. For general tripartite pure states, we demonstrate that dihedral invariants are directly related to R\'enyi reflected entropies. In particular, we show that the dihedral permutations of replicas are equivalent to the reflected construction, or alternatively to the realignment of density matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <title>Electronic frictional effects near metal surfaces with strong correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic friction-Langevin dynamics (EF-LD) offers a simplified framework for describing nonadiabatic effects at metal surfaces, particularly in electrochemical and molecular electronic applications. We investigate the electronic friction behavior for the Hubbard-Holstein model using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) theory. We show that electron-electron interactions lead to the formation of two energy levels in the impurity, resulting in two peaks in the electronic friction at the resonances of electron attachment or detachment with the metal's Fermi level. We further benchmark our results against mean field theory (MFT) and exact diagonalization (ED). The results calculated by ED and DMRG show strong agreement at high temperatures, suggesting the results from DMRG are reliable; however, at low temperatures, ED exhibits significant deviations relative to DMRG due to the finite-size limitations inherent in ED calculations. MFT completely fails to recover Fermi resonance in electronic friction. Moreover, we investigate the dynamics of the electronic friction using EF-LD. Simulations reveal differences between the electronic population and kinetic energy dynamics predicted by MFT and DMRG approaches, suggesting that MFT approach is unreliable for nonadiabatic dynamics of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Parametrically Driven Superradiance of an Interacting Tavis-Cummings Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the superradiant transition of a generalized Tavis-Cummings model, where a number of two-level qubits are coupled to a dissipative cavity. The cavity is coherently driven through a parametric medium, and all-to-all interactions between the qubits are introduced. While the nonlinear gain from the parametric drive breaks the U(1) symmetry of the standard Tavis-Cummings model, thus giving rise to superradiance with squeezed cavity fields, we show that the interactions impact the collective excitations and significantly modify the superradiant transition. Insights to the superradiant phase transitions, as well as the interaction effects, are obtained through effective models involving only a handful of low-lying collective states, under which the steady-state phase diagram of the hybrid system is faithfully reproduced. Our study is relevant to Rydberg-atom arrays coupled to a parametrically driven cavity, where the long-range interactions derive from the dipole-dipole interatomic interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in both classical and quantum electronics. One approach to realizing passive non-reciprocal microwave devices is through capacitive coupling between external electrodes and materials exhibiting non-reciprocal conductance. In this work, we develop an analytic framework that captures the response of such devices in the presence of dissipation while accounting for the full AC dynamics of the material. Our results yield an effective circuit model that accurately describes the device response in experimentally relevant regimes even at small dissipation levels. Furthermore, our analysis reveals counterpropagating features arising from the intrinsic AC response of the material that could be exploited to dynamically switch the non-reciprocity of the device, opening pathways for tunable non-reciprocal microwave technologies.</description>

      <title>Dissipation suppression for an Unruh-DeWitt battery with a reflecting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of open quantum systems, we study the dynamics of an accelerated quantum battery (QB), modeled as an Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a real massless scalar quantum field. The QB is driven by an external classical force acting as a charger. A major challenge in this setup is the environment-induced decoherence, which leads to energy dissipation of the QB. Accelerated motion exacerbates this dissipation, manifesting effects analogous to those experienced by a static QB in a thermal bath in free space, consistent with the Unruh effect. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a reflecting boundary in a space, which modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field and leads to a position-dependent suppression of dissipation for the Unruh-DeWitt QB. Our analysis reveals that as the QB approaches the boundary, the relevant dissipation is significantly reduced. In particular, when the QB is placed extremely close to the boundary, the dissipation is nearly eliminated, as if the QB were a closed system. Furthermore, we identify a characteristic length scale associated with the acceleration of QB. When the distance between the QB and the boundary is much smaller than this scale, the boundary effectively suppresses dissipation, and this suppression effect becomes identical for both an accelerated QB and a static QB in a thermal bath. Conversely, when the distance is beyond this scale, the suppression effect weakens and manifests a significant difference between these two cases. Our findings demonstrate the potential of boundary-induced modifications in vacuum fluctuations to effectively suppress dissipation, offering valuable insights for optimizing QB performance. This work paves the way for the development of high-efficiency quantum energy storage systems in the relativistic framework.</description>

      <title>Observation of moir\'e trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\'e superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\'e-pocket to intra-moir\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\'e trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\'e trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</description>

Abstract: We study the beyond-mean-field Josephson dynamics of the relative phase between two coupled macroscopic quantum systems. Using a covariant background field method, we derive the one-loop only-phase quantum effective action and the corresponding equation of motion for the quantum average of the phase. These analytical results are benchmarked against the exact quantum dynamics of the two-site Bose-Hubbard model, demonstrating a relevant improvement over the standard mean-field predictions across a wide range of interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum-based QoE Optimization in Advanced Cellular Networks: Integration and Cloud Gaming Use Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the integration of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Quantum-Inspired (QI) techniques for optimizing end-to-end (E2E) network services in telecommunication systems, particularly focusing on 5G networks and beyond. The application of QML and QI algorithms is investigated, comparing their performance with classical Machine Learning (ML) approaches. The present study employs a hybrid framework combining quantum and classical computing leveraging the strengths of QML and QI, without the penalty of quantum hardware availability. This is particularized for the optimization of the Quality of Experience (QoE) over cellular networks. The framework comprises an estimator for obtaining the expected QoE based on user metrics, service settings, and cell configuration, and an optimizer that uses the estimation to choose the best cell and service configuration. Although the approach is applicable to any QoE-based network management, its implementation is particularized for the optimization of network configurations for Cloud Gaming services. Then, it is evaluated via performance metrics such as accuracy and model loading and inference times for the estimator, and time to solution and solution score for the optimizer. The results indicate that QML models achieve similar or superior accuracy to classical ML models for estimation, while decreasing inference and loading times. Furthermore, potential for better performance is observed for higher-dimensional data, highlighting promising results for higher complexity problems. Thus, the results demonstrate the promising potential of QML in advancing network optimization, although challenges related to data availability and integration complexities between quantum and classical ML are identified as future research lines.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) corrections to energy levels in muonic atoms are studied systematically across the periodic table. Two nuclear charge distribution models have been considered, with partly analytical solution for an homogeneously charged sphere model and direct numerical integration for a Fermi nuclear charge distribution. Our comparison reveals a good agreement between both approaches with differences typically below a few percent. The magnitude of HVP corrections increases with nuclear charge, displaying irregularities that correlate directly with the non-monotonic behavior of nuclear radii. Despite strong relativistic effects at high $Z$, the ratio of hadronic to muonic vacuum polarization remains remarkably stable, deviating by less than $10\%$ from the established $67\%$ non-relativistic benchmark value</description>

      <title>Quantum Petri Nets with Event Structure semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Petri nets provide a canonical model of concurrency, with unfolding semantics linking nets, occurrence nets, and event structures. No comparable framework exists for quantum concurrency: existing ''quantum Petri nets'' lack rigorous concurrent and sound quantum semantics, analysis tools, and unfolding theory. We introduce Quantum Petri Nets (QPNs), Petri nets equipped with a quantum valuation compatible with the quantum event structure semantics of Clairambault, De Visme, and Winskel (2019). Our contributions are: (i) a local definition of Quantum Occurrence Nets (LQONs) compatible with quantum event structures, (ii) a construction of QPNs with a well-defined unfolding semantics, (iii) a compositional framework for QPNs. This establishes a semantically well grounded model of quantum concurrency, bridging Petri net theory and quantum programming.</description>

      <title>Perturbatively corrected ring-polymer instanton rate theory rigorously captures anharmonicity and deep tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a perturbatively-corrected instanton rate theory in the ring-polymer framework (RPI+PC), which significantly enhances the accuracy of instanton theory by using third and fourth derivatives of the potential to capture anharmonic effects. Instanton theory is a rigorous semiclassical method that extends transition-state theory by including quantum tunneling along a well-defined optimal tunneling pathway. However, the standard leading-order instanton theory (RPI) neglects anharmonicity perpendicular to this tunneling path. The RPI+PC method described here corrects this using only local information along the same instanton trajectory as the leading-order theory. Hence, RPI+PC does not require a global potential energy surface and is readily applicable in combination with ab initio electronic-structure methods. The derivation of the RPI+PC result is performed within the flux-correlation formalism using standard techniques from asymptotic analysis, and the final rate expression is shown to be independent of the choice of dividing surface. We demonstrate that RPI+PC represents a systematic improvement over RPI by analyzing its asymptotic properties in the semiclassical limit ($\hbar\to0$ with total thermal time $\tau^{\mathrm{tot}}=\beta\hbar$ kept constant) and illustrate its improved performance on a series of model systems for which exact results are available for comparison, including the collinear H+H$_2$ reaction and its isotopic variants.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Loschmidt echoes from operator growth in noisy quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of Loschmidt echoes in noisy quantum many-body systems without conservation laws. We first show that the operator Loschmidt echo in noisy unitary dynamics is equivalent to the operator norm of the corresponding dissipative dynamics upon noise averaging. We then analyze this quantity in two complementary ways, revealing universal dynamical behavior. First, we develop a heuristic picture for generic Floquet systems that connects Loschmidt echoes, out-of-time-order correlators, and operator growth, which is valid at any dissipation strength. We assert that the Loschmidt echo has two dynamical regimes depending on the time $t$ and the strength of the noise $p$: Gaussian decay for $pt\ll1$ and exponential decay (with a noise-independent decay rate) for $pt\gg1$. Lastly, we rigorously prove all our results for a solvable chaotic many-body quantum circuit, the dissipative random phase model -- thus providing exact insight into dissipative quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Reduced fidelities for free fermions out of equilibrium: From dynamical quantum phase transitions to Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics after a quantum quench of the reduced fidelities between the states of a subregion $A$ at different times. Precisely, we consider the fidelity between the time-dependent state of $A$ and its initial value, as well as with the state at infinite time. We denote these fidelities as the reduced Loschmidt echo (RLE) and the final-state fidelity (FSF), respectively. If region $A$ is the full systems, the RLE coincide with the standard Loschmidt echo. We focus on quenches from Gaussian states in several instances of the XY spin chain. In the hydrodynamic limit of long times and large sizes of $A$, with their ratio fixed, the reduced fidelities admit a quasiparticle picture interpretation. Interestingly, for some quenches in the hydrodynamic regime the RLE features a complicated structure with an infinite sequence of nested lightcones, corresponding to quasiparticles with arbitrary large group velocities. This leads to a ''staircase'' of cusp-like singularities in the time-derivative of the fidelity. At the sub-hydrodynamic regime for some quenches the RLE exhibits cusp-like singularities, similar to the so-called dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPT). We conjecture a criterion for the occurrence of the DQPT and for the ''critical'' times at which the singularities occur. Finally, we discuss the hydrodynamic limit of the FSF. In particular, we show that it provides a valuable tool to detect the so-called quantum Mpemba effect.</description>

      <title>Reflection positivity and a refined index for 2d invertible phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the validity of reflection positivity in the classification of invertible phases of quantum spin systems. We provide a mathematical model in which every 2d invertible state admits a reflection-positive representative. We prove that reflection positivity provides a canonical lift from the set of invertible phases to the set of invertible phases protected by a $\mathbb{Z}/N$-rotational symmetry. Using this, we define a refined version of the index recently introduced by the author. This refined version conjecturally provides a microscopic characterization of an invariant that coincides with the chiral central charge $c_-$ when conformal field theory effectively describes the boundary modes.</description>

      <title>Landscape of scattering universality with general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality in physics describes how disparate systems can exhibit identical low-energy behavior. Here, we reveal a rich landscape of new universal scattering phenomena governed by the interplay between an interaction and a system's density of states. We investigate one-dimensional scattering with general dispersion relations of the form $\epsilon(k) = |k|^m$ and $\epsilon(k) = \text{sign}(k)|k|^m$ for any real $m \geq 1$. For key models such as emitter scattering and separable potentials, we prove that the low-energy S-matrix converges to universal forms determined solely by the dispersion exponent $m$ and a few integers defining the interaction. This establishes a broad classification of new universality classes, extending far beyond the standard quadratic dispersion paradigm. Furthermore, we derive a generalized Levinson's theorem relating the total winding of the scattering phase to the number of bound states. Our findings are directly relevant to synthetic quantum systems, where engineered dispersion relations in atomic arrays and photonic crystals offer a platform to explore these universal behaviors.</description>

      <title>Can We Conjugate the Orbital Angular Momentum of a Single Photon with Nonlinear Optics? A Theoretical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated parametric down-conversion (StimPDC) produces an idler beam that exhibits a phase conjugate of the spatial structure of the classical seed beam. Extending this effect to the single-photon regime can, in principle, enable the control of the orbital angular momentum of single photons. However, its experimental implementation remains challenging due to the lower photon flux of realistic single-photon sources compared to a classical pump beam, which causes the StimPDC process to occur less frequently compared to its spontaneous counterpart. To overcome this, we propose a cascaded parametric down-conversion scheme, in which the signal photon from a spontaneously down-converted pair seeds the StimPDC process, while the idler photon heralds the seed's presence. This configuration uses coincidence detection to effectively post-select for stimulated events among the background of spontaneous contributions. We show that phase conjugation at the single-photon level manifests as a bias towards equal orbital angular momentum between the heralding idler and the stimulated idler. Our results offer a practical route to manipulate single-photon correlations in the orbital angular momentum degree of freedom and could have implications for applications such as free-space quantum communication and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg-atom electrometry, as an emerging cutting-edge technology, features high sensitivity, broad bandwidth, calibration-free operation, and beyond. However, until now the key atomic vapor cells used for confining electric field-sensitive Rydberg atoms nearly made with traditional glass-blown techniques, hindering the miniaturization, integration, and batch manufacturing. Here, we present the wafer-level MEMS atomic vapor cells with glass-silicon-glass sandwiched structure that are batch-manufactured for both frequency stability and electric field measurement. We use specially customized ultra-thick silicon wafers with a resistivity exceeding 10,000 cm, three orders of magnitude higher than that of typical silicon, and a thickness of 6 mm, providing a 4-fold improvement in optical interrogation length. With the as-developed MEMS atomic vapor cell, we configured a high-sensitivity Rydberg-atom electrometry with the minimal detectable microwave field to be 2.8 mV/cm. This combination of miniaturization and sensitivity represents a significant advance in the state-of-the-art field of Rydberg-atom electrometry, paving the way for chip-scale Rydberg-atom electrometry and potentially opening up new applications in a wider variety of fields.</description>

      <title>A Continuous Energy Ising Machine Leveraging Difference-of-Convex Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be reformulated as the task of finding the ground state of a physical system, such as the Ising model. Most existing Ising solvers are inspired by simulated annealing. Although annealing techniques offer scalability, they lack convergence guarantees and are sensitive to the cooling schedule. We propose to solve the Ising problem by relaxing the binary spins to continuous variables and introducing a potential function (attractor) that steers the solution toward binary spin configurations. The resulting Hamiltonian can be expressed as a difference of convex functions, enabling the design of efficient iterative algorithms that require a single matrix-vector multiplication per iteration and are backed by convergence guarantees. We implement our Ising solver across a range of GPU platforms: from edge devices to high-performance computing clusters and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms existing solvers across problem sizes ranging from small ($10^3$ spins) to ultra-large ($10^8$ spins).</description>

Abstract: The Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization of isolated quantum systems. While the standard ETH is formulated in the absence of degeneracy, physical systems often possess symmetries that induce degenerate energy eigenstates. In this paper, we investigate ETH in the presence of nontrivial projective representations of Abelian symmetries, which arise naturally from 't Hooft anomalies. We argue that such projective structures can lead to degenerate excited states, and how the ETH can be formulated under such degeneracies. In the presence of projective charges supplied by symmetry operators, our projective-representation ETH indicates that the stationary values of the operators are described by the generalized Gibbs ensemble instead of the standard Gibbs ensemble. Our findings elucidate the role of symmetry and degeneracy in quantum thermalization and pave the way for further exploration of the ETH in anomalous symmetry settings.</description>

Abstract: In idealized treatments of the Unruh effect, a two-level atom is accelerated in a prescribed classical trajectory through the vacuum of a quantum field -- the Unruh bath -- which causes the atom's internal state to thermalize to a temperature proportional to the acceleration. This happens via emission and absorption of quanta by the atom, leading to a detailed balance between fluctuations in the Unruh bath and associated dissipation of the atom's internal energy. In any physical manifestation of the Unruh effect, the center-of-mass (CoM) degree of freedom of the atom is dynamical, and is therefore coupled to the Unruh bath via momentum recoil during the absorption/emission process. We study this scenario and show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem fails for the CoM degree of freedom, while still being upheld for the internal energy. That is, the CoM of an accelerated atom is not in thermal equilibrium with the Unruh bath, while its internal level can be.</description>

      <title>Boundary Renormalization Group Flow of Entanglement Entropy at a (2+1)-Dimensional Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the second order R\'enyi entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a columnar dimerized square lattice. The universal constant $\gamma$ in the area-law scaling $S_{2}(\ell) = \alpha\ell - \gamma$ is found to be sensitive to the entangling surface configurations, with $\gamma_{\text{sp}} &gt; 0$ for strong-bond-cut (special) surfaces and $\gamma_{\text{ord}} &lt; 0$ for weak-bond-cut (ordinary) surfaces, which is attributed to the distinct conformal boundary conditions. Introducing boundary dimerization drives a renormalization group (RG) flow from the special to the ordinary boundary criticality, and the constant $\gamma$ decreases monotonically with increasing dimerization strength, demonstrating irreversible evolution under the boundary RG flow. These results provide strong numerical evidence for a higher-dimensional analog of the $g$-theorem, and suggest $\gamma$ as a characteristic function for boundary RG flow in (2+1)-dimensional conformal field theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulations of Green's functions for small superfluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An end-to-end strategy for hybrid quantum-classical computations of Green's functions in many-body systems is presented and applied to the pairing model. The scheme makes explicit use of the spectral representation of the Green's function, which entails the calculation of the $N$-body ground state as well as eigenstates and associated energies of the $(N\pm1)$-body neighbors. While the former is accessed via variational techniques, the latter are constructed by means of the quantum subspace expansion method. Different ansatzes for the ground-state wave function, originating from either classical or quantum approaches, are tested and compared to exact calculations. The resulting one-body Green's functions prove to be accurate approximations of the exact one for a large range of parameters, including across the normal-to-superfluid transition. As a byproduct, this approach yields a good description of odd systems provided that the starting even system is well reproduced by the variational ansatz.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic lightcones in the multiparticle Anderson model with sparse interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the dynamics of the one-dimensional $ XY $ model with random magnetic field perturbed by a sparse set of $ ZZ $ terms with a large coupling constant $ \Delta $ gives rise to Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bounds with a logarithmic lightcone and amplitude proportional to $ \Delta^{-1} $. These spin systems are equivalent to a set of spinless lattice fermions subjected to a random on site potential and sparse density-density interactions. In the absence of the random magnetic field we also obtain a suppression of the L-R bounds as $ \Delta^{-1} $. These results follow from the application of a general theorem about the L-R bound of a generic local time-dependent one-dimensional spin system with local time-dependent perturbations. Adopting the interaction picture of the dynamics, the large and sparse $ ZZ $ perturbations of the $ XY $ model, with or without disorder, are mapped into high-frequency periodic perturbations. All our results are non-perturbative.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical systems: statistics, entropy, microcanonical ensemble and its connection to the canonical ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe in detail a mathematical framework in which statistical ensembles of hybrid classical- quantum systems can be properly described. We show how a maximum entropy principle can be applied to derive the microcanonical ensemble of hybrid systems. We investigate its properties, and in particular how the microcanonical ensemble and its marginal classical and quantum ensembles can be defined for arbitrarily small range of energies for the whole system. We show how, in this situations, the ensembles are well defined for a continuum of energy values, unlike the purely quantum microcanonical ensemble, thus proving that hybrid systems translate properties of classical systems to the quantum realm. We also analyze the relation with the hybrid canonical ensemble by considering the microcanonical ensemble of a compound system composed of a hybrid subsystem weakly coupled to a reservoir and computing the marginal ensemble of the hybrid subsystem. Lastly, we apply the theory to the statistics of a toy model, which gives some insight on the different properties presented along the article.</description>

      <title>On the connection between Bochner's theorem on positive definite maps and Choi theorem on complete positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we establish a connection between Bochner's theorem on positive definite maps and Choi theorem on complete positivity. We begin by defining a convolution product between maps from the contracted semigroup algebra $\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ of a semigroup $S$ to an arbitrary associative algebra $\mathcal{A}$. The convolution product makes the space $L(\mathbb{C}_0[S],\mathcal{A})$ of linear maps from $\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ to $\mathcal{A}$ an associative algebra. We prove that the convolution algebra $L(\mathbb{C}_0[S],\mathcal{A})$ and the tensor product algebra $\mathbb{C}_0[S] \otimes \mathcal{A}$ are isomorphic. As a consequence, in the specific case of the inverse semigroup of matrix units, we identify the product in the space of maps on the matrix algebras which is preserved by the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism as convolution. Then, by defining the Fourier transform of a map from $\mathbb{C}_0[S]$ to $M_n(\mathbb{C})$, we derive the Fourier inversion formula when $S$ is a finite inverse semigroup. As a corollary of this formula, we show that in the case of the inverse semigroup of matrix units, the Fourier transformation of a map with respect to the identity representation becomes the Choi matrix of the map and the Fourier inversion formula becomes the Choi inversion formula. Then, by defining the notion of matrix valued positive definite maps, we prove Bochner's theorem in the context of finite inverse semigroup. It is demonstrated that Bochner's theorem reduces to Choi theorem on completely positive maps when the inverse semigroup of matrix units is considered. Additionally, the necessary and sufficient condition on a representation $\rho:M_m \to M_{d_{\rho}}(\mathbb{C})$ such that the Complete positivity vs. positivity correspondence holds between a linear map $\Phi: M_m(\mathbb{C}) \to M_n(\mathbb{C})$ and its Fourier Transform $\widehat{\Phi}(\rho)$ is obtained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos and Universal Trotterisation Behaviours in Digital Quantum Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.11113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing has emerged as a promising paradigm within the field of quantum machine learning, harnessing the inherent properties of quantum systems to optimise and enhance information processing capabilities.
  Here, we explore the potential of quantum-inspired machine learning methodologies by leveraging the complex dynamics of quantum reservoirs to address computationally challenging tasks with enhanced efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we employ an open quantum system model comprising two-level atomic ensembles coupled to Lorentzian photonic cavities to construct a quantum physical reservoir computer layer for a recurrent neural network. We evaluate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to a standard machine learning image-recognition problem and benchmarking its performance against a conventional neural network of similar architecture, but lacking the quantum physical reservoir computer layer. Remarkably, as the dataset size increases, the quantum physical reservoir computer outperforms the conventional neural network, requiring fewer training epochs and a smaller dataset to achieve comparable accuracy. Furthermore, we employ the quantum physical reservoir computing approach to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, focusing on atomic system ensembles interacting with a structured photonic reservoir associated with a photonic band-gap material. Our results reveal that the quantum reservoir computer provides equally powerful representations for quantum dynamical problems, maintaining effectiveness even under constraints of limited training data.</description>

      <title>Quantum state testing beyond the polarizing regime and quantum triangular discrimination</title>

Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$) captures computational difficulties of the time-bounded quantum state testing problem with respect to the trace distance, deciding whether $\mathrm{T}(\rho_0,\rho_1)$ is at least $\alpha$ or at most $\beta$, known as the Quantum State Distinguishability Problem ($\mathrm{QSDP}$) introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002). However, $\mathrm{QSDP}[\alpha,\beta]$ is in $\mathsf{QSZK}$ only within the constant polarizing regime, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants satisfying $\alpha^2 &gt; \beta$ (rather than $\alpha &gt; \beta$), similar to its classical counterpart shown by Sahai and Vadhan (JACM 2003) due to the polarization lemma (error reduction for $\mathrm{SDP}$).
  Recently, Berman, Degwekar, Rothblum, and Vasudevan (TCC 2019) extended the $\mathsf{SZK}$ containment of $\mathrm{SDP}$ beyond the polarizing regime via the time-bounded distribution testing problems with respect to the triangular discrimination and the Jensen-Shannon divergence. Our work introduces proper quantum analogs for these problems by defining quantum counterparts for triangular discrimination. We investigate whether the quantum analogs behave similarly to their classical counterparts and examine the limitations of existing approaches to polarization regarding quantum distances. These new $\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete problems improve $\mathsf{QSZK}$ containments of $\mathrm{QSDP}$ beyond the polarizing regime and establish a simple $\mathsf{QSZK}$-hardness for the quantum entropy difference problem ($\mathrm{QEDP}$) defined by Ben-Aroya, Schwartz, and Ta-Shma (ToC 2010). Furthermore, we prove that $\mathrm{QSDP}$ with some exponentially small errors is in $\mathsf{PP}$, while the same problem without error is in $\mathsf{NQP}$.</description>

      <title>Does Quantum Mechanics Breed Larger, More Intricate Quantum Theories? The Case for Experience-Centric Quantum Theory and the Interactome of Quantum Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We pose and address the radical question that whether quantum mechanics, known for its firm internal structure and enormous empirical success, carries in itself the genome of larger quantum theories which have higher internal intricacies and phenomenological versatilities. That is, on the basic level of closed quantum systems and regardless of interpretational aspects, whether standard quantum theory (SQT) harbors quantum theories with context-based deformed principles or structures, having definite predictive power within broader scopes. We answer the question in affirmative following complementary evidence and reasoning arising from quantum-computation-based quantum simulation and fundamental, general, abstract rationales in the frameworks of information theory, fundamental or functional emergence, and participatory agency. In this light, as we show, one is led to the recently proposed experience-centric quantum theory (ECQT), which is a larger and richer theory of quantum behaviors with drastically generalized quantum dynamics. ECQT allows the quantum information of the closed quantum system's developed state history to continually contribute to defining manybody interactions, Hamiltonians, and even internal elements and ``particles'' of the total system. Hence the unitary evolutions are continually impacted and become guidable by the agent-system's experience. The intrinsic interplay of unitarity and non-Markovianity in ECQT brings about a host of diverse behavioral phases, which concurrently infuse closed and open quantum system characteristics and even surpasses the theory of open systems in SQT. In the broader perspective, an upshot of our investigation is the existence of the quantum interactome--the interactive landscape of all coexisting, independent context-based quantum theories which emerge from inferential participatory agencies--and its predictive phenomenological utility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to build an astronomical interferometer using continuous variable quantum teleportation to overcome the transmission loss between distant telescopes. The scheme relies on two-mode squeezed states shared by distant telescopes as entanglement resources, which are distributed using continuous variable quantum repeaters. We find the optimal measurement on the teleported states, which uses beam-splitters and photon-number-resolved detection. Compared to prior proposals relying on discrete states, our scheme has the advantages of using linear optics to implement the scheme without wasting stellar photons, and making use of multiphoton events, which are regarded as noise in previous discrete schemes. We also outline the parameter regimes in which our scheme outperforms the direct detection method, schemes utilizing distributed discrete-variable entangled states, and local heterodyne techniques.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Routing over Networks with Time Multiplexed Repeaters</title>

Abstract: Quantum networks will be able to service consumers with long-distance entanglement by use of quantum repeaters that generate Bell pairs (or links) with their neighbors, iid with probability $p$ and perform Bell State Measurements (BSMs) on the links that succeed iid with probability $q$. While global link state knowledge is required to maximize the rate of entanglement generation between any two consumers, it increases the protocol latency due to the classical communication requirements and requires long quantum memory coherence times. We propose two entanglement routing protocols that require only local link state knowledge to relax the quantum memory coherence time requirements and reduce the protocol latency. These protocols utilize multi-path routing protocol and time multiplexed repeaters. The time multiplexed repeaters first generate links for $k$-time steps before performing BSMs on any pairs of links. Our two protocols differ in the decision rule used for performing BSMs at the repeater: the first being a static path based routing protocol and second a dynamic distance based routing protocol. The performance of these protocols depends on the quantum network topology and the consumers' location. We observe that the average entanglement rate and the latency increase with the time multiplexing block length, $k$, irrespective of the protocol. When a step function memory decoherence model is introduced such that qubits are held in the quantum memory for an exponentially distributed time with mean $\mu$, an optimal $k$ ($k_\text{opt}$) value appears, such that for increasing $k$ beyond $k_{\rm opt}$ hurts the entanglement rate. $k_{\rm opt}$ decreases with $p$ and increases with $\mu$. $k_{\rm opt}$ appears due to the tradeoff between benefits from time multiplexing and the increased likelihood of previously established Bell pairs decohering due to finite memory coherence times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an explicit construction for a key distribution protocol in the Quantum Computational Timelock (QCT) security model, where one assumes that computationally secure encryption may only be broken after a time much longer than the coherence time of available quantum memories.
  Taking advantage of the QCT assumptions, we build a key distribution protocol called HM-QCT from the Hidden Matching problem for which there exists an exponential gap in one-way communication complexity between classical and quantum strategies.
  We establish that the security of HM-QCT against arbitrary i.i.d. attacks can be reduced to the difficulty of solving the underlying Hidden Matching problem with classical information. Legitimate users, on the other hand, can use quantum communication, which gives them the possibility of sending multiple copies of the same quantum state while retaining an information advantage. This leads to an everlasting secure key distribution scheme over $n$ bosonic modes. Such a level of security is unattainable with purely classical techniques. Remarkably, the scheme remains secure with up to $\mathcal{O}\big( \frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log(n)}\big)$ input photons for each channel use, extending the functionalities and potentially outperforming QKD rates by several orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk Attacks and Defence in a Shared Quantum Computing Environment</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to provide solutions to problems that are intractable on classical computers, but the accuracy of the current generation of quantum computers suffer from the impact of noise or errors such as leakage, crosstalk, dephasing, and amplitude damping among others. As the access to quantum computers is almost exclusively in a shared environment through cloud-based services, it is possible that an adversary can exploit crosstalk noise to disrupt quantum computations on nearby qubits, even carefully designing quantum circuits to purposely lead to wrong answers. In this paper, we analyze the extent and characteristics of crosstalk noise through tomography conducted on IBM Quantum computers, leading to an enhanced crosstalk simulation model. Our results indicate that crosstalk noise is a significant source of errors on IBM quantum hardware, making crosstalk based attack a viable threat to quantum computing in a shared environment. Based on our crosstalk simulator benchmarked against IBM hardware, we assess the impact of crosstalk attacks and develop strategies for mitigating crosstalk effects. Through a systematic set of simulations, we assess the effectiveness of three crosstalk attack mitigation strategies, namely circuit separation, qubit allocation optimization via reinforcement learning, and the use of spectator qubits, and show that they all overcome crosstalk attacks with varying degrees of success and help to secure quantum computing in a shared platform.</description>

      <title>Observable criterion for collective entanglement in Boson-lattice system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optical lattice with cold trapped atoms represents a quantum system of fundamental importance as it enables the study of quantum many-body system in a controllable way. It is thus necessary to develop theoretical and experimental tools to explore quantum correlation in such systems to advance our understanding of many-body physics. While previous works have identified some profound aspects of quantum entanglement using e.g. entanglement entropy, there exists a critical demand to have an experimentally accessible tool to investigate many-body quantum entanglement in a broad context. We present an entanglement criterion characterizing collective entanglement in Boson lattice systems and enabling experimental observation readily. On applying our approach to the extended Bose-Hubbard model, we show that our criterion witnesses phase transitions such as Mott insulator--superfluid and Mott insulator--charge density wave transitions. Remarkably, it also makes it possible to detect multipartite entanglement among boson lattice sites in a rigorous sense. Our criterion can be experimentally tested via Raman scattering or time-of-flight methods, which are within the reach of current technology.</description>

      <title>Constrained and Vanishing Expressivity of Quantum Fourier Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we highlight an unforeseen behavior of the expressivity of Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) for machine learning. A large class of these models, seen as Fourier Series which frequencies are derived from the encoding gates, were thought to have their Fourier coefficients mostly determined by the trainable gates. Here, we demonstrate a new correlation between the Fourier coefficients of the quantum model and its encoding gates. In addition, we display a phenomenon of vanishing expressivity in certain settings, where some Fourier coefficients vanish exponentially when the number of qubits grows. These two behaviors imply novel forms of constraints which limit the expressivity of PQCs, and therefore imply a new inductive bias for Quantum models. The key concept in this work is the notion of a frequency redundancy in the Fourier series spectrum, which determines its importance. Those theoretical behaviours are observed in numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14570v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the capacity of quantum circuits through the lens of approximation theory is essential for evaluating the complexity of quantum circuits required to solve various problems in scientific computation. We design quantum circuits capable of approximating d-dimensional functions within the Korobov function space. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum signal processing (QSP) and the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) algorithms to build quantum circuits that output Chebyshev polynomials. We also present a quantitative analysis of the approximation error rates and evaluates the computational complexity of implementing the proposed circuits. Since the Korobov function space is a subspace of the certain Sobolev spaces, our work develops a theoretical foundation for implementing a large class of functions suitable for applications on a quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a promising pathway toward achieving practical quantum advantage on near-term hardware. Despite this promise, for generic, expressive ansatze, their scalability is critically hindered by barren plateaus--regimes of exponentially vanishing gradients. We demonstrate that initializing a hardware-efficient, Floquet-structured Ansatz within the many-body localized (MBL) phase mitigates barren plateaus and enhances algorithmic trainability. Through analysis of the inverse participation ratio, entanglement entropy, and a novel low-weight stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, we characterize a distinct MBL-thermalization transition. Below a critical kick strength, the circuit avoids forming a unitary 2-design, exhibits robust area-law entanglement, and maintains non-vanishing gradients. Leveraging this MBL regime facilitates the efficient variational preparation of ground states for several model Hamiltonians with significantly reduced computational resources. Crucially, experiments on IBM's 127-qubit Brisbane processor provide evidence for the preservation of trainable gradients in the MBL phase for a kicked Heisenberg chain, validating our approach on contemporary noisy hardware. Our findings position MBL-based initialization as a viable strategy for developing scalable VQAs and motivate the broader integration of localization phenomena into quantum algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Collectively enhanced ground-state cooling in subwavelength atomic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength atomic arrays feature strong light-induced dipole-dipole interactions, resulting in subradiant collective resonances characterized by narrowed linewidths. In this work, we present a sideband cooling scheme for atoms trapped in subwavelength arrays that utilizes these narrow collective resonances. Working in the Lamb-Dicke regime, we derive an effective master equation for the atomic motion by adiabatically eliminating the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms, and validate its prediction with numerical simulations of the full system. Our results demonstrate that subradiant resonances enable the cooling of ensembles of atoms to temperatures lower than those achievable without dipole interactions, provided the atoms have different trap frequencies. Remarkably, narrow collective resonances can be sideband-resolved even when the individual atomic transition is not. In such scenarios, ground-state cooling becomes feasible solely due to light-induced dipole-dipole interactions. This approach could be utilized for future quantum technologies based on dense ensembles of emitters, and paves the way towards harnessing many-body cooperative decay for enhanced motional control.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of two-dimensional connectivity for a scalable error-corrected ion-trap quantum processor architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major hurdle for building a large-scale quantum computer is increasing the number of qubits while maintaining connectivity between them. In trapped-ion devices, this connectivity can be achieved by moving subregisters consisting of a few ions across the processor. Here, we focus on an architecture, which we refer to as the Quantum Spring Array (QSA), that is based on a rectangular two-dimensional lattice of linear strings of ions. Connectivity between adjacent ion strings can be controlled by adjusting their separation. This requires control of trapping potentials along two directions, one along the axis of the ion string and one radial to it. In this work, we investigate key elements of the QSA architecture along both directions: We show that the coupling rate between neighboring lattice sites increases with the number of ions per site and the motion of the coupled system can be resilient to electrical noise, both being key requisites for fast and high-fidelity quantum gate operations. The coherence of the coupling is assessed and an entangling gate between qubits stored in radially separated trapping regions is demonstrated. Moreover, we demonstrate control over radio-frequency signals to adjust the radial separation, and thus the coupling rate, between strings. We further present constructions for the implementation of parallelized, transversal gate operations, and map the QSA architecture to code primitives for fault-tolerant quantum error correction, providing a step towards a quantum processor architecture that is optimized for large-scale operation.</description>

Abstract: Bosonic codes encode quantum information into a single infinite-dimensional physical system endowed with error correction capabilities. This reduces the need for complex management of many physical constituents compared with standard approaches employing multiple physical qubits. Recent discussions of bosonic codes centre around correcting only boson-loss errors, with phase errors either actively suppressed or deferred to subsequent layers of encoding with standard qubit codes. Rotationally symmetric bosonic (RSB) codes, which include the well-known cat and binomial codes, are capable of simultaneous correction of loss and phase errors, offering an alternate route that deals with arbitrary errors already at the base layer. Here, we investigate the robustness of such codes, moving away from the more idealistic past studies towards a circuit-level noise analysis closer to the practical situation where every physical component in the device is potentially faulty. We extend the concept of fault tolerance to the case of RSB codes, and then examine the performance of two known error correction circuits under circuit-level noise. Our analysis reveals a significantly more stringent noise threshold for fault-tolerant operation than found in past works; nevertheless, we show how, through waiting-time optimization and the use of squeezing, we can restore the noise requirements to a regime achievable with near-term quantum hardware. While our focus here is on cat codes for concreteness, a similar analysis applies for general RSB codes.</description>

      <title>From Problem to Solution: A general Pipeline to Solve Optimisation Problems on Quantum Hardware</title>

Abstract: With constant improvements of quantum hardware and quantum algorithms, quantum advantage comes within reach. Parallel to the development of the computer at the end of the twentieth century, quantum software development will now also rapidly gain in importance and scale. On account of the inherent complexity and novelty of quantum computing (QC), as well as the expected lack of expertise of many of the stakeholders involved in its development, QC software development projects are exposed to the risk of being conducted in a crowded and unstructured way, lacking clear guidance and understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive quantum optimisation development pipeline, novel in its depth of 22 activities across multiple stages, coupled with project management insights, uniquely targeted to the late noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) [1] and early post-NISQ eras. We have extensively screened literature and use-cases, interviewed experts, and brought in our own expertise to develop this general quantum pipeline. The proposed solution pipeline is divided into five stages: Use-case Identification, Solution Draft, Pre-Processing, Execution and Post-Processing. Additionally, the pipeline contains two review points to address the project management view, the inherent risk of the project and the current technical maturity of QC technology. This work is intended as an orientation aid for all stakeholders involved in the development of QC applications and should therefore increase the chances of success of quantum software projects. We encourage researchers to adapt and extend the model where appropriate, as technological development also continues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a coarse-grained map of a quantum many-body system, we construct the inverse map that assigns a microscopic state to a coarse-grained state based on the maximum entropy principle. Assuming unitary evolution in the microscopic system, we examine the resulting dynamics in the coarse-grained system using the assignment map. We investigate both a two-qubit system, with \swap\ and controlled-\textsc{not}\ gates, and $n$-qubit systems, configured either in an Ising spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these dynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as nonlinearity and non-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the initial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic dynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced by our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from conventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in describing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into the effects of coarse graining on quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is promising compared to other quantum algorithms, but also depends significantly on the appropriate design of the underlying quantum circuit. Recent research by Bowles, Ahmend \&amp; Schuld, 2024 [1] raises questions about the effectiveness of entanglement in circuits for quantum machine learning algorithms. In our paper we want to address questions about the effectiveness of state preparation via Hadamard gates and entanglement via CNOT gates in the realm of quantum optimisation. We have constructed a total of eight different circuits, varying in implementation details, solving a total of 100 randomly generated MaxCut problems. Our results show no improvement with Hadamard gates applied at the beginning of the circuits. Furthermore, also entanglement shows no positive effect on the solution quality in our small scale experiments. In contrast, the investigated circuits that used entanglement generally showed lower, as well as deteriorating results when the number of circuit layers is increased. Based on our results, we hypothesise that entanglement can play a coordinating role, such that changes in individual parameters are distributed across multiple qubits in quantum circuits, but that this positive effect can quickly be overdosed and turned negative. The verification of this hypothesis represents a challenge for future research and can have a considerable influence on the development of new hybrid algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Field Theory Simulations on NISQ Devices with Hamiltonian Truncation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers can efficiently simulate highly entangled quantum systems, offering a solution to challenges facing classical simulation of Quantum Field Theories (QFTs). This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for simulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation (HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the complexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical properties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach converges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting physics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the truncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational basis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines, reducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As a result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited to Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number of qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running simulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical predictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of open quantum systems through the Hamiltonian of Mean Force, focusing on two models: a two-qubit system interacting with a thermal bath and a Jaynes-Cummings Model without the rotating wave approximation. By analyzing both weak and strong coupling regimes, we uncover the impact of environmental interactions on quantum thermodynamic quantities, including specific heat capacity, internal energy, and entropy. Further, the ergotropy and entropy production are computed. We also explore the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, which sets an upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Resource Management and Circuit Scheduling for Distributed Quantum Computing Interconnect Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12675v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the scalability limitations of monolithic quantum processors in terms of computational capability. However, realising the full potential of DQC requires effective resource management and circuit scheduling. This involves efficiently assigning each circuit to a subset of quantum processing units (QPUs), based on factors such as their computational power and connectivity. In heterogeneous DQC networks with arbitrary connectivity topologies and non-identical QPUs, this becomes a complex challenge. This paper addresses resource management and circuit scheduling in such settings, with a focus on computing resource allocation in a quantum data center. We propose circuit scheduling algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Our MILP model accounts for errors arising from inter-QPU communication. In particular, the proposed schemes consider key factors, including network topology, QPU capacities, and quantum circuit structure, to make efficient scheduling and allocation decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms significantly improve circuit execution time and scheduling efficiency (measured by makespan and throughput), while also reducing inter-QPU communication overhead, compared to a baseline random allocation strategy. This work provides valuable insights into resource management strategies for scalable and heterogeneous DQC systems.</description>

      <title>Against (unitary) interpretation (of quantum mechanics): removing the metaphysical load</title>

Abstract: In June 1925 Heisenberg arrived at Helgoland/Heligoland island to escape a fit of hay fever. He returned with a sketch of a strange theory of the micro-world, which we now call quantum mechanics. This essay attempts to present a look at this theory, which tries to return to the original insight of Heisenberg on what should be the essence of a theory of atomic realm: it must be a theory of the observable events, in which fundamentally unobservable quantities have no place. No ontological status is given to elements of the mathematical formulation of the theory. The theory is about our description of events in laboratories, probabilities of which are given by the Born rule.
  Following Bohr, these events involve macroscopic measuring apparatuses, and the accessible final events are classically describable. Information about the events is cloneable, as it is of a classical nature.
  The modern quantum theory of classicality is the decoherence theory. It treats "the pointer variable" of measuring apparatus as an open system interacting with an environment consisting of all other "zillions" of degrees of freedom of the device, and anything coupled to it. Because such environment is uncontrollable we have no possibility to reverse measurements. The quantum mechanical measurement theory based on decoherence theory is reproducing the predictions of Born rule.
  Notwithstanding, possibility of reversing measurements and of application of Born rule in situations other than these which lead to macroscopically observable events are features of a modification of quantum mechanics which is called by its adherents "unitary quantum mechanics".
  As its predictions, which go beyond quantum mechanics, are not testable - we claim that unitary quantum mechanics in an interpretation of quantum mechanics. As such it is metaphysics.</description>

Abstract: While commonly used entanglement criteria for continuous variable systems are based on quadrature measurements, here we study entanglement detection from measurements of the Wigner function. These are routinely performed in platforms such as trapped ions and circuit QED, where homodyne measurements are difficult to be implemented. We provide complementary criteria which we show to be tight for a variety of experimentally relevant Gaussian and non-Gaussian states. Our results show novel approaches to detect entanglement in continuous variable systems and shed light on interesting connections between known criteria and the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bayes' rule and Petz transpose map from the minimum change principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00319v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayes' rule, which is routinely used to update beliefs based on new evidence, can be derived from a principle of minimum change. This principle states that updated beliefs must be consistent with new data, while deviating minimally from the prior belief. Here, we introduce a quantum analog of the minimum change principle and use it to derive a quantum Bayes' rule by minimizing the change between two quantum input-output processes, not just their marginals. This is analogous to the classical case, where Bayes' rule is obtained by minimizing several distances between the joint input-output distributions. When the change maximizes the fidelity, the quantum minimum change principle has a unique solution, and the resulting quantum Bayes' rule recovers the Petz transpose map in many cases.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-based quantum phase estimation: Towards estimation of parametrized eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenvalues of matrices, including the phase estimation algorithm, serve as core subroutines in a wide range of quantum algorithms, including those in quantum chemistry and quantum machine learning. The standard quantum eigenvalue (phase) estimation algorithm accepts a Hermitian (unitary) matrix and a state in an unknown superposition of its eigenstates as input, and coherently records the estimates for real eigenvalues (eigenphases) in an ancillary register. Extension of quantum eigenvalue and phase estimation algorithms to the case of non-normal input matrices is obstructed by several factors such as non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, existence of generalized eigenvectors and the fact that eigenvalues may lie anywhere on the complex plane. In this work, we propose a novel approach for estimating the eigenvalues of non-normal matrices based on preparation of a state that we call the "resolvent state". We construct the first efficient algorithm for estimating the phases of the unimodular eigenvalues of a given non-unitary matrix. We then construct an efficient algorithm for estimating the real eigenvalues of a given non-Hermitian matrix, achieving complexities that match the best known results while operating under significantly relaxed assumptions on the non-real part of the spectrum. The resolvent-based approach that we introduce also extends to estimating eigenvalues that lie on a parametrized complex curve, subject to explicitly stated conditions, thereby paving the way for a new paradigm of parametric eigenvalue estimation.</description>

      <title>Systematic construction of stabilizer codes via gauging abelian boundary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a systematic framework to construct a (d+1)-dimensional stabilizer model from an initial generic d-dimensional abelian symmetry. Our approach builds upon the iterative gauging procedure, developed by one of the authors in [J. Garre-Rubio, Nature Commun. 15, 7986 (2024)], in which an initial symmetric state is repeatedly gauged to obtain an emergent model in one dimension higher that supports the initial symmetry at its boundary. This method not only enables the construction of emergent states and corresponding commuting stabilizer Hamiltonians of which they are ground states, but it also provides a way to construct gapped boundary conditions for these models that amount to spontaneously breaking part of the boundary symmetry. In a detailed introductory example, we showcase our paradigm by constructing three-dimensional Clifford-deformed surface codes from iteratively gauging a global 0-form symmetry that lives in two dimensions. We then provide a proof of our main result, hereby drawing upon a slight extension of the gauging procedure of Williamson. We additionally provide two more examples in d=2 in which different type-I fracton orders emerge from gauging initial linear subsystem and Sierpinski fractal symmetries. En passant, we provide explicit tensor network representations of all of the involved gauging maps and the emergent states.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of atoms in number-theory-inspired potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study transitions of atoms between energy levels of several number-theory-inspired atom potentials, under the effect of time-dependent perturbations. First, we simulate in detail the case of a trap whose one-particle spectrum is given by prime numbers. We investigate one-body Rabi oscillations and the excitation lineshape for two resonantly coupled energy levels. We also show that techniques from quantum control are effective in reducing the transition time, compared to the case of a periodic perturbation. Next, we investigate cascades of such transitions. To this end, we pose the following question: can one construct a quantum system where the existence of a continuous resonant cascade is predicted on the validity of a particular statement in number theory? We find that a one-body trap with a log-natural spectrum, parametrically driven with a perturbation of a log-natural frequency, provides such a quantum system. Here, powers of a given natural number will form a ladder of equidistant energy levels; absence of gaps in this ladder is an indication of the validity of the number theory statement in question. Ideas for two more resonance cascade experiments are presented as well: they are designed to illustrate the validity of the Diophantus-Brahmagupta-Fibonacci identity (the set of sums of two squares of integers is closed under multiplication) and the validity of the Goldbach conjecture (every even number is a sum of two primes).</description>

      <title>A new general quantum state verification protocol by the classical shadow method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15870v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Verifying whether a quantum device produces a specific state is a fundamental task in many applications of modern quantum technologies. In the conventional framework of quantum state verification, designing an optimal or efficient protocol for each type of state often requires intricate customization. Recently, Hsin-Yuan Huang et al. introduced a novel approach called the shadow overlap protocol in arXiv:2404.07281v1, which leverages classical shadows to efficiently verify multiple types of states simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a new verification protocol that integrates key ideas from both the conventional framework and the shadow overlap protocol. To achieve this, we first reformulate the shadow overlap protocol using the language of hypothesis testing, which also underpins the conventional framework, and then analyze the similarities and differences between them. Our approach enhances the capabilities of the shadow overlap protocol while addressing some of its limitations, leading to improved sample complexity and a more natural treatment of states with specific structures. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol by applying it to GHZ states and stabilizer states.</description>

Abstract: Metastability is ubiquitous in diverse complex systems. In open quantum systems, metastability offers protection against dissipation and decoherence, yet its application in quantum batteries remains unexplored. We propose a solid-state open quantum battery where metastable states enable stable superextensive charging without complicated protocols and energy storage with extended lifetime. Using a realistic organic maser platform, we show the controllable manner of the work extraction from the quantum battery, which can be exploited for on-demand coherent microwave emission at room temperature. These results not only demonstrate the usefulness of metastability for developing the quantum batteries robust against energy losses, but also provide a paradigm of the practical quantum device powered up by quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to derive a quantum master equation for a system weakly coupled to a chaotic finite-sized bath prepared in a pure state. We show that the emergence of Markovianity is controlled by the spectral function of the ETH and that local detailed balance emerges in the Markovian regime for a broad class of pure bath states. We numerically verify this result by comparing the master equation to dynamics computed using exact diagonalization of a chaotic Hamiltonian. We also compare the master equation to exact dynamics for an integrable bath and find that at finite size they strongly disagree. Our work puts forward eigenstate thermalization as a foundation for open quantum systems theory, thus extending it beyond ensemble bath preparations to chaotic many-body environments in generic pure states.</description>

Abstract: Due to its fundamental principles, quantum theory holds the promise to enhance the security of modern cryptography, from message encryption to anonymous communication, digital signatures, online banking, leader election, one-time passwords and delegated computation. While quantum key distribution (QKD) has already enabled secure key exchange over hundreds of kilometers, a myriad of other quantum-cryptographic primitives are being developed to secure future applications against quantum adversaries. This article surveys the theoretical and experimental developments in quantum cryptography beyond QKD over the past decades, along with advances in secure quantum computation. It provides an intuitive classification of the main quantum primitives and their security levels, summarizes their possibilities and limits, and discusses their implementation with current photonic technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Resolving frequencies in a time-dependent field is classically limited by the measurement bandwidth. Using tools from quantum metrology and quantum control may overcome this limit, yet the full advantage afforded by entanglement so far remains elusive. Here we map the problem of frequency measurement to that of estimating a global dephasing quantum channel. In this way, we determine the ultimate quantum limits of {frequency estimation in stochastic AC} sensing. We find exact {quantum Fisher information bounds} for estimating frequency and frequency differences of stochastic fields. In particular, given two close signals with frequency separation $\omega_r$, we find that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for the separation estimation is approximately $2/\omega_r^2$, {i.e.}~\emph{inversely} proportional to the separation parameter. The bounds are achievable in certain regimes by superpositions of Dicke states. GHZ states are suboptimal but improve precision over unentangled states, achieving Heisenberg scaling in the low-bandwidth limit. This work establishes a robust framework for stochastic AC signal sensing that can be extended to arbitrary time-dependent and stochastic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we adopt the Gradient Projection Method (GPM) to problems of quantum control. For general $N$-level closed and open quantum systems, we derive the corresponding adjoint systems and gradients of the objective functionals, and provide the projection versions of the Pontryagin maximum principle and the GPM, all directly in terms of quantum objects such as evolution operator, Hamiltonians, density matrices, etc. Various forms of the GPM, including one- and two-step, are provided and compared. We formulate the GPM both for closed and open quantum systems, latter for the general case with simultaneous coherent and incoherent controls. The GPM is designed to perform local gradient based optimization in the case when bounds are imposed on the controls. The main advantage of the method is that it allows to exactly satisfy the bounds, in difference to other approaches such as adding constraints as weight to objective. We apply the GPM to several examples including generation of one- and two-qubit gates and two-qubit Bell and Werner states for models of superconducting qubits under the constraint when controls are zero at the initial and final times, and steering an open quantum system state to a target density matrix for simulating action of the Werner-Holevo channel, etc.</description>

      <title>The Mpemba effect in quantum oscillating and two-level systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Empemba effect (ME) is investigated in the context of ubiquitous quantum oscillating and two-level systems (TLS) using a novel approach (DOI 10.1088/1402-4896/ad97f1). Exact reduced density matrices for various initial states are derived. The temporal behavior of the trace distance for these initial states is calculated analytically and presented. For a dissipative quantum oscillating system, it is demonstrated that number states $|N\rangle$ intersect with coherent states $|\alpha\rangle$, with this intersection occurring earlier for smaller values of $N$. Additionally, thermal states intersect with coherent states for specific values of $|\alpha|$, leading to the occurrence of the ME in these two scenarios. A weaker version of the ME is also observed for thermal and number states. In the case of a quantum TLS, it is shown that the ME effect occurs, and the potential for its realization and experimental observation is discussed, with reference to the Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) involving a decaying time-dependent coupling function.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Thermalization Hypothesis in Quantum Spin Chains with Conserved Charges</title>

Abstract: We consider the thermalization hypothesis of pure states in quantum Ising chain with $Z_2$ symmetry, XXZ chain with $U(1)$ symmetry, and XXX chain with $SU(2)$ symmetries. Two kinds of pure states are considered: the energy eigenstates and the typical states evolved unitarily from the random product states for a long enough period. We further group the typical states by their expectation values of the conserved charges and consider the fine-grained thermalization hypothesis. We compare the locally (subsystem) reduced states of typical states/eigenstates with the ones of the corresponding thermal ensemble states. Besides the usual thermal ensembles such as the (micro-)canonical ensemble without conserved charges and the generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE) with all conserved charges included, we also consider the so-called partial-GGEs (p-GGEs), which include only part of the conserved charges in the thermal ensemble. Moreover, in the framework of p-GGE, the Hamiltonian and other conserved charges are on an equal footing. The introduction of p-GGEs extends quantum thermalization to a more general scope. The validity of the subsystem thermalization hypothesis can be quantified by the smallness of the relative entropy of the reduced states obtained from the GGE/p-GGE and the typical states/eigenstates. We examine the validity of the thermalization hypothesis by numerically studying the relative entropy demographics. We show that the thermalization hypothesis holds generically for the small enough subsystems for various p-GGEs. Thus, our framework extends the universality of quantum thermalization.</description>

      <title>Temporally localized quantum operations on continuous-wave thermal light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work showed that thermal light with a blackbody spectrum cannot be decomposed into a mixture of independent localized pulses. However, we find that in the weak-source limit and under the assumption of a flat spectrum, the first non-vacuum term in the state expansion does form a mixture of such pulses. This decomposition is essential for quantum-enhanced astronomical interferometry, which typically operates on localized pulses even though stellar light is inherently continuous-wave. We present a quantum derivation of the van Cittert-Zernike theorem that incorporates finite bandwidth, thereby justifying the operations on localized pulses while processing continuous-wave thermal light. For general spectra in the weak-source limit, we establish a criterion under which correlations between pulses can be safely neglected. When this criterion is not met, we provide a corrected strategy that accurately accounts for both the spectral profile and the detector-defined pulse shape.</description>

      <title>The Extended Uncertainty Principle from a Projector-Valued Measurement Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) from an operational viewpoint, replacing wavefunction-based widths with apparatus-defined position constraints such as a finite slit of width $\Delta x$ or a geodesic ball of radius $R$. Using Hermitian momentum operators consistent with the EUP algebra, we prove a sharp lower bound on the product of momentum spread and preparation size in one dimension and show that it reduces smoothly to the standard quantum limit as the deformation vanishes. We then extend the construction to the dimensions two and three on spaces of constant curvature and obtain the corresponding bound for spherical confinement, clarifying its geometric meaning via an isometry to $S^2$ and $S^3$. The framework links curvature-scale effects to operational momentum floors and suggests concrete tests in diffraction, cold-atom, and optomechanical settings.</description>

      <title>Creation of Wave Packets for Quantum Chromodynamics on Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most ambitious goals of quantum simulation of quantum field theory is the description of scattering in real time, which would allow not only for computation of scattering amplitudes, but also for studying the collision process step by step. The initial state of such simulation is made of typically two wave packets of stable particles moving on top of the vacuum, whose preparation is difficult. Here we extend a previous work to create wave packets of a general kind of particle from the vacuum in lattice gauge theories in various dimensions, including three-dimensional QCD for the first time. The conceptual foundation of this approach is the Haag-Ruelle scattering theory, and the only theoretical limitation is given by the presence of massless particles. In the context of digital quantum computation, the wave packet creation from the vacuum is implemented with the technique known as LCU (linear combination of unitaries). The preparation is performed successfully upon measuring an ancillary register with a certain probability, which vanishes polynomially in the lattice spacing, the wave-packet energy and the momentum narrowness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a feature of quantum scarring in systems with many particles: Quantum scars, living densely near an unstable periodic orbit, must be compensated by corresponding anti-scarred states suppressed there to establish the uniformity of the whole. The uniformity of the underlying phase space is linked to early-time dynamics -- a regime beyond the predictions of random matrix theory and encapsulated in the eigenstate stacking theorem. By extending the domain of the stacking theorem, we apply our theory to a chaotic spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, whose quantum scar dynamics have recently been observed in the laboratory. Our work uncovers how scarring of some eigenstates affects the rest of the chaotic and thermal spectrum in quantum systems with many particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in the physical realization of quantum computing hardware in recent times, bringing us closer than ever before to realizing the promise of quantum computing. However, noise continues to pose a crucial challenge when it comes to scaling up present day quantum processors. While decoherence limits the qubits ability to store information for long periods in the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, the erroneous implementation of control methods for state preparation and measurements leads to faulty implementations of quantum circuits. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the underlying noise can vary in nature over time, making noise profile extraction futile as this new information cannot be harnessed to improve quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling protocols. In this work, we address this challenge using a machine learning-based methodology to quickly extract noise spectra of multiple qubits and demonstrate a possible noise mitigation strategy. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the investigated qubits and then predict the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolution neural network pre-trained on a synthetic dataset. While our protocol is virtually hardware-agnostic, we validate its effectiveness using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. We further use these rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time-dependent noise spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01431v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) using continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC). Focusing on ($1+1$)-dimensional $\varphi^4$ scalar field theory, the approach employs the Hamiltonian formalism to map the theory onto a spatial lattice, with fields represented as quantum harmonic oscillators. Using measurement-based quantum computing, we implement non-Gaussian operations for CQVC platforms. The study introduces methods for preparing initial states with specific momenta and simulating their evolution under the $\varphi^4$ Hamiltonian. Key quantum objects, such as two-point correlation functions, validate the framework against analytical solutions. Scattering simulations further illustrate how mass and coupling strength influence field dynamics and energy redistribution. Thus, we demonstrate CVQC's scalability for larger lattice systems and its potential for simulating more complex field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a one-dimensional single layer placed in the middle of an optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation field. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multiple layers of two-dimensional materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a bright layer description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics in three dimensions. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayered material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Entanglement by Dynamically Encircling a Nexus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal entanglement, characterized by inherently robust operation, is a cornerstone for quantum information processing and communications. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve nonreciprocal entanglement characterized by stability and robustness against environmental fluctuations. Here, we propose a universal nonlinear mechanism to engineer magnetic-free nonreciprocity in dissipative optomechanics by utilizing bistability, a phenomenon ubiquitous across nonlinear physical systems. By dynamically encircling the nexus of bistability, a cusp converged by the bistable surfaces, we obtain nonreciprocal displacement and then utilize it to achieve robust nonreciprocal entanglement. Owing to the unique landscape of bistability, our nonreciprocal displacement and entanglements exhibit stability and robustness through closed-loop operations. Our work presents a foundational framework for leveraging nonlinearity to achieve nonreciprocal quantum information processing. It paves new avenues for exploring nonreciprocal quantum information processing and designing backaction-immune quantum metrology with nonlinearity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing matrix product states (MPSs) on quantum computers is an essential routine in the simulation of many-body physics. However, widely-used schemes based on staircase circuits are often too deep to execute on current hardware. Here we demonstrate that MPSs with short-range correlations can be prepared with shallow circuits by leveraging heuristics from approximate quantum compiling (AQC). We achieve this with ADAPT-AQC, an adaptive-ansatz preparation algorithm, and introduce a generalised initialisation procedure for the existing AQC-Tensor algorithm. We first compare these methods for the task of preparing a molecular electronic structure ground state. We then use them to prepare an antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the 50-site Heisenberg XXZ spin chain near the AFM-XY phase boundary. Through the execution of circuits with up to 59 CZ depth and 1251 CZ gates, we perform a global quench and observe the relaxation of magnetic ordering in a parameter regime previously inaccessible due to deep ground state preparation circuits. Our results demonstrate how the integration of quantum and classical resources can push the boundary of what can be studied on quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional broadband quantum memory significantly expands quantum information processing capabilities, but the memory efficiency becomes insufficient when extended to high dimensions. We demonstrate an efficient quantum memory for hyper-dimensional photons encoded with orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum (SAM). OAM information is encoded from -5 to +5, combined with SAM encoding, enabling up to 22 dimensions. To ensure high memory efficiency, an artificial intelligence algorithm, a modified Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm using Chebyshev sampling, is developed to obtain a perfect signal-control waveform matching. Memory efficiency is experimentally achieved at 92% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 91% for information dimension of 6 and 80% for dimensional number to 22. The fidelity is achieved up to 99% for single-mode Gaussian signal, 95.5% for OAM information, 97.4% for SAM information, and 92% for whole hyper-dimensional signal, which is far beyond no-cloning limitation. Our results demonstrate superior performance and potential applications in high-dimensional quantum information processing. This achievement provides a crucial foundation for future quantum communication and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>QuGStep: Refining Step Size Selection in Gradient Estimation for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a promising approach to solving computationally demanding problems by combining parameterized quantum circuits with classical optimization. Estimating probabilistic outcomes on quantum hardware requires repeated measurements (shots). However, in practice, the limited shot budget introduces significant noise in the evaluation of the objective function. Gradient estimation in VQAs often relies on the finite-difference, which evaluates the noisy objective function at perturbed circuit parameter values. The accuracy of this estimation is highly dependent on the choice of step size for these perturbations. An inappropriate step size can exacerbate the impact of noise, causing inaccurate gradient estimates and hindering the classical optimization in VQAs. This paper proposes QuGStep, an algorithm that addresses the challenge of determining the appropriate step size for finite-difference gradient estimation under a shot budget. QuGStep is grounded in a theorem that proves the optimal step size, which accounts for the shot budget, minimizes the error bound in gradient estimation using finite differences. Numerical experiments approximating the ground state energy of several molecules demonstrate that QuGStep can identify the appropriate step size for the given shot budget to obtain effective gradient estimation. Notably, the step size identified by QuGStep achieved convergence to the ground state energy with over 94% fewer shots compared to using a default step size (i.e., step size of 0.01). These findings highlight the potential of QuGStep to improve the practical deployment and scalability of quantum computing technologies.</description>

Abstract: The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The spectral instabilities plaguing multiphoton qubit-oscillator models are carefully treated by introducing stabilizing higher-order terms in the Hamiltonian. The stabilizing terms preserve low-photon subspaces, avoid negative infinite energies and facilitate reliable numerical calculations used to validate analytical predictions. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their various nonlinear effects.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing has recently been emerging in theoretical chemistry as a realistic avenue meant to offer computational speedup to challenging eigenproblems in the context of strongly-correlated molecular systems or extended materials. Most studies so far have been devoted to the quantum treatment of electronic structure and only a few were directed to the quantum treatment of vibrational structure, which at the moment remains not devoid of unknowns. In particular, we address here a formal problem that arises when simulating a vibrational model under harmonic second quantization, whereby the disruption of the closure relation (resolution of the identity) -- which occurs when truncating the infinite bosonic basis set -- may have some serious effects as regards the correct evaluation of Hamiltonian matrix elements. This relates intimately to the normal ordering of products of ladder operators. In addition, we discuss the relevance of choosing an adequate primitive basis set within the present context with respect to its variational convergence properties. Such fundamental, yet consequential, aspects are illustrated numerically in the present work on a one-dimensional anharmonic Hamiltonian model corresponding to a double-well potential showing strong tunneling, of interest both for vibrational spectroscopy and chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Oscillation Frequency Beyond the Diffraction Limit</title>

Abstract: High-resolution array detectors are widely used in single-particle tracking, but their performance is limited by excess noise from background light and dark current. As pixel resolution increases, the diminished signal per pixel exacerbates susceptibility to noise, degrading tracking accuracy. To overcome this limitation, we use spatial-mode demultiplexing (SPADE) as a noise-robust approach for estimating the motion characteristics of an optical point-like source. We show that SPADE efficiently concentrate the information into a few key spatial modes, drastically reducing the number of detectors while maintaining high estimation precision. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness of the estimation against excess noise by elaborately designing the modes to be decomposed. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a SPADE with two specific modes outperforms direct imaging in estimating the micro-oscillation frequency of an optical point source in the presence of excess noise.</description>

      <title>Theory of quantum-enhanced interferometry with general Markovian light sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optical systems comprising quantum emitters interacting with engineered optical modes generate non-classical states of light that can be used as resource states for quantum-enhanced interferometry. However, outside of well-controlled systems producing either single-mode states (e.g. Fock states or squeezed states) or highly symmetric multi-mode states (e.g. superradiant states), their potential for quantum advantage remains uncharacterized. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze quantum enhanced interferometry with general Markovian quantum light sources. First, we show how to compute the quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the photons emitted by a source efficiently by just tracking its internal dynamics and without explicitly computing the state of the emitted photons. We then use this relationship to elucidate the connection between the level structure and spectrum of the source to a potential quantum advantage in interferometry. Finally, we analyze optimal measurement protocols that can be used to achieve this quantum advantage with experimentally available optical elements. In particular, we show that tunable optical elements with Kerr non-linearity can always be harnessed to implement the optimal measurement for any given source. Simultaneously, we also outline general conditions under which linear optics and photodetection is enough to implement the optimal measurement.</description>

      <title>Towards a Digital Twin of Noisy Quantum Computers: Calibration-Driven Emulation of Transmon Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a parametric error model to construct a digital twin of a superconducting transmon qubit device. The model parameters are extracted from hardware calibration data and supplementary benchmarking circuits, providing a dynamic, system-specific representation of noise and gate imperfections. Given the strong dependence of qubit performance on calibration procedures, our approach captures real-time device fluctuations. By incorporating predominant noise sources derived from underlying physical processes, we enhance the emulation's accuracy while reducing the data required for model fitting. Finally, we validate our model by comparing its predictions with experimental results from a 5-qubit QPU, achieving a mean total variation distance of 0.15 between the shot distributions. This digital twin can be leveraged for predictive performance analysis, error mitigation strategies, and the optimization of quantum protocols, contributing to more reliable quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Agent-Q: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Quantum Circuit Generation and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing pre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system to generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, Agent-Q implements the mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum circuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides 14,000 quantum circuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show superior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and better parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic workflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in quantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Dicke Superradiant Decay with Separable Coherent Spin States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that idealized Dicke superradiant decay from a fully inverted state can at all times be described by a positive statistical mixture of coherent spin states (CSS). Since CSS are separable, this implies that no entanglement is involved in Dicke decay. Based on this result, we introduce a new numerical quantum trajectory approach leading to low-entanglement unravelings. This opens up new possibilities for employing matrix product state (MPS) techniques for large-scale numerical simulations with collective decay processes.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN is a spin-1 defect functioning as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. A precise understanding of its spin decoherence is essential to advance it into a robust qubit platform. First-principles quantum many-body simulations are employed to investigate VB- decoherence in dense nuclear spin baths of h-BN under magnetic fields from 0.01 to 3 T, considering isotopic variants h-10B14N, h-11B14N, h-10B15N, and h-11B15N. A transition boundary (TB) is observed where the dominant decoherence mechanism changes: below the TB, sub-microsecond decoherence is governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics, whereas above it, pairwise flip-flops dominate, extending T2 to tens of microseconds. Analytical predictions place the TB at 0.502 T for h-10B14N and 0.205 T for h-11B14N. The larger TB in h-10BN results from the larger nuclear spin of 10B (I = 3), which produces stronger nuclear modulation over a wider field range. The analytical approach also explains the magnetic-field-insensitive fast modulation observed below the TB. These findings clarify the role of dense nuclear spin baths with large nuclear spins (I &gt;= 1) in VB- decoherence and provide design principles for isotopically engineered h-BN spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multi-Wavelength Photonic Architectures for Future Scalable Trapped Ion Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Particle-in-Cell Method for Plasma Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, where the electrostatic field Poisson solver is implemented on a quantum computer simulator using a hybrid classical-quantum Neural Network (HNN) using data-driven and physics-informed learning approaches. The HNN is trained on classical PIC simulation results and executed via a PennyLane quantum simulator. The remaining computational steps, including particle motion and field interpolation, are performed on a classical system. To evaluate the accuracy and computational cost of this hybrid approach, we test the hybrid quantum-classical electrostatic PIC against the two-stream instability, a standard benchmark in plasma physics. Our results show that the quantum Poisson solver achieves comparable accuracy to classical methods. It also provides insights into the feasibility of using quantum computing and HNNs for plasma simulations. We also discuss the computational overhead associated with current quantum computer simulators, showing the challenges and potential advantages of hybrid quantum-classical numerical methods.</description>

Abstract: We explore the usefulness of mid-circuit measurements to enhance quantum algorithmics. Specifically, we assess how quantum phase estimation (QPE) and mid-circuit measurements can improve the performance of variational quantum algorithms. Our focus is on the single-qubit version of QPE namely, the Hadamard test applied to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) ansatz. We demonstrate that a mid-circuit measurement acts as a low-energy filter when the desired outcome is obtained. When the other outcome is measured we heuristically rely on the mixer to repopulate the low energy states. Numerical simulations show that this method effectively amplifies the ground state. We validate our approach on real quantum hardware namely the IBM Quantum system one ibm_quebec.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways, on or off. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decompositional theories describe the ways in which a global physical system can be split into subsystems, facilitating the study of how different possible partitions of a same system interplay, e.g. in terms of inclusions or signalling. In quantum theory, subsystems are usually framed as sub-C* algebras of the algebra of operators on the global system. However, most decompositional approaches have so far restricted their scope to the case of systems corresponding to factor algebras. We argue that this is a mistake: one should cater for the possibility for non-factor subsystems, arising for instance from symmetry considerations. Building on simple examples, we motivate and present a definition of partitions into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is a possibly non-factor sub-C* algebra. We discuss its physical interpretation and study its properties, in particular with regards to the structure of algebras' centres. We prove that partitions, defined at the C*-algebraic level, can be represented in terms of a splitting of Hilbert spaces, using the framework of routed quantum circuits. For some partitions, however, such a representation necessarily retains a residual pseudo-nonlocality. We provide an example of this behaviour, given by the partition of a fermionic system into local modes.</description>

Abstract: Differential sensitivity techniques originally developed to study the robustness of energy landscape controllers are generalized to the important case of closed quantum systems subject to continuously varying controls. Vanishing sensitivity to parameter variation is shown to coincide with perfect fidelity, as was the case for time-invariant controls. Upper bounds on the magnitude of the differential sensitivity to any parameter variation are derived based simply on knowledge of the system Hamiltonian and the maximum size of the control inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry is highly susceptible to inertial acceleration noises arising from the vibration of the experimental apparatus. There are various methods for noise suppression. In this paper, we propose leveraging the cross-correlation of multi-directional vibration noises to mitigate their dephasing effect in matter-wave interferometers. Specifically, we analyse an interferometer driven by its internal state under an external field and examine the dephasing caused by a two-dimensional random inertial force. As we will demonstrate, the coupling between the two-dimensional inertial force noise components will shift the resonance peak but not change the shape of the power spectral density. Moreover, when the noise approximately resonates with the intrinsic frequency of the test mass, we find that the standard deviation of the phase can be suppressed by a factor roughly equal to the Q-factor of the noise. This technique holds significant potential for future gravity experiments utilising quantum sensors, such as measuring gravitational acceleration and exploring quantum entanglement induced by gravity.</description>

Abstract: Quantum relays are central to both quantum communication and distributed quantum computing, enabling long-distance transmission and modular architectures. Unlike classical repeaters, quantum repeaters preserve coherence without amplifying quantum information, relying on entanglement swapping and quantum error correction to overcome loss and decoherence. In this work, we investigate the transmission of quantum information via quantum relay channels. Our three-terminal relay model captures the trade-off between repeater-assisted and repeaterless communication strategies. Specifically, we propose a partial decode-forward strategy, in which quantum ``message system" consists of two components. The first component is decoded by the relay and then sent to the destination receiver, whereas the second component is decoded by the destination receiver without the relay's help. We analyze both entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios. As a special case, the full decode-forward strategy is recovered, with the relay decoding, re-encoding, and forwarding the entire message. Our framework allows for different entanglement topologies between the transmitter, the relay and the destination receiver, recovering known results on entanglement-assisted and unassisted communication. Furthermore, we discuss the interpretation of coding with quantum side information. These findings provide a foundation for designing secure, efficient, and reliable quantum networks and for realizing practical quantum repeaters and long-range quantum key distribution.</description>

Abstract: Four-component Schr\"odinger cat (4C) states are important physical resources for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the generation of 4C states in solid-state platforms remains challenging due to stringent nonlinearity requirements. In this paper, a Floquet-engineering scheme is proposed for generating 4C states in a hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor system. Numerical simulations show that the high-fidelity 4C states can be generated even if the decoherence of the system is considered. These results provide a scalable route to multi-component cat-state engineering in solid-state platforms and open new avenues for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Geometry of quantum states and chaos-integrability transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the geometry of quantum states associated with different classes of random matrix Hamiltonians, in particular ensembles that show integrability to chaotic transition in terms of the nearest neighbour energy level spacing distribution. In the case that the total Hamiltonian contains a single parameter, the distance between two states is captured by the fidelity susceptibility, whereas, when the total Hamiltonian contains multiple parameters, this distance is given in terms of the quantum metric tensor. Since the fidelity susceptibility is closely related to the two-point correlation function, we first calculate the relevant correlation functions of a random matrix belonging to the Gaussian unitary ensemble in terms of the spectral form factor of the total Hamiltonian, show how to obtain the fidelity susceptibility from this correlation function, and explain the role played by energy level correlation. Next, by performing suitable coordinate transformations, we solve the geodesic equations corresponding to the quantum metric tensor obtained from an integrability-breaking random matrix Hamiltonian and obtain the geodesic distance between two points on the parameter manifold to show that any point far away from the integrable phase can be reached by a finite value of this distance. Finally, we obtain and discuss different properties of the fidelity susceptibility associated with Hamiltonians belonging to another random matrix ensemble which shows integrability to chaos transition, namely the Gaussian $\beta$-ensembles with general values of the Dyson index $\beta$, and show that the fidelity susceptibility shares generic features with the first class of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Gain on ground state of quantum system for truly $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum system, the conventional non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is $H = \Omega\sigma_x -i\gamma|1\rangle\langle1| + i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$, where $\Omega$ and $\gamma$ are real parameters and $\sigma_x$ denotes Pauli X operator. These three terms represent coherent coupling, loss (on state $|1\rangle$), and gain (on state $|0\rangle$), respectively. Although the works in [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{101}, 230404 (2008); Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{119}, 190401 (2017); Science \textbf{364}, 878 (2019)] proposed theoretically and/or demonstrate dilation methods for a truly parity-time($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric Hamiltonian by embedding into larger Hermitian space, directly realizing the gain term $+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$ has still remained an outstanding challenge for quantum system. While systems omitting this gain term can exhibit a passively $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric energy spectrum (featuring a parallel imaginary shift) and display related phenomena, they fail to capture the full physical behavior and unique properties inherent to truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems. In this manuscript, we propose a method to achieve effective gain on the ground state $|0\rangle$ ($+i\gamma|0\rangle\langle0|$) after averaging all trajectories, by integrating the S{\o}rensen-Reiter effective operator method with the Wiseman-Milburn master equation for continuous measurement and instantaneous feedback control after averaging the evolution over all trajectories. This approach provides a possible pathway to efficiently construct truly $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum devices, offering a powerful platform for engineering quantum resources vital for quantum information technology applications.</description>

      <title>Long-range photonic device-independent quantum key distribution using SPDC sources and linear optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of the implementation of long distance device-independent quantum key distribution (DI QKD) by proposing two experimentally viable schemes. Those schemes only use spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) sources and linear optics. They achieve favorable key rate scaling proportional to the square root of channel transmissivity $\eta_t$, matching the twin-field protocol advantage. We demonstrate positive asymptotic key rates at detector efficiencies as low as 81\%, bringing DI QKD within the reach of current superconducting detector technology. Our security analysis employs the Entropy Accumulation Theorem to establish rigorous finite-size bounds, achieving finite-key rates at a detector efficiency of 89\%. This work represents a critical milestone toward device-independent security in quantum communication networks, providing experimentalists with practical implementation pathways while maintaining the strongest possible security guarantees against quantum adversaries.</description>

      <title>Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</description>

Abstract: The Hubbard model is a challenging quantum many-body problem and serves as a benchmark for quantum computing research. Accurate computation of its ground and excited state energies is essential for understanding correlated electron systems. In this study, the ground, first, and second excited state energies of 4$\times$1 and 2$\times$2 Hubbard lattices are obtained using a newly designed ansatz circuit. The ansatz is constructed by combining concepts from the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and the Number-Preserving Ansatz (NPA). A hybrid optimization strategy is applied, where COBYLA is used for coarse convergence and L-BFGS for fine-tuning. The resulting energies are evaluated, and the corresponding physical properties of the systems are analyzed through phase diagrams of the energy excitation gaps for different charge and spin configurations.</description>

Abstract: The flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce the Quantum Flow Matching (QFM-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating observables, and can be realized on quantum computers without the need for costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications: (i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for generative modeling across quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The framework of Keldysh path integral concisely describes quantum systems driven away from thermal equilibrium, such as the two-photon driven Kerr oscillator. Within the thermodynamic limit of diverging photon occupation, we map it to a Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis path integral, and obtain a purely classical, stochastic equivalent where photon self-interaction plays the role of temperature. This perspective sheds light on the difficulties encountered in the search for an effective thermodynamic potential to describe the bistability of the model. It allows us to estimate the bistable tunneling rates using a real-time instanton technique leading to an analytical expression of the phase boundary, the first to our knowledge. It opens the way to powerful semi-analytical techniques to be applied to various quantum optics models displaying bistability.</description>

Abstract: Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV$^-$) centers and other color centers in diamonds have emerged as promising platforms for quantum communication, quantum information processing, and nanoscale sensing, owing to their long spin coherence times, fast spin control, and efficient photon coupling. Deterministic placement of individual color centers into nanophotonic structures is critical for scalable device integration, and ion implantation is the most viable technique. Nanofabrication processes, including diamond etching, are essential to realize these structures but can introduce crystal strain through lattice damage. In this work, we investigate the impact of ion implantation and nanofabrication-induced strain on the electronic spin levels of NV$^-$ centers. We demonstrate that the zero-field continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) spectrum serves as a sensitive probe of local crystal strain, providing both quantitative and directional information. Furthermore, we present a model that explains the strain-induced features observed in the ODMR spectra of the single NV$^-$ center, offering a framework to characterize the strain effects in diamond-based nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the charging dynamics of a quantum battery coupled to a structured reservoir composed of two qubits, each in thermal equilibrium with its own bosonic bath. The structured reservoir interacts with a charger battery model through three distinct configurations: (I) direct coupling between the reservoir qubits and the battery, (II) common coupling between the reservoir qubits, the charger, and the battery, and (III) common coupling between the reservoir qubits and the charger, together with a local charger battery interaction. For both incoherent and coherent initial states, we analyze the stored energy, ergotropy, and charging power of the battery, and establish upper and lower bounds on the maximum extractable work of the battery based on the free energy of coherence, and exchanged correlations between the subsystems. Our results show that the nature of the interaction scenario and the presence of coherence crucially determine the efficiency of charging and the maximum ergotropy. We demonstrate that correlation exchange between subsystems, quantified by the difference between global and local coherence, acts as a resource for work extraction. These findings provide a deeper understanding of coherence and population and structured environments as resources for autonomous quantum batteries, and offer experimentally accessible predictions within the regime of superconducting qubits.</description>

Abstract: Here we suggest a modification of Grover's algorithm, based on a multiphase oracle which marks each solution with a different phase when there is more than one solution. Such a modification can be used to maintain a high probability of finding a solution for a number of iterations equal to or more than the one required by the deterministic Grover's algorithm (the one based on generalized Householder reflections). We use various semiempirical methods to show that the interval of number of iterations for which the algorithm keeps the probability of finding solution high depends on the register size and the oracle phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate optical integration using heralded single photons and explore the influence of spatial correlations between photons on this process. Specifically, we experimentally harness the transverse spatial degrees of freedom of light within an optical processing framework based on heralded single photons. The integration is performed over binary phase patterns encoded via a phase-only spatial light modulator, with polarization serving as an auxiliary degree of freedom. Our findings reveal a distinct contrast in how spatial correlations affect image analysis: spatially uncorrelated photons are more effective at capturing the global features of an image encoded in the modulator, whereas spatially correlated photons exhibit enhanced sensitivity to local image details. Importantly, the optical integration scheme presented here bears a strong conceptual and operational resemblance to the DQC1 (Deterministic Quantum Computation with One Qubit) model. This connection underscores the potential of our approach for quantum-enhanced information processing, even in regimes where entanglement is minimal or absent.</description>

      <title>Statistical Invisibility of a Physical Attack on QRNGs After Randomness Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current prevailing designs of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) designs typically employ post-processing techniques to distill raw random data, followed by statistical verification with suites like NIST SP 800-22. This paper demonstrates that this widely adopted practice harbors a critical flaw. We show that the powerful extraction process can create a false sense of security by perfectly concealing physical-layer attacks, rendering the subsequent statistical tests blind to a compromised entropy source. We substantiate this claim across two major QRNG architectures. Experimentally, we severely compromise an QRNG based on amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with a power supply ripple attack. While the resulting raw data catastrophically fails NIST tests, a standard Toeplitz extraction transforms it into a final sequence that passes flawlessly. This outcome highlights a profound danger: since the validation process is insensitive to the quality of the raw data, it implies that even a fully predictable input could be processed to produce a certified, yet completely insecure, random sequence. Our theoretical analysis confirms this vulnerability extends to phase-noise-based QRNGs, suggesting a need for security validation to evolve beyond statistical analysis of the final output and consider the entire generation process.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Randomness and Probabilistic Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply recent ideas about complexity and randomness to the philosophy of laws and chances. We develop two ways to use algorithmic randomness to characterize probabilistic laws of nature. The first, a generative chance* law, employs a nonstandard notion of chance. The second, a probabilistic* constraining law, impose relative frequency and randomness constraints that every physically possible world must satisfy. The constraining notion removes a major obstacle to a unified governing account of non-Humean laws, on which laws govern by constraining physical possibilities; it also provides independently motivated solutions to familiar problems for the Humean best-system account (the Big Bad Bug and the zero-fit problem). On either approach, probabilistic laws are tied more tightly to corresponding sets of possible worlds: some histories permitted by traditional probabilistic laws are now ruled out as physically impossible. Consequently, the framework avoids one variety of empirical underdetermination while bringing to light others that are typically overlooked.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pathways for Charged Track Finding in High-Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In high-energy particle collisions, charged track finding is a complex yet crucial endeavour. We propose a quantum algorithm, specifically quantum template matching, to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of track finding. Abstracting the Quantum Amplitude Amplification routine by introducing a data register, and utilising a novel oracle construction, allows data to be parsed to the circuit and matched with a hit-pattern template, without prior knowledge of the input data. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by missing hit data, demonstrating the ability of the quantum template matching algorithm to successfully identify charged-particle tracks from hit patterns with missing hits. Our findings therefore propose quantum methodologies tailored for real-world applications and underline the potential of quantum computing in collider physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.</description>

      <title>Density and unitarity of the Burau representation from a non-semisimple TQFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the density of the Burau representation from the perspective of a non-semisimple TQFT at a fourth root of unity. This gives a TQFT construction of Squier's Hermitian form on the Burau representation with possibly mixed signature. We prove that the image of the braid group in the space of possibly indefinite unitary representations is dense. We also argue for the potential applications of non-semisimple TQFTs toward topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Probing $CP$ violation and mass ordering in neutrino oscillations in matter through quantum speed limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum speed limits (QSLs) set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve from a given initial state to a final state. In this work, we investigate $CP$ violation and the mass ordering problem of neutrino oscillations in matter using the QSL time as a key analytical tool. We examine the QSL time for the unitary evolution of two- and three-flavor neutrino states, both in vacuum and in the presence of matter. Two-flavor neutrino oscillations are used as a precursor to their three-flavor counterparts. We further compute the QSL time for neutrino state evolution and entanglement in terms of neutrino survival and oscillation probabilities, which are experimentally measurable quantities in neutrino experiments. A difference in the QSL time between the normal and inverted mass ordering scenarios, for neutrino state evolution as well as for entanglement, under the effect of a $CP$ violation phase is observed. Our results are illustrated using the length scales and energies of ongoing long-baseline accelerator neutrino experiments such as T2K, NOvA, and the upcoming DUNE experiment. Notably, three-flavor neutrino oscillations in constant matter density exhibit faster state evolution across all these neutrino experiments in the normal mass ordering scenario. Additionally, we observe fast entanglement suppression in DUNE assuming a normal mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Theory, Spectral Path Integrals and Exact-WKB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new way to perform path integrals in quantum mechanics by using a quantum version of Hamilton-Jacobi theory. In classical mechanics, Hamilton-Jacobi theory is a powerful formalism, however, its utility is not explored in quantum theory beyond approximation schemes. The canonical transformation enables one to set the new Hamiltonian to constant or zero, but keeps the information about solution in Hamilton's characteristic function. To benefit from this in quantum theory, one must work with a formulation in which classical Hamiltonian is used. This uniquely points to phase space path integral. However, the main variable in HJ-formalism is energy, not time. Thus, we are led to consider Fourier transform of path integral, spectral path integral, $\tilde Z(E)$. The evaluation of path integral reduces to determining the quantum Hamilton's characteristic functions (which can be achieved via an asymptotic analysis), and a discrete sum over the quantum period lattice, generalizing Gutzwiller's sum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review some classic works on ground state entanglement entropy in $(1+1)$-dimensional free scalar field theory. We point out identifications between the methods for the calculation of entanglement entropy and we show how the formalism developed for the discretized theory can be utilized in order to obtain results in the continuous theory. We specify the entanglement spectrum and we calculate the entanglement entropy for the theory defined on an interval of finite length $L$. Finally, we derive the modular Hamiltonian directly, without using the modular flow, via the continuous limit of the expressions obtained in the discretized theory. In a specific coordinate system, the modular Hamiltonian assumes the form of a free field Hamiltonian on the Rindler wedge.</description>

      <title>A Numerical Calculation of Entanglement Entropy in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of a massless scalar field in de Sitter space depends on multiple scales, such as the radius of the entangling surface, the Hubble constant and the UV cutoff. We perform a high-precision numerical calculation using a lattice model in order to determine the dependence on these scales in the Bunch-Davies vacuum. We derive the leading de Sitter corrections to the flat-space entanglement entropy for subhorizon entangling radii. We analyze the structure of the finite-size effects and we show that the contribution to the entanglement entropy of the sector of the theory with vanishing angular momentum depends logarithmically on the size of the overall system, which extends beyond the horizon.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of purification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, 8-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensemble, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent Time Division Multiplexing with Solid-State Integrated Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</description>

      <title>Post-measurement Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how the effects of large numbers of measurements on many-body quantum ground and thermal states can be studied using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). Density matrices generated by measurement in this setting feature products of many local nonunitary operators, and by expanding these density matrices as sums over operator strings we arrive at a generalized stochastic series expansion (SSE). Our 'post-measurement SSE' is based on importance sampling of operator strings contributing to a measured thermal density matrix. We demonstrate our algorithm by probing the effects of measurements on the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice. Thermal states of this system have SU(2) symmetry, and at first we preserve this symmetry by measuring SU(2) symmetric observables. We identify classes of post-measurement states for which correlations can be calculated efficiently, as well as states for which SU(2) symmetric measurements generate a QMC sign problem when working in any site-local basis. For the first class, we show how deterministic loop updates can be leveraged. Using our algorithm we demonstrate the creation of long-range Bell pairs and symmetry-protected topological order, as well as the measurement-induced enhancement of antiferromagnetic correlations. We then study the effects of measuring the system in a basis where the standard (unmeasured) SSE is sign-free: For measurement schemes with this property, we can calculate correlations in all post-measurement states without a sign problem. The method developed in this work opens the door to scalable experimental probes of measurement-induced collective phenomena, which require numerical estimates for the effects of measurements.</description>

      <title>Strong photon coupling to high-frequency antiferromagnetic magnons via topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18307v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field with the potential to drive scientific, educational, and technological development. However, it faces a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further widening the regional talent and access gap due to limited educational infrastructure and financial constraints. This work presents an initiative to integrate quantum computing into higher education in Latin America through the application of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a cryogenic electro-optic sampling (EOS) setup that allows for the measurement of microwave signals at arbitrary positions on a cryogenic chip-scale device. We use a Josephson Arbitrary Waveform Synthesizer (JAWS) to generate quantum-accurate voltage signals and measure them with the EOS setup, allowing for the calibration of its response, yielding traceability of the microwave measurements to a quantum standard. We use the EOS setup to determine the time-domain response of ultrafast cryogenic photodiodes and the electrical reflection coefficient, i.e., the S11 scattering parameter, in a superconducting transmission line. Finally, we introduce an optical femtosecond pulse source which can be used to study the fidelity of superconducting transmission lines and terminations, as well as reflections from elements like Josephson junction arrays imbedded in them.</description>

      <title>A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Hoare-style logic for reasoning about quantum programs with classical variables. Our approach offers several improvements over previous work:
  (1) Enhanced expressivity of the programming language: Our logic applies to quantum programs with classical variables that incorporate quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, which have not been addressed in previous research on quantum Hoare logic, either with or without classical variables.
  (2) Intuitive correctness specifications: In our logic, preconditions and postconditions for quantum programs with classical variables are specified as a pair consisting of a classical first-order logical formula and a quantum predicate formula (possibly parameterised by classical variables). These specifications offer greater clarity and align more closely with the programmer's intuitive understanding of quantum and classical interactions.
  (3) Simplified proof system: By introducing a novel idea in formulating a proof rule for reasoning about quantum measurements, along with (2), we develop a proof system for quantum programs that requires only minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. Furthermore, this proof system can be effectively and conveniently combined with classical first-order logic to verify quantum programs with classical variables.
  As a result, the learning curve for quantum program verification techniques is significantly reduced for those already familiar with classical program verification techniques, and existing tools for verifying classical programs can be more easily adapted for quantum program verification.</description>

      <title>Relational Observables in Group Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct relational observables in group field theory (GFT) in terms of covariant positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), using techniques developed in the context of quantum reference frames. We focus on matter quantum reference frames; this can be generalized to other types of frames within the same POVM-based framework. The resulting family of relational observables provides a covariant framework to extract localized observables from GFT, which is typically defined in a perspective-neutral way. Then, we compare this formalism with previous proposals for relational observables in GFT. We find that our quantum reference frame-based relational observables overcome the intrinsic limitations of previous proposals while reproducing the same continuum limit results concerning expectation values of the number and volume operators on coherent states. Nonetheless, there can be important differences for more complex operators, as well as for other types of GFT states. Finally, we also use a specific class of POVMs to show how to project states and operators from the more general perspective-neutral GFT Fock space to a perspective-dependent one where a scalar matter field plays the role of a relational clock.</description>

      <title>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</description>

      <title>Investigating Parameter-Efficiency of Hybrid QuGANs Based on Geometric Properties of Generated Sea Route Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08678v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for artificially generated data for the development, training and testing of new algorithms is omnipresent. Quantum computing (QC), does offer the hope that its inherent probabilistic functionality can be utilised in this field of generative artificial intelligence. In this study, we use quantum-classical hybrid generative adversarial networks (QuGANs) to artificially generate graphs of shipping routes. We create a training dataset based on real shipping data and investigate to what extent QuGANs are able to learn and reproduce inherent distributions and geometric features of this data. We compare hybrid QuGANs with classical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with a special focus on their parameter efficiency. Our results indicate that QuGANs are indeed able to quickly learn and represent underlying geometric properties and distributions, although they seem to have difficulties in introducing variance into the sampled data. Compared to classical GANs of greater size, measured in the number of parameters used, some QuGANs show similar result quality. Our reference to concrete use cases, such as the generation of shipping data, provides an illustrative example and demonstrate the potential and diversity in which QC can be used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sphere-packing bound quantifies the error exponent for noisy channel coding for rates above a critical value. Here, we study the zero-rate limit of the sphere-packing bound and show that it has an intriguing single-letter form, which we call the umlaut information of the channel, inspired by the lautum information introduced by Palomar and Verd\'u. Unlike the latter quantity, we show that the umlaut information is additive for parallel uses of channels. We show that it has a twofold operational interpretation: as the zero-rate error exponent of non-signalling-assisted coding on the one hand, and as the zero-rate error exponent of list decoding in the large list limit on the other.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum speed limit and entanglement in flavor oscillations of neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gutzwiller projection of fermionic wave functions is a well-established method for generating variational wave functions describing exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids. We investigate the conditions under which a projected wave function constructed from fermionic partons can be rigorously shown to possess topological order. We demonstrate that these conditions can be precisely determined in the case of projected Majorana stabilizer codes. We then use matrix product states to study states that interpolate between two distinct Majorana fermion codes, one yielding a $\mathbb Z_2$ spin liquid and the other a trivial polarized state upon projection. While the free-fermion states are adiabatically connected, we find that the projected states undergo a phase transition detected by the topological entanglement entropy. Our work underscores the profound impact of the Gutzwiller projection and cautions against inferring properties of quantum spin liquids solely from their unprojected counterparts.</description>

      <title>Single-atom imaging of ${}^{173}$Yb in optical tweezers loaded by a five-beam magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the trapping and imaging of individual ytterbium atoms in arrays of optical tweezers, loaded from a magneto-optical trap (MOT) formed by only five beams in an orthogonal configuration. In our five-beam MOT, operating on the narrow ${}^1$S${}_0 \rightarrow {}^3$P${}_1$ intercombination transition, gravity balances the radiation pressure of a single upward-directed beam. This approach enables efficient trapping and cooling of the most common ytterbium isotopes (${}^{171}$Yb, ${}^{173}$Yb and ${}^{174}$Yb) to $\lesssim 20\,\mu$K at densities $\sim 10^{11}$ atoms/cm$^3$ within less than one second. This configuration allows for significantly reducing the complexity of the optical setup, potentially benefiting any ytterbium-atom based quantum science platform leveraging single-atom microscopy, from quantum processors to novel optical clocks. We then demonstrate the first single-atom-resolved imaging of the fermionic, large-spin isotope ${}^{173}$Yb ($I=5/2$), employing a two-color imaging scheme that does not rely on magic-wavelength trapping. We achieve a high single-atom detection fidelity of $99.96(1)\%$ and a large survival probability of $98.5(2)\%$, despite large differential light shifts affecting all nuclear spin sublevels of the excited ${}^3$P${}_1$ state involved in the cooling transition. The demonstrated capabilities will play a key role in future quantum simulations and computing applications with ${}^{173}$Yb arrays.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating axion-mediated interactions in RaOH molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If axion simultaneously has the scalar couplings to the nucleons and pseudo-scalar couplings to the electrons, it may mediate a $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$-violating interaction between the electronic shell and nuclei in the molecules. The polyatomic molecule RaOH, which is considered as a promising platform for the $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{T}$ violation searches, is studied for its sensitivity to such interactions. Due to the long-range nature (on molecular scales) of the axion-mediated interaction, it is important whether the enhancement parameter would be sensitive to the vibration of the molecule. Our results imply that the impact of the vibrations on the axion-mediated electron-nucleon interaction in the molecule is similar to the impact on the short-range electron-nucleon scalar-pseudoscalar interaction studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Floquet M\"obius topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: M\"obius topological insulators have dispersive edge bands with M\"obius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and $Z_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of M\"obius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized M\"obius insulator model, we obtain interconnected M\"obius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These M\"obius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such M\"obius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet M\"obius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of M\"obius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of M\"obius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study SU($N$) spin systems that mimic the behavior of particles in $N$-dimensional de Sitter space for $N=2,3$. Their Hamiltonians describe a dynamical system with hyperbolic fixed points, leading to emergent quasinormal modes at the quantum level. These manifest as quasiparticle peaks in the density of states. For a particle in 2-dimensional de Sitter, we find both principal and complementary series densities of states from a PT-symmetric version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, having two hyperbolic fixed points in the classical phase space. We then study different spectral and dynamical properties of this class of models, including level spacing statistics, two-point functions, squared commutators, spectral form factor, Krylov operator and state complexity. We find that, even though the early-time properties of these quantities are governed by the saddle points -- thereby in some cases mimicking corresponding properties of chaotic systems, a close look at the late-time behavior reveals the integrable nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Sectors in Chord Space and Relational Holography in the DSSYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In holography, gauging symmetries of the boundary theory leads to important modifications in the bulk. In this work, we study constraints to gauge symmetry sectors in the chord Hilbert space of the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) with matter, and we connect them to different proposals of its bulk dual. These sectors include chord parity symmetry, corresponding to End-Of-The-World (ETW) branes and Euclidean wormholes in sine dilaton gravity; and relative time-translations in a doubled DSSYK model (resulting from a single DSSYK with an infinitely heavy matter chord) used in de Sitter holography. We define and evaluate partition functions and thermal correlation functions of the ETW brane and Euclidean wormhole systems in the boundary theory. We deduce the holographic dictionary by matching geodesic lengths in the bulk with the spread complexity of the parity-gauged DSSYK. The Euclidean wormholes of fixed size are perturbatively stable, and their baby universe Hilbert space is non-trivial only when matter is added. We conclude studying the constraints in the path integral of the doubled DSSYK. We derive the gauge invariant operator algebra of one of the DSSYKs dressed to the other one and discuss its holographic interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23879v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic, quantum electrodynamics, as well as non-adiabatic corrections and couplings, are computed for the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$ and c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ electronic states of the helium dimer. The underlying Born-Oppenheimer potential energy curves are converged to 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) relative precision using a variational explicitly correlated Gaussian approach. The quantum nuclear motion is computed over the b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ (and B $^1\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-C $^1\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$) 9-(12-)dimensional electronic-spin subspace coupled by non-adiabatic and relativistic (magnetic) interactions. The electron's anomalous magnetic moment is also included; its effect is expected to be visible in high-resolution experiments. The computed rovibronic energy intervals are in excellent agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data, including the rovibronic b $^3\Pi_\mathrm{g}$-state fine structure. Fine-structure splittings are also predicted for the c $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{g}^+$ levels, which have not been fully resolved experimentally, yet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>AEGISS -- Atomic orbital and Entropy-based Guided Inference for Space Selection -- A novel semi-automated active space selection workflow for quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of a balanced active space is a critical step in multi-reference quantum chemistry calculations, particularly for systems with strong electron correlation. Likewise, active space selection is a key to unlock the potential of contemporary quantum computing in quantum chemistry. Albeit recent progress, there remains a lack of a unified, robust, and fully automated framework for active space selection that performs reliably across a wide range of molecular systems.
  In this work, we present a novel approach inspired by both the AVAS (Atomic Valence Active Space) and AutoCAS methods. Our method unifies orbital entropy analysis with atomic orbital projections to guide the construction of chemically and physically meaningful active spaces. This integrated scheme enables a more consistent and flexible selection of active orbitals while retaining automation and scalability. We validate our approach on a set of molecular systems relevant to photodynamic therapy, in particular a set of Ru(II)-complexes, selected to span increasing levels of electron correlation and structural complexity. These molecules serve as challenging test cases due to the presence of strong static correlation and the need for highly accurate electronic structure descriptions. Our results demonstrate that the method can reliably identify compact, chemically intuitive active spaces that capture the essential physics, making it suitable for both classical and quantum computational frameworks.
  Furthermore, we have developed this approach in a package that is intuitive to use for users and can be interfaced with both standard quantum chemistry and quantum computing applications, making it accessible to a broad research community.</description>

      <title>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.</description>

      <title>Correlated decoherence and thermometry with mobile impurities in a 1D Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the correlated decoherence dynamics of two mobile impurities trapped within a gas of ultracold fermionic atoms. We use a mean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of impurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the impurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant approach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced localisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then study the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the impurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey interferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of impurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the universal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when the mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show that mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and that bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance at low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our results showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities dephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise temperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.</description>
