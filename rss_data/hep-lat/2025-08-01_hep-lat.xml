      <title>Field digitization scaling in a $\mathbb{Z}_N \subset U(1)$ symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of quantum field theories, both classical and quantum, requires regularization of infinitely many degrees of freedom. However, in the context of field digitization (FD) -- a truncation of the local fields to $N$ discrete values -- a comprehensive framework to obtain continuum results is currently missing. Here, we propose to analyze FD by interpreting the parameter $N$ as a coupling in the renormalization group (RG) sense. As a first example, we investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field theory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the FD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different $N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\textit{field digitization scaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension $\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover around a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating that FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\chi$ and $N$. Finally, we analytically prove that our calculations for the 2D classical-statistical $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model are directly related to the quantum physics in the ground state of a (2+1)D $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory which serves as a FD of compact quantum electrodynamics. Our study thus paves the way for applications of FDS to quantum simulations of more complex models in higher spatial dimensions, where it could serve as a tool to analyze the continuum limit of digitized quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Probing Bound State Relaxation Dynamics in Systems Out-of-Equilibrium on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing response dynamics of quantum many-body systems in and out-of-equilibrium. Quantum computers have proved useful in simulating such experiments by exciting the system, evolving, and then measuring observables to first order, all in one setting. Here, we use this approach to investigate the mixed-field Ising model, where the longitudinal field plays the role of a confining potential that prohibits the spread of the excitations, spinons, or domain walls into space. We study the discrete bound states that arise from such a setting and their evolution under different quench dynamics by initially pumping the chain out of equilibrium and then probing various non-equal time correlation functions. Finally, we study false vacuum decay, where initially one expects unhindered propagation of the ground state, or true vacuum, bubbles into the lattice, but instead sees the emergence of Bloch oscillations that are directly the reason for the long-lived oscillations in this finite-size model. Our work sets the stage for simulating systems out-of-equilibrium on classical and quantum computers using pump-probe experiments without needing ancillary qubits.</description>

      <title>A Perturbative Approach to Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm has been a powerful framework for understanding phase transitions involving spontaneous symmetry breaking. In contrast, phase transitions between two symmetric phases, where neither phase breaks any symmetry, remain less explored. One intriguing class of such transitions involves "symmetric mass generation" (SMG), where interactions drive a transition from a gapless symmetric phase to a gapped symmetric phase. In this work, we develop a controlled perturbative approach to study a class of such transitions, based on an $\epsilon$-expansion around the critical dimension where the SMG-inducing-interaction becomes marginal. Applying this method to two distinct models, we identify a single-parameter-tuned transition in each case, which we conjecture captures the universal critical behavior of the SMG transition in these models. We compute universal quantities associated with these transitions.</description>

      <title>Revealing chiral-odd two-meson generalized distribution amplitudes in $e^- e^+ \to (\pi \pi) (\pi \pi)$ reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that chiral-odd dimeson generalized distribution amplitudes (CO-GDAs)-nonperturbative objects encoding the transition of a quark-antiquark pair into two mesons-can be accessed in high-energy $e^- e^+$ annihilation into two meson pairs, each with a relatively low invariant mass. While chiral-even GDAs contribute to the leading one-photon amplitude, the chiral-odd sector enters via two-photon exchange. We show that the interference between these amplitudes leads to measurable effects at BES III or future tau-charm factories. This work opens a direct path to experimentally probing the long-missing chiral-odd sector of meson structure-specifically, the anomalous tensorial magnetic moment of spin-zero mesons such as the pion.</description>

      <title>Subthreshold parameters of $\pi\pi$ scattering revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the most recent experimental data and lattice QCD calculations of $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths, while employing dispersive representations of the amplitude based on Roy equations, we compute the subthreshold parameters of this process. We use Monte Carlo sampling to numerically model the probability distribution of the results based on all uncertainties in the inputs. We also investigate the dependence of the results on a theoretical correlation between the $\pi\pi$ scattering lengths $a^0_0$ and $a^2_0$, which was previously established in the framework of two-flavour chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Applying the Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo method to the Hubbard model away from half filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Worldvolume Hybrid Monte Carlo (WV-HMC) method [arXiv:2012.08468] is an efficient and low-cost algorithm for addressing the sign problem. It mitigates the sign problem while avoiding the ergodicity issues that are intrinsic to algorithms based on Lefschetz thimbles. In this study, we apply the WV-HMC method to the Hubbard model away from half filling, which is known to suffer from a severe sign problem. We compute the number density on lattices of spatial size $6 \times 6$ and $8 \times 8$ at inverse temperature $\beta = 6.4$ using $N_t = 20$ Trotter steps. Our results show that the WV-HMC method remains effective even in parameter regions where non-thimble Monte Carlo methods fail due to severe sign problems. In this work, we employ direct solvers for fermion matrix inversion, with a computational cost of $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom and proportional to the spacetime lattice volume. An alternative algorithm employing pseudofermions and iterative solvers, which reduces the cost to $O(N^2)$ at the expense of careful parameter tuning, will be discussed in a separate publication.</description>

      <title>Scale-anomaly-induced confining pressure within hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of the QCD scale anomaly on the internal pressure distribution of hadrons is studied based on the trace-traceless decomposition of the energy-momentum tensor. Using recent model-independent results of gravitational form factors as input, the pressure distributions of both pions and nucleons are analyzed in the instant form and the light-front form. It is found that, in all cases, the scale anomaly dominantly generates the confining pressure. This result suggests that the phenomenon is a universal feature, independent of models, types of hadrons, and the choice of form.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative signatures of fractons in the twisted multiflavor Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge-field configurations with nontrivial topology have profound consequences for the physics of Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. Over time, arguments have been gathering for the existence of gauge-field configurations with fractional topological charge, called fractons. Ground-state properties of gauge theories can drastically change in presence of fractons in the path integral. However, understanding the origin of such fractons is usually restricted to semiclassical argumentation. Here, we show that fractons persist in strongly correlated many-body systems, using the multiflavor Schwinger model of quantum electrodynamics as a paradigm example. Through detailed numerical tensor-network analysis, we find strong fracton signatures even in highly discretized lattice models, at sizes that are implementable on already existing quantum-simulation devices. Our work sheds light on how the nontrivial topology of gauge theories persists in challenging nonperturbative regimes, and it shows a path forward to probing it in tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>Rigorous Roy-Steiner equation analysis of $\pi K$ scattering at unphysical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a rigorous analysis of the $\pi K$ scattering at an unphysical pion mass 391 MeV using the Roy-Steiner equations, which satisfy unitarity, analyticity and crossing symmetry, for the first time. Stable solutions of the Roy-Steiner equations with different quantum numbers of isospin and angular momentum are obtained in the elastic energy region, by taking inputs from the $\pi K$ lattice data in the inelastic region, the lattice data from the crossed $\pi\pi \to K\bar{K}$ channels, the masses of $f_0(500)$ and $K^*$ at the same pion mass from previous study, and the Regge model. Predictions on the elastic $\pi K$ scattering phase shifts and the $K_0^*(700)$ pole content are made. Contrary to the virtual pole scenario obtained using the $K$-matrix method in the literature, we find that lightest strange scalar meson $K_0^*(700)$ remains a broad resonance at $m_\pi=391$ MeV. The cross-channel dynamics is found to play a crucial role in deriving the proper pole position.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>
