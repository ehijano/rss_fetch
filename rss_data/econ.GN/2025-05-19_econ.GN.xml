      <title>The Impact of Large Language Models on Task Automation in Manufacturing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) for task automation in the provision of technical services in the production machinery sector. By focusing on text correction, summarization, and question answering, the study demonstrates how LLMs can enhance operational efficiency and customer support quality. Through prototyping and the analysis of real-life customer data, LLMs are shown to reliably correct errors, generate concise summaries of complex communication, and provide accurate, context-aware responses to customer inquiries. The research also integrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine LLM outputs with domain-specific knowledge, enhancing precision and relevance. While the findings highlight significant efficiency gains, challenges such as knowledge hallucination and integration with human workflows remain barriers to large-scale adoption. This study contributes to the theoretical understanding and practical application of LLMs in manufacturing, paving the way for further research into scalable, domain-specific implementations.</description>

      <title>Humans expect rationality and cooperation from LLM opponents in strategic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into our social and economic interactions, we need to deepen our understanding of how humans respond to LLMs opponents in strategic settings. We present the results of the first controlled monetarily-incentivised laboratory experiment looking at differences in human behaviour in a multi-player p-beauty contest against other humans and LLMs. We use a within-subject design in order to compare behaviour at the individual level. We show that, in this environment, human subjects choose significantly lower numbers when playing against LLMs than humans, which is mainly driven by the increased prevalence of `zero' Nash-equilibrium choices. This shift is mainly driven by subjects with high strategic reasoning ability. Subjects who play the zero Nash-equilibrium choice motivate their strategy by appealing to perceived LLM's reasoning ability and, unexpectedly, propensity towards cooperation. Our findings provide foundational insights into the multi-player human-LLM interaction in simultaneous choice games, uncover heterogeneities in both subjects' behaviour and beliefs about LLM's play when playing against them, and suggest important implications for mechanism design in mixed human-LLM systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Time: Unveiling the Invisible Burden of Mental Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, scalable methodology to measure individual perceptions of gaps in mental load -- the cognitive and emotional burden associated with organizing household and childcare tasks -- within heterosexual couples. Using original data from the TIMES Observatory in Italy, the study combines time-use diaries with new survey indicators to quantify cognitive labor, emotional fatigue, and the spillover of mental load into the workplace. Results reveal systematic gender asymmetries: women are significantly more likely than men to bear organizational responsibility for domestic tasks, report lower satisfaction with this division, and experience higher emotional fatigue. These burdens are underestimated by their partners. The effects are particularly pronounced among college-educated and employed women, who also report greater spillovers of family responsibilities than men during paid work hours. The perceived responsibility for managing family activities is more strongly associated with within-couple gaps in time use than with the absolute time spent on their execution, underscoring the relational and conflictual nature of mental load.</description>

      <title>Cosmos 1.0: a multidimensional map of the emerging technology frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes a novel methodology to map the universe of emerging technologies, utilising various source data that contain a rich diversity and breadth of contemporary knowledge to create a new dataset and multiple indices that provide new insights into these technologies. The Cosmos 1.0 dataset is a comprehensive collection of 23,544 technologies (ET23k) structured into a hierarchical model. Each technology is categorised into three meta clusters (ET3) and seven theme clusters (ET7) enhanced by 100-dimensional embedding vectors. Within the cosmos, we manually verify 100 emerging technologies called the ET100. This dataset is enriched with additional indices specifically developed to assess the landscape of emerging technologies, including the Technology Awareness Index, Generality Index, Deeptech, and Age of Tech Index. The dataset incorporates extensive metadata sourced from Wikipedia and linked data from third-party sources such as Crunchbase, Google Books, OpenAlex and Google Scholar, which are used to validate the relevance and accuracy of the constructed indices. Moreover, we trained a classifier to identify whether they are developed "technology" or technology-related "terms".</description>
