      <description>arXiv:2403.15833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this document, we examine exact and efficient numerical approaches to the MIT Bag Model, a theoretical framework used to describe the properties of bound quarks in Hadrons. We present the exact and Boundary Value Problem (BVP) numerical approaches. Both methods are effective in calculating the eigen-functions and energy levels. Notably, the precision of the BVP approach matches up to 10 decimal places when compared to the exact approach.</description>

      <title>Augmented Lagrangian method for coupled-cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to improve the convergence properties of the single-reference coupled cluster (CC) method through an augmented Lagrangian formalism. The conventional CC method changes a linear high-dimensional eigenvalue problem with exponential size into a problem of determining the roots of a nonlinear system of equations that has a manageable size. However, current numerical procedures for solving this system of equations to get the lowest eigenvalue suffer from two practical issues: First, solving the CC equations may not converge, and second, when converging, they may converge to other -- potentially unphysical -- states, which are stationary points of the CC energy expression. We show that both issues can be dealt with when a suitably defined energy is minimized in addition to solving the original CC equations. We further propose an augmented Lagrangian method for coupled cluster (alm-CC) to solve the resulting constrained optimization problem. We numerically investigate the proposed augmented Lagrangian formulation showing that the convergence towards the ground state is significantly more stable and that the optimization procedure is less susceptible to local minima. Furthermore, the computational cost of alm-CC is comparable to the conventional CC method.</description>

      <title>Automatic State Interaction with Large Localized Active Spaces for Multimetallic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The localized active space self consistent field (LASSCF) method factorizes a complete active space (CAS) wave function into an antisymmetrized product of localized active space wave function fragments. Correlation between fragments is then reintroduced through LAS state interaction (LASSI), in which the Hamiltonian is diagonalized in a model space of LAS states. However, the optimal procedure for defining the LAS fragments and LASSI model space is unknown. We here present an automated framework to explore systematically convergent sets of model spaces, which we call LASSI[$r$,$q$]. This method requires the user to select only $r$, the number of electron hops from one fragment to another and $q$, the number of fragment basis functions per Hilbert space, which converges to CASCI in the limit of $r,q\to\infty$. Numerical tests of this method on the tri-metal complexes [Fe(III)Al(III)Fe(II)($\mu_3$-O)]$^{6+}$ and [Fe(III)$_2$Fe(II)($\mu_3$-O)]$^{6+}$ show efficient convergence to the CASCI limit with 4-10 orders of magnitude fewer states.</description>

      <title>Core performance predictions in projected SPARC first-campaign plasmas with nonlinear CGYRO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work characterizes the core transport physics of SPARC early-campaign plasmas using the PORTALS-CGYRO framework. Empirical modeling of SPARC plasmas with L-mode confinement indicates an ample window of breakeven (Q&gt;1) without the need of H-mode operation. Extensive modeling of multi-channel (electron energy, ion energy and electron particle) flux-matched conditions with the nonlinear CGYRO code for turbulent transport coupled to the macroscopic plasma evolution using PORTALS reveal that the maximum fusion performance to be attained will be highly dependent on the near-edge pressure. Stiff core transport conditions are found, particularly when fusion gain approaches unity, and predicted density peaking is found to be in line with empirical databases of particle source-free H-modes. Impurity optimization is identified as a potential avenue to increase fusion performance while enabling core-edge integration. Extensive validation of the quasilinear TGLF model builds confidence in reduced-model predictions. The implications of projecting L-mode performance to high-performance and burning-plasma devices is discussed, together with the importance of predicting edge conditions.</description>

      <title>Space Group Informed Transformer for Crystalline Materials Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce CrystalFormer, a transformer-based autoregressive model specifically designed for space group-controlled generation of crystalline materials. The space group symmetry significantly simplifies the crystal space, which is crucial for data and compute efficient generative modeling of crystalline materials. Leveraging the prominent discrete and sequential nature of the Wyckoff positions, CrystalFormer learns to generate crystals by directly predicting the species and locations of symmetry-inequivalent atoms in the unit cell. Our results demonstrate that CrystalFormer matches state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for both validity, novelty, and stability of the generated crystalline materials. Our analysis also shows that CrystalFormer ingests sensible solid-state chemistry information from data for generative modeling. The CrystalFormer unifies symmetry-based structure search and generative pre-training in the realm of crystalline materials. The simplicity, generality, and flexibility of CrystalFormer position it as a promising architecture to be the foundational model of the entire crystalline materials space, heralding a new era in materials modeling and discovery.</description>

      <title>Droplet shape representation using Fourier series and autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of liquid droplets in air plays an important role in aerodynamic behavior and combustion dynamics of miniaturized propulsion systems such as microsatellites and small drones. Their precise manipulation can yield optimal efficiency in such systems. It is desired to have a minimal representation of droplet shapes using as few parameters to automate shape manipulation using self-learning algorithms, such as reinforcement learning. In this paper, we use a neural compression algorithm to represent, with only two parameters, elliptical and bullet-shaped droplets initially represented with 200 points (400 real numbers) at the droplet boundary. The mapping of many to two points is achieved in two stages. Initially, a Fourier series is formulated to approximate the contour of the droplet. Subsequently, the coefficients of this Fourier series are condensed to lower dimensions utilizing a neural network with a bottleneck architecture. Finally, 5000 synthetically generated droplet shapes were used to train the neural network. With a two real numbers representation, the recovered droplet shapes had excellent overlap with the original ones, with a mean square error 10^-3. Hence, this method compresses the droplet contour to merely two numerical parameters via a fully reversible process, a crucial feature for rendering learning algorithms computationally tractable.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: AI-assisted exploration and active design of polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing polymers with high intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) is critically important for the thermal management of organic electronics and photonics. However, this is a challenging task owing to the diversity of the chemical space and the barriers to advanced synthetic experiments/characterization techniques for polymers. In this Tutorial, the fundamentals and implementation of combining classical molecular dynamics simulation and machine learning (ML) for the development of polymers with high TC are comprehensively introduced. We begin by describing the core components of a universal ML framework, involving polymer datasets, property calculators, feature engineering and informatics algorithms. Then, the process of constructing interpretable regression algorithms for TC prediction is introduced, aiming to extract the underlying relationships between microstructures and TCs for polymers. We also explore the design of sequence-ordered polymers with high TC using lightweight and mainstream active learning algorithms. Lastly, we conclude by addressing the current limitations and suggesting potential avenues for future research on this topic.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent autocorrelation of a disordered Kuramoto model in the asynchronous state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model has provided deep insights into synchronization phenomena and remains an important paradigm to study the dynamics of coupled oscillators. Yet, despite its success, the asynchronous regime in the Kuramoto model has received limited attention. Here, we adapt and enhance the mean-field approach originally proposed by Stiller and Radons [Phys. Rev. E 58 (1998)] to study the asynchronous state in the Kuramoto model with a finite number of oscillators and with disordered connectivity. By employing an iterative stochastic mean field (IMF) approximation, the complex N-oscillator system can effectively be reduced to a one-dimensional dynamics, both for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. This method allows us to investigate the power spectra of individual oscillators as well as of the multiplicative "network noise" in the Kuramoto model in the asynchronous regime. By taking into account the finite system size and disorder in the connectivity, our findings become relevant for the dynamics of coupled oscillators that appear in the context of biological or technical systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thermal conductivity in 2D silica nanocages of immobilizing noble gas atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noble gas atoms such as Kr and Xe are byproducts of nuclear fission in nuclear plants. How to trap and confine these volatile even radioactive gases is particularly challenging. Recent studies have shown that they can be trapped in nanocages of ultrathin silica. Here, we exhibit with self-consistent phonon theory and four-phonon (4ph) scattering where the adsorption of noble gases results in an anomalous increase in lattice thermal conductivity, while the presence of Cu atoms doping leads to a reduction in lattice thermal conductivity. We trace this behavior in host-guest 2D silica to an interplay of tensile strain, rattling phonon modes, and redistribution of electrons. We also find that 4ph scatterings play indispensable roles in the lattice thermal conductivity of 2D silica. Our work illustrates the microscopic heat transfer mechanism in 2D silica nanocages with the immobilization of noble gas atoms and inspires further exploring materials with the kagome and glasslike lattice thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Illuminating Systematic Trends in Nuclear Data with Generative Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for studying systematic trends in nuclear reaction data using generative adversarial networks. Libraries of nuclear cross section evaluations exhibit intricate systematic trends across the nuclear landscape, and predictive models capable of reproducing and analyzing these trends are valuable for many applications. We have developed a predictive model using deep generative adversarial networks to learn trends from the inelastic neutron scattering channel of TENDL for even-even nuclei. The system predicts cross sections based on adding/subtracting particles to/from the target nucleus. It can thus help identify cross sections that break from expected trends and predict beyond the limit of current experiments. Our model can produce good predictions for cross section curves for many nuclides, and it is most robust near the line of stability. We also create an ensemble of predictions to leverage different correlations and estimate model uncertainty. This research marks an important first step in computer generation of nuclear cross-section libraries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator for accelerating the sampling stage of Monte Carlo simulations. We used the LiteX framework to generate a Petitbateau FemtoRV RISC-V instruction set soft processor and deploy it on a Digilent Arty-100T FPGA development board. The RISC-V soft processor augmented with our programmable random variate accelerator achieves an average speedup of 8.70 times and a median speedup of 8.68 times for a suite of twelve different benchmark applications when compared to GNU Scientific Library software random number generation. These speedups are achievable because the benchmarks spend an average of 90.0 % of their execution time generating random samples. The results of the Monte Carlo benchmark programs run over the programmable random variate accelerator have an average Wasserstein distance of 1.48 times and a median Wasserstein distance of 1.41 times$that of the results produced by the GNU Scientific Library random number generators. The soft processor samples the electron tunneling noise source using the hardened XADC block in the FPGA. The flexibility of the LiteX framework allows for the deployment of any LiteX-supported soft processor with an electron tunneling noise programmable random variate accelerator on any LiteX-supported development board that contains an FPGA with an XADC.</description>

      <title>Vector Ising Spin Annealer for Minimizing Ising Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Vector Ising Spin Annealer (VISA), a framework in gain-based computing that harnesses light-matter interactions to solve complex optimization problems encoded in spin Hamiltonians. Traditional driven-dissipative systems often select excited states due to limitations in spin movement. VISA transcends these constraints by enabling spins to operate in a three-dimensional space, offering a robust solution to minimize Ising Hamiltonians effectively. Our comparative analysis reveals VISA's superior performance over conventional single-dimension spin optimizers, demonstrating its ability to bridge substantial energy barriers in complex landscapes. Through detailed studies on cyclic and random graphs, we show VISA's proficiency in dynamically evolving the energy landscape with time-dependent gain and penalty annealing, illustrating its potential to redefine optimization in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Basis Convolutions for Learning Lagrangian Fluid Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning physical simulations has been an essential and central aspect of many recent research efforts in machine learning, particularly for Navier-Stokes-based fluid mechanics. Classic numerical solvers have traditionally been computationally expensive and challenging to use in inverse problems, whereas Neural solvers aim to address both concerns through machine learning. We propose a general formulation for continuous convolutions using separable basis functions as a superset of existing methods and evaluate a large set of basis functions in the context of (a) a compressible 1D SPH simulation, (b) a weakly compressible 2D SPH simulation, and (c) an incompressible 2D SPH Simulation. We demonstrate that even and odd symmetries included in the basis functions are key aspects of stability and accuracy. Our broad evaluation shows that Fourier-based continuous convolutions outperform all other architectures regarding accuracy and generalization. Finally, using these Fourier-based networks, we show that prior inductive biases, such as window functions, are no longer necessary. An implementation of our approach, as well as complete datasets and solver implementations, is available at https://github.com/tum-pbs/SFBC.</description>

      <title>The effect of inter-track coupling on H$_2$O$_2$ productions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Lower production of H$_2$O$_2$ in water is a hallmark of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) compared to the conventional dose rate (CDR). However, the current computational models based on the predicted yield of H$_2$O$_2$ are in opposite of the experimental data. Methods: We construct an analytical model for the rate equation in the production of H$_2$O$_2$ from \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals and use it as a guide to propose a hypothetical geometrical inhomogeneity in the configuration of particles in the FLASH-UHDR beams. We perform a series of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the track structures for a system of charged particles impinging the medium in the form of clusters and/or bunches. Results: We demonstrate the interplay of diffusion, reaction rates, and overlaps in track-spacing attribute to a lower yield of H$_2$O$_2$ at FLASH-UHDR vs. CDR. This trend is reversed if spacing among the tracks becomes larger than a critical value, with a length scale that is proportional to the diffusion length of \ce{^{.}OH}-radicals modulated by a rate of decay due to recombination with other species, available within a track, and the space among the tracks. The latter is substantial on the suppressing of the H$_2$O$_2$ population at FLASH-UHDR relative to CDR. Conclusions: Based on our analysis of the present work, at FLASH-UHDR, the lower yield in H$_2$O$_2$ can be interpreted as a signature of bunching the particles in beams of ionizing radiation. The beams enter the medium in closely packed clusters and form inhomogeneities in the track-structure distribution. Thus the MC simulations based on the assumption of uniformly distributed tracks are unable to explain the experimental data.</description>

Abstract: For the solution of time-dependent nonlinear differential equations, we present variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) that encode both space and time in qubit registers. The spacetime encoding enables us to obtain the entire time evolution from a single ground-state computation. We describe a general procedure to construct efficient quantum circuits for the cost function evaluation required by VQAs. To mitigate the barren plateau problem during the optimization, we propose an adaptive multigrid strategy. The approach is illustrated for the nonlinear Burgers equation. We classically optimize quantum circuits to represent the desired ground-state solutions, run them on IBM Q System One and Quantinuum System Model H1, and demonstrate that current quantum computers are capable of accurately reproducing the exact results.</description>

Abstract: We propose an enhanced machine learning method to calculate the ground state of two-body systems. Compared to the original method [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)], the present method enables one to consider the spin and isospin degrees of freedom by employing a non-fully-connected deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The validity of this method is verified by calculating the unique bound state of deuteron.</description>

      <title>Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation for High-Resolution, Parsimonious Representations of Multivariate Functions in Physics and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate functions of continuous variables arise in countless branches of science. Numerical computations with such functions typically involve a compromise between two contrary desiderata: accurate resolution of the functional dependence, versus parsimonious memory usage. Recently, two promising strategies have emerged for satisfying both requirements: (i) The quantics representation, which expresses functions as multi-index tensors, with each index representing one bit of a binary encoding of one of the variables; and (ii) tensor cross interpolation (TCI), which, if applicable, yields parsimonious interpolations for multi-index tensors. Here, we present a strategy, quantics TCI (QTCI), which combines the advantages of both schemes. We illustrate its potential with an application from condensed matter physics: the computation of Brillouin zone integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (CXDI) technique offers unique insights into the nanoscale world, enabling the reconstruction of 3D structures with a nanoscale resolution achieved through computational phase reconstruction from measured scattered intensity maps. Computational demands of 3D CXDI, however, limit its real-time application in experimental settings. This work presents a carousel phase retrieval algorithm (CPRA) that enables the real-time, high-resolution reconstruction of computationally complex 3D objects. CPRA is based on representing the 3D reconstruction problem as a set of 2D reconstructions of projected images corresponding to different experimentally collected angles via the Fourier slice theorem. Consistency between the 2D reconstructed images is based on an iterative procedure, in which each 2D reconstruction accounts for the adjacent 2D reconstructed images in a periodic (carousel) manner. Demonstrations on complex systems, including a lithium-rich layered oxide particle and a Staphylococcus aureus biological cell, demonstrate that CPRA significantly enhances the reconstruction quality and enables the reconstruction process to be completed in real time during experiment.</description>

      <title>Probing the Anisotropy and Non-Gaussianity in the Redshift Space through the Conditional Moments of the First Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Focusing on the redshift space observations with plane-parallel approximation and relying on the rotational dependency of the general definition of excursion sets, we introduce the so-called conditional moments of the first derivative ($cmd$) measures for the smoothed matter density field in three dimensions. We derive the perturbative expansion of $cmd$ for the real space and redshift space where peculiar velocity disturbs the galaxies' observed locations. Our criteria can successfully recognize the contribution of linear Kaiser and Finger-of-God effects. Our results demonstrate that the $cmd$ measure has significant sensitivity for pristine constraining the redshift space distortion parameter $\beta=f/b$ and interestingly, the associated normalized quantity in the Gaussian linear Kaiser limit has only $\beta$ dependency. Implementation of the synthetic anisotropic Gaussian field approves the consistency between the theoretical and numerical results. Including the first-order contribution of non-Gaussianity perturbatively in the $cmd$ criterion implies that the N-body simulations for the Quijote suite in the redshift space have been mildly skewed with a higher value for the threshold greater than zero. The non-Gaussianity for the perpendicular direction to the line of sight in the redshift space for smoothing scales $R\gtrsim 20$ Mpc h$^{-1}$ is almost the same as the real space. In contrast, the non-Gaussianity along the line of sight direction in redshift space is magnified. The Fisher forecasts indicate an almost significant enhancement in constraining the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and $n_s$ when using $cmd+cr$ jointly.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of wall-modeled large-eddy simulation for separated turbulent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a parametric analysis to evaluate the sensitivities of wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (LES) with respect to subgrid-scale (SGS) models, mesh resolution, wall boundary conditions and mesh anisotropy. While such investigations have been conducted for attached/flat-plate flow configurations, systematic studies specifically targeting turbulent flows with separation are notably sparse. To bridge this gap, our study focuses on the flow over a two-dimensional Gaussian-shaped bump at a moderately high Reynolds number, which involves smooth-body separation of a turbulent boundary layer under pressure-gradient and surface-curvature effects. In the simulations, the no-slip condition at the wall is replaced by three different forms of boundary condition based on the thin boundary layer equations and the mean wall-shear stress from high-fidelity numerical simulation to avoid the additional complexity of modeling the wall-shear stress. Various statistics, including the mean separation bubble size, mean velocity profile, and dissipation from SGS model, are compared and analyzed. The results reveal that capturing the separation bubble strongly depends on the choice of SGS model. While simulations approach grid convergence with resolutions nearing those of wall-resolved LES meshes, above this limit, the LES predictions exhibit intricate sensitivities to mesh resolution. Furthermore, both wall boundary conditions and the anisotropy of mesh cells exert discernible impacts on the turbulent flow predictions, yet the magnitudes of these impacts vary based on the specific SGS model chosen for the simulation.</description>

      <title>Relativistic beam loading, recoil-reduction, and residual-wake acceleration with a covariant retarded-potential integrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algorithm is demonstrated that performs first-principles tracking of relativistic charged-particles. A covariant approach is used which relies on retarded vector potentials for trajectory integration instead of performing electromagnetic field calculations. When accounting for retardation effects, the peak vector potential and corresponding Lorentz force in the direction of travel increase asymptotically for high-$\beta$ particles. This produces a very strong field distribution at small angles from the particle's direction of travel, which can result in considerable change in momentum when approaching a conducting surface or another charged particle. We quantify the former effect for protons and electrons at various energies and aperture sizes, where substantial power deposition can be avoided by ensuring that particles do not pass within roughly 10 microns of the aperture surface.
  We also simulate breaking a test particle's line of sight with a conductor or other charged body. After this instant, the test particle continues to accelerate due to residual fields, but no longer produces an opposing force on any charged or conducting object; thus any recoil on the enclosing structure is effectively reduced.
  Resulting acceleration dynamics are characterized using protons and electrons at various energies; with, for example, a 1% energy gain for an 85 MeV electron traversing its reflected wake while approaching a pinhole aperture. We then integrate a micro-scale dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) device into our simulations: compared with a solitary 2 mm DLA, we find a factor of two increase in energy gain when combining the DLA with a series of conducting-surface choppers.</description>

      <title>Spectral methods for Neural Integral Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural integral equations are deep learning models based on the theory of integral equations, where the model consists of an integral operator and the corresponding equation (of the second kind) which is learned through an optimization procedure. This approach allows to leverage the nonlocal properties of integral operators in machine learning, but it is computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce a framework for neural integral equations based on spectral methods that allows us to learn an operator in the spectral domain, resulting in a cheaper computational cost, as well as in high interpolation accuracy. We study the properties of our methods and show various theoretical guarantees regarding the approximation capabilities of the model, and convergence to solutions of the numerical methods. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the resulting model.</description>

      <title>The geodesic dispersion phenomenon in random fields dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct consequence of geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of their parametric space.</description>

      <title>How Physics Students Develop Disciplinary Computational Literacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computation has revolutionized science and is gradually making its way into science teaching and learning. However, we currently lack theoretical frameworks to make sense of how students learn to use computation as a disciplinary tool. In this study, we propose disciplinary computational literacy as a productive theoretical lens on this subject. This theoretical perspective views computation as a new type of literacy consisting of material, cognitive, and social elements. We argue that these elements will necessarily vary by discipline and use case studies of two pairs of students writing computational essays in an intermediate physics course to examine how disciplinary computational literacy looks and is built at an undergraduate level. Through these case studies we see the pairs leveraging the different elements of their computational literacy to both engage with and produce computational literature in their discipline, while also engaging in a process of epistemic negotiation between their interests, the course goals, available tools, and their basis of computational literacy. These cases show how computational literacy can highlight the ways in which scientific computing helps students build disciplinary understanding and also shows that computational essays, as a genre of computational literature, are a useful epistemic form for developing computational literacy.</description>
