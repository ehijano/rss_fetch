      <title>Complete Minimal Surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with Three Embedded Planar Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complete minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with three embedded planar ends parallel to those of the union of the Lagrangian catenoid and the plane passing through its waist circle. We show that any complete, oriented, immersed minimal surface in $\mathbb{R}^4$ of finite total curvature with genus $1$ and three such ends must be $J$-holomorphic for some almost complex structure $J$. Under the additional assumptions of embeddedness and at least $8$ symmetries, we prove that the number of symmetries must be either $8$ or $12$, and in each case, the surface is uniquely determined up to rigid motions and scalings. Furthermore, we establish a nonexistence result for genus $g\geq2$ when the surface is embedded and has at least $4(g+1)$ symmetries. Our approach is based on a modification of the method of Costa and Hoffman-Meeks in the setting of $\mathbb{R}^4$, utilizing the generalized Weierstrass representation.</description>

      <title>Chern's Conjecture in the Dupin case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern's conjecture states that a closed minimal hypersurface in the euclidean sphere is isoparametric if it has constant scalar curvature. When the number $g$ of distinct principal curvatures is greater than three, few satisfactory results have been known. We attack the conjecture in the Dupin hypersurface case. Our results are: A closed proper Dupin hypersurface with constant mean curvature is isoparametric (i) if $g=3$,
  (ii) if $g=4$ and has constant scalar curvature, or (iii) if $g=4$ and has constant Lie curvature, and
  (iv) if $g=6$ and has constant Lie curvatures. These cover all the non-trivial cases for a closed proper Dupin to be isoparametric since $g$ can take only values $1,2,3,4,6$. The originality of the proof is a use of topology and geometry,
  which reduces assumptions needed in the algebraic argument.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the normal injectivity radius of hypersurfaces and bounded geometries on manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove for the first time a pointwise lower estimate of the normal injectivity radius of an embedded hypersurface in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold. Main applications include: (i) a pointwise lower estimate of the graphing radius of a properly embedded hypersurface; (ii) the construction of metrics of bounded geometry on arbitrary manifolds with boundary; (iii) the equivalence of the classical (topological) notion of orientation with that of the geometric notion (in the sense of metric measure spaces) on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds with boundary. In addition, we prove that every manifold with boundary admits a metric with bounded geometry such that the boundary becomes convex. This result strengthens the justification of a recent notion of orientation on finite dimensional RCD spaces.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ricci flow and long-time existence of Harmonic map heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an ancient Ricci flow asymptotic to a compact integrable shrinker, or a Ricci flow developing a finite-time singularity modelled on the shrinker, we establish the long-time existence of a harmonic map heat flow between the Ricci flow and the shrinker for all times. This provides a global parabolic gauge for the Ricci flow and implies the uniqueness of the tangent flow without modulo any diffeomorphisms.
  We present two main applications: First, we construct and classify all ancient Ricci flows asymptotic to any compact integrable shrinker, showing that they converge exponentially. Second, we obtain the optimal convergence rate at singularities modelled on the shrinker, characterized by the first negative eigenvalue of the stability operator for the entropy. In particular, we show that any Ricci flow developing a round $\mathbb S^n$ singularity converges at least at the rate $(-t)^{\frac{n+1}{n-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral asymmetry via pseudodifferential projections: the massless Dirac operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry for systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on closed manifolds was proposed in a recent series of papers by the first author and collaborator. They showed that information on spectral asymmetry can be encoded within and recovered from a negative order pseudodifferential operator -- the asymmetry operator -- constructed from appropriately defined pseudodifferential (spectral) projections. In this manuscript we apply these techniques to the study of the massless Dirac operator; in particular, we compute the principal symbol of the asymmetry operator, accounting for the underlying gauge invariance.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of the Symmetry Group of $L_p$-Minkowski Problem on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Convex Geometry, a core topic is the $L_p$-Minkowski problem
  \begin{equation}\label{e0.1}
  \det(\nabla^2h+hI)=fh^{p-1}, \ \ \forall X\in{\mathbb{S}}^n, \ \ \forall p\in \mathbb{R}
  \end{equation} of Monge-Amp\`{e}re type. By the transformation $u(x)=h(X)\sqrt{1+|x|^2}$ and semi-spherical projection, equation \eqref{e0.1} can be reformulated by the Monge-Amp\`{e}re type equation
  \begin{equation}\label{e0.2}
  \det D^2u=(1+|x|^2)^{-\frac{p+n+1}{2}}u^{p-1}, \ \ \forall x\in{\mathbb{R}}^n, \ \ \forall p\in \mathbb{R}
  \end{equation} on the Euclidean space. In this paper, we will firstly determine the symmetric groups of $n$-dimensional fully nonlinear equation \eqref{e0.2} without asymptotic growth assumption. After proving several key resolution lemmas, we thus completely classify the symmetric groups of the $L_p$-Minkowski problem. Our method develops the Lie theory to fully nonlinear PDEs in Convex Geometry.</description>

      <title>Loop group methods for the non-abelian Hodge correspondence on a 4-punctured sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.12106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-abelian Hodge correspondence is a real analytic map between the moduli space of stable Higgs bundles and the deRham moduli space of irreducible flat connections mediated by solutions to the self-duality equations. In this paper we construct self-duality solutions for strongly parabolic $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb C)$ Higgs fields on a $4$-punctured sphere with parabolic weights $t \sim 0$ using complex analytic methods. We identify the rescaled limit hyper-K\"ahler moduli space $\mathcal M_t$ at $t=0$ to be the completion of the nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb C)$ modulo a $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$ action, equipped with the Eguchi-Hanson metric. Our methods and computations are based on the twistor approach to the self-duality equations using Deligne and Simpson's $\lambda$-connections interpretation. By construction we can compute the Taylor expansions of the holomorphic symplectic form $\varpi_t$ on $\mathcal M_t$ at $t=0$ which turn out to have closed form expressions in terms of multiple polylogarithms (MPLs). The geometric properties of $\mathcal M_t$ lead to some identities of certain MPLs which we believe deserve further investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the homogeneous manifold $\mathbb{E}(-1,\tau),$ for $-\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;H&lt;\tfrac{1}{2},$ {we define a new product compactification in which the slices $\left\{t=c\right\}_{c\in\R}$ are rotational $H$-surfaces. This product compatification is the natural setting where it makes sense to study the asymptotic Dirichlet Problem for the constant mean curvature equation. Indeed, for every rectifiable curve $\Gamma$ projecting bijectively onto $\partial\H^2$ we prove the existence of a unique entire $H$-graph that is asymptotic to $\Gamma$.} We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $H$-graphs over unbounded domains having prescribed, possibly infinite boundary data.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving nonhomogeneous Gauss curvature flow in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the volume preserving flow of smooth, closed and convex hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$ with speed given by a general nonhomogeneous function of the Gauss curvature. For a large class of speed functions, we prove that the solution of the flow remains convex, exists for all positive time $t\in [0,\infty)$ and converges to a geodesic sphere exponentially as $t\to\infty$ in the smooth topology. A key step is to show the $L^1$ oscillation decay of the Gauss curvature to its average along a subsequence of times going to the infinity, which combined with an argument using the hyperbolic curvature measure theory implies the Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>On a natural L2 metric on the space of Hermitian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the space of Hermitian metrics on a fixed complex vector bundle. This infinite-dimensional space has appeared in the study of Hermitian-Einstein structures, where a special L2-type Riemannian metric is introduced. We compute the metric spray, geodesics and curvature associated to this metric, and show that the exponential map is a diffeomorphsim. Though being geodesically complete, the space of Hermitian metrics is metrically incomplete, and its metric completion is proved to be the space of L2 integrable singular Hermitian metrics. In addition, both the original space and its completion are CAT(0). In the holomorphic case, it turns out that Griffiths seminegative/semipositive singular Hermitian metric is always L2 integrable in our sense. Also, in the Appendix, the Nash-Moser inverse function theorem is used to prove that, for any L2 metric on the space of smooth sections of a given fiber bundle, the exponential map is always a local diffeomorphism, provided that each fiber is nonpositively curved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.16367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the possible ways of gluing twisted products of circles with asymptotically cylindrical Calabi-Yau manifolds to produce manifolds with holonomy G_2, thus generalising the twisted connected sum construction of Kovalev and Corti, Haskins, Nordstr\"om, Pacini. We then express the extended nu-invariant of Crowley, Goette, and Nordstr\"om arXiv:1505.02734 in terms of fixpoint and gluing contributions, which include different types of (generalised) Dedekind sums. Surprisingly, the calculations involve some non-trivial number-theoretical arguments connected with special values of the Dedekind eta-function and the theory of complex multiplication. One consequence of our computations is that there exist compact G_2-manifolds that are not G_2-nullbordant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an area-minimizing integral current of dimension $m$ and codimension at least $2$ and fix an arbitrary interior singular point $q$ where at least one tangent cone is flat. For any vanishing sequence of scales around $q$ along which the rescaled currents converge to a flat cone, we define a suitable singularity degree of the rescalings, which is a real number bigger than or equal to $1$. We show that this number is independent of the chosen sequence and we prove several interesting properties linked to its value. Our study prepares the ground for two companion works, where we show that the singular set is $(m-2)$-rectifiable and the tangent cone is unique at $\mathcal{H}^{m-2}$-a.e. point.</description>

Abstract: We prove that many relatively hyperbolic groups obtained by relative strict hyperbolization admit a cocompact action on a CAT(0) cubical complex. Under suitable assumptions on the peripheral subgroups, these groups are residually finite and even virtually special. We include some applications to the theory of manifolds, such as the construction of new non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds with residually finite fundamental group, and the existence of non-triangulable aspherical manifolds with virtually special fundamental group.</description>
