      <description>arXiv:2408.14485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theory, two extreme forms of substances exist:the pure form and the single-molecule mixture form. The latter contains a mixture of molecules with molecularly different structures.Inspired by the "chemical space"concept, I recently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state that combines model construction and mathematical analysis,obtaining some interesting results.(Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024,25,7571.) In this preprint,a detailed discussion of the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>

      <title>Some challenges of diffused interfaces in implicit-solvent models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard Poisson-Boltzmann model for molecular electrostatics assumes a sharp variation of the permittivity and salt concentration along the solute-solvent interface. The discontinuous field parameters are not only difficult numerically, but also are not a realistic physical picture, as it forces the dielectric constant and ionic strength of bulk in the near-solute region. An alternative to alleviate some of these issues is to represent the molecular surface as a diffuse interface, however, this also presents challenges. In this work we analysed the impact of the shape of the interfacial variation of the field parameters in solvation and binding energy. However we used a hyperbolic tangent function ($\tanh(k_p x)$) to couple the internal and external regions, our analysis is valid for other definitions. Our methodology was based on a coupled finite element (FEM) and boundary element (BEM) scheme that allowed us to have a special treatment of the permittivity and ionic strength in a bounded FEM region near the interface, while maintaining BEM elsewhere. Our results suggest that the shape of the function (represented by $k_p$) has a large impact on solvation and binding energy. We saw that high values of $k_p$ induce a high gradient on the interface, to the limit of recovering the sharp jump when $k_p\to\infty$, presenting a numerical challenge where careful meshing is key. Using the FreeSolv database to compare with molecular dynamics, our calculations indicate that an optimal value of $k_p$ for solvation energies was around 3. However, more challenging binding free energy tests make this conclusion more difficult, as binding showed to be very sensitive to small variations of $k_p$. In that case, optimal values of $k_p$ ranged from 2 to 20.</description>

      <title>Theory of Molecular Emission Power Spectra. III. Multichromophoric Systems Coupled with Polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on our previous study [S. Wang $\textit{et al}$. J. Chem. Phys. $\textbf{153}$, 184102 (2020)], we generalize the theory of molecular emission power spectra from single molecules to multichromophoric systems in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. This generalized theory is applicable to ensembles of molecules in arbitrary inhomogeneous, dispersive, and absorbing media. In the far-field region, the emission power spectra can be decomposed into products of \textit{electromagnetic environment factors} and \textit{lineshape functions}. To demonstrate the polaritonic effect on multichromophoric systems, we numerically simulate the emission power spectra of one to three molecules above a silver surface. The peak position redshifts as the number of the molecules increases, consistent with Kasha's model. However, surprisingly, the peak height does not increase with the number of molecules. To understand this unusual phenomenon, we derive analytical expressions for lineshape functions and find that the peak heights are associated to the imaginary part of dipole-dipole interactions, which stem from the absorption of the silver surface. It is worth noting that our theory not only covers the key results derived from Kasha's model, but also can predict the lineshape functions of molecules in complex dielectric environments. This study offers one alternative approach to directly analyze the hybrid-state dynamics of multichromophoric systems coupled with polariton.</description>

      <title>Near Equivalence of Polarizability and Bond Order Flux Metrics for Describing Covalent Bond Rearrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of the breaking point for the chemical bond is essential for our understanding of chemical reactivity. The current consensus is that a point of maximal electron delocalization along the bonding axis separates the different bonding regimes of reactants and products. This maximum transition point has been investigated previously through the total position spread and the bond-parallel components of the static polarizability tensor for describing covalent bond breaking. In this paper, we report that the first-order change of the Wiberg and Mayer bond index with respect to the reaction coordinate, the bond flux, is similarly maximized and is nearly equivalent with the bond breaking points determined by the bond-parallel polarizability. We investigate the similarites and differences between the two bonding metrics for breaking the nitrogen triple bond, twisting around the ethene double bond, and a set of prototypical reactions in the hydrogen combustion reaction network. The Wiberg-Mayer bond flux provides a simpler approach to calculating the point of bond dissociation and formation and can yield greater chemical insight through bond specific information for certain reactions where multiple bond changes are operative.</description>

      <title>Interplay of protection and damage through intermolecular processes in the decay of electronic core holes in microsolvated organic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft X-ray irradiation of molecules causes electronic core-level vacancies through photoelectronemission. In light elements, such as C, N, or O, which are abundant in the biosphere, these vacancies predominantly decay by Auger emission, leading inevitably to dissociative multiply charged states. It was recently demonstrated that an environment can prevent fragmentation of core-level-ionized small organic molecules through immediate non-local decay of the core hole, dissipating charge and energy to the environment. Here, we present an extended photoelectron-photoion-photoion coincidence (PEPIPICO) study of the biorelevant pyrimidine molecule embedded in a water cluster. It is observed and supported by theoretical calculations that the supposed protective effect of the environment is partially reversed if the vacancy is originally located at a water molecule. In this scenario, intermolecular energy or charge transfer from the core-ionized water environment to the pyrimidine molecule leads to ionization of the latter, however, presumably in non-dissociative cationic states. Our results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay of protective and harmful effects of an environment in the photochemistry of microsolvated molecules exposed to X-rays.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Approach to Learning Optimal Forms of Constitutive Relations in Models Describing Lithium Plating in Battery Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we construct a data-driven model describing Lithium plating in a battery cell, which is a key process contributing to degradation of such cells. Starting from the fundamental Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, we use asymptotic reduction and spatial averaging techniques to derive a simplified representation to track the temporal evolution of two key concentrations in the system, namely, the total intercalated Lithium on the negative electrode particles and total plated Lithium. This model depends on an a priori unknown constitutive relations of the cell as a function of thestate variables. An optimal form of this constitutive relation is then deduced from experimental measurements of the time dependent concentrations of different Lithium phases acquired through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. This is done by solving an inverse problem in which this constitutive relation is found subject to minimum assumptions as a minimizer of a suitable constrained optimization problem where the discrepancy between the model predictions and experimental data is minimized. This optimization problem is solved using a state-of-the-art adjoint-based technique. In contrast to some of the earlier approaches to modelling Lithium plating, the proposed model is able to predict non-trivial evolution of the concentrations in the relaxation regime when no current isapplied to the cell. When equipped with an optimal constitutive relation, the model provides accurate predictions of the time evolution of both intercalated and plated Lithium across a wide range of charging/discharging rates. It can therefore serve as a useful tool for prediction and control of degradation mechanism in battery cells.</description>

      <title>Fully Polarizable Multiconfigurational Self-consistent Field/Fluctuating Charge Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiscale model based on the coupling of the multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) method and the classical atomistic polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) force field is presented. The resulting MCSCF/FQ approach is validated by exploiting the CASSCF scheme through application to compute vertical excitation energies of formaldehyde and para-nitroaniline in aqueous solution. The procedure is integrated with molecular dynamics simulations to capture the solute's conformational changes and the dynamic aspects of solvation. Comparative analysis with alternative solvent models, gas-phase calculations, and experimental data provides insights into the model's accuracy in reproducing solute-solvent molecular interactions and spectral signals.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures containing a very strongly polar compound. 11. 1-Alkanol + alkanenitrile systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1-Alkanol + alkanenitrile systems have been studied by means of the DISQUAC, ERAS and UNIFAC (Dortmund) models. DISQUAC and ERAS parameters for the alkanol/nitrile interactions are reported. DISQUAC describes a whole set of thermodynamic properties: phase equilibria, vapour-liquid (VLE), liquid-liquid (LLE) and solid-liquid (SLE) equilibria, molar excess functions, Gibbs energies, $G_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and enthalpies, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, and partial excess molar enthalpies at infinite dilution, $H_{\text{mi}}^{\text{E,}\infty }$ using the same set of interaction parameters for each solution. The dependence on the molecular structure of the interaction parameters is similar to that observed in other previous applications to mixtures formed by 1-alkanols and a strongly polar compound, in such way that the quasichemical interchange coefficients can be kept constant from 1-propanol. However, methanol and ethanol solutions behave differently. From the analysis of experimental data for $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, $TS_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}(=H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}-G_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}})$, and molar excess volumes, $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$, it is concluded that the studied systems are characterized by dipolar interactions and strong structural effects. The former are more relevant in acetonitrile solutions. Association effects are more important in butanenitrile mixtures. DISQUAC improves $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ results from the ERAS model. ERAS results on $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ for systems containing acetonitrile are also improved by UNIFAC. This remarks the importance of dipolar interactions in the investigated mixtures. ERAS describes the variation of $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$(${{x}_{1}}$=0.5) with the 1-alkanol size for mixtures with a given nitrile, but the concentration dependence of this excess function is poorly represented.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear phase-field model of corrosion with charging kinetics of electric double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonlinear phase-field model is developed to simulate corrosion damage. The motion of the electrode$-$ electrolyte interface follows the usual kinetic rate theory for chemical reactions based on the Butler-Volmer equation. The model links the surface polarization variation associated with the charging kinetics of an electric double layer (EDL) to the mesoscale transport. The effects of the EDL are integrated as a boundary condition on the solution potential equation. The boundary condition controls the magnitude of the solution potential at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The ion concentration field outside the EDL is obtained by solving the electro-diffusion equation and Ohm's law for the solution potential. The model is validated against the classic benchmark pencil electrode test. The framework developed reproduces experimental measurements of both pit kinetics and transient current density response. The model enables more accurate information on corrosion damage, current density, and environmental response in terms of the distribution of electric potential and charged species. The sensitivity analysis for different properties of the EDL is performed to investigate their role in the electrochemical response of the system. Simulation results show that the properties of the EDL significantly influence the transport of ionic species in the electrolyte.</description>

      <title>Understanding kinetic interactions between NOx and C2-C5 alkanes and alkenes: The rate rules and influences of H-atom abstractions by NO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to reveal the important role and the respective rate rules of H atom abstractions by NO2 for better understanding NOX hydrocarbon interactions. To this end, H atom abstractions from C2 to C5 alkanes and alkenes 15 species by NO2, leading to the formation of three HNO2 isomers (TRANS HONO, HNO2, and CIS HONO) and their respective products 45 reactions, are first characterized through high-level quantum chemistry computation, where electronic structures, single point energies, C H bond dissociation energies and 1 D hindered rotor potentials are determined at DLPNO CCSD T cc pVDZ M06 2X 6 311 plus plus g(d,p). The rate coefficients for all studied reactions, over a temperature range from 298.15 to 2000 K, are computed using Transition State Theory with the Master Equation System Solver program. Comprehensive analysis of branching ratios elucidates the diversity and similarities between different species, HNO2 isomers, and abstraction site, from which accurate rate rules are determined. Incorporating the updated rate parameters into a detailed chemical kinetic model reveals the significant influences of this type of reaction on model prediction results, where the simulated ignition delay times are either prolonged or reduced, depending on the original rate parameters presented in the selected model. Sensitivity and flux analysis further highlight the critical role of this type of reaction in affecting system reactivity and reaction pathways, emphasizing the need for adequately representing these kinetics in existing chemistry models. This can now be sufficiently achieved for alkanes and alkenes through the results from this study.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{P,T}$-odd effects in YbCu, YbAg and YbAu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the molecular enhancement factors of the $\mathcal{P,T}$-odd interactions involving the electron electric dipole moment ($W_\mathrm{d}$) and the scalar-pseudoscalar nucleon-electron couplings ($W_\mathrm{s}$) are computed for the ground state of the bimetallic molecules YbCu, YbAg and YbAu. These systems offer a promising venue for creating cold molecules by associating laser cooled atoms. The relativistic coupled-cluster approach is used in the calculations and a thorough uncertainty analysis is performed to give accurate and reliable uncertainties to the obtained values. Furthermore, an in-depth investigation of the different electronic structure effects that determine the magnitude of the calculated enhancement factors is carried out, and two different schemes for computing $W_\mathrm{d}$ are compared. The recommended values for the enhancement factors are $(13.24\pm0.03)\times10^{24}\frac{h\,\text{Hz}}{e\,\text{cm}}$, $(12.15\pm0.08)\times10^{24}\frac{h\,\text{Hz}}{e\,\text{cm}}$ and $(2.13\pm0.28)\times10^{24}\frac{h\,\text{Hz}}{e\,\text{cm}}$ for $W_\mathrm{d}$, and $(-48.36\pm0.18)\;h\,\text{kHz}$, $(-45.51\pm0.43)\;h\,\text{kHz}$ and $(5.31\pm1.80)\;h\,\text{kHz}$ for $W_\mathrm{s}$, for YbCu, YbAg and YbAu, respectively.</description>

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Jones-Wilkins-Lee (JWL) equation of state (EOS) is the most popular equation of state used in hydrocodes to model detonation products thermodynamics resulting from high explosives. However, the JWL EOS presents several major difficulties. Namely, its range of validity and convexity is limited as its parameters are adjusted on a given reference curve. When used in conditions where the thermodynamic state varies significantly, computational failure may happen. It occurs frequently in multiphase flow computations when heat and mass transfers with other phases are present, as the resulting thermodynamic state is far from the reference curve used for adjustment. Moreover, the detonation products composition is absent in the JWL formulation. This is another important limitation when additional physics are involved, such as post-combustion, phase transition, or when dealing with non-ideal explosives. In this work, the Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) EOS is considered instead. The BKW EOS is widely used in thermochemical codes, as parent EOS to provide the reference data used to fit JWL EOS parameters. The BKW EOS present several advantages. Its formulation considers variable gas species in the detonation products. No specific adjustment is needed for a given explosive, and only the detonation products composition requires computational efforts. Its range of validity is large, as the various parameters have been adjusted for each gas species separately. However, the BKW EOS also present difficulties which limit its application in hydrocodes. These difficulties are the aim of the present work. The BKW EOS is currently restricted to thermochemical codes as its mathematical formulation is computationally expensive. It also requires the gas chemical composition to be computed via an appropriate chemical equilibrium solver. In the present work, the computational cost of the BKW EOS is reduced thanks to the thermodynamic relaxation method of Neron et al. (2023). The variable composition of the detonation products is accounted for through specific relaxation terms computed once, with the help of conventional thermochemical codes. The condensed species, such as solid carbon, are modelled with the Cochran-Chan (CC) EOS, having a simpler thermodynamic formulation and being thermodynamically consistent compared to usual EOSs used for condensed species. This multiphase formulation made of BKW gas mixture with variable composition and condensed phases is considered in temperature and pressure equilibrium. It is embedded in a multiphase flow formulation, with the help of the thermodynamic relaxation method mentioned above. It shows comparable computational cost as the JWL formulation, with significantly enhanced physics capabilities and improved robustness.</description>

      <title>Ionization potential of radium monofluoride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionization potential (IP) of radium monofluoride (RaF) was measured to be 4.972(2)[14] eV, revealing a relativistic enhancement in the series of alkaline earth monofluorides. The results are in agreement with a relativistic coupled-cluster prediction of 4.978[6] eV, incorporating up to quantum electrodynamics corrections. Using the same computational methodology, an improved calculation for the dissociation energy ($D_{e}$) of 5.56[5] eV is presented. This confirms that radium monofluoride joins the small group of diatomic molecules for which $D_{e}&gt;\mathrm{IP}$, paving the way for precision control and interrogation of its Rydberg states.</description>

      <title>Molecular Entanglement Witness by Absorption Spectroscopy in Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Producing and maintaining molecular entanglement at room temperature and detecting multipartite entanglement features of macroscopic molecular systems remain key challenges for understanding inter-molecular quantum effects in chemistry. Here, we study the quantum Fisher information, a central concept in quantum metrology, as a multipartite entanglement witness. We generalize the entanglement witness functional related to quantum Fisher information regarding non-identical local response operators. We show that it is a good inter-molecular entanglement witness for ultrastrong light-matter coupling in cavity quantum electrodynamics, including near the superradiant phase transition. We further connect quantum Fisher information to the dipole correlator, which suggests that this entanglement could be detected by absorption spectroscopy. Our work proposes a general protocol to detect inter-molecular entanglement in chemical systems at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic couplings as a stabilization mechanism in long-range Rydberg molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range Rydberg molecules are typically bound in wells formed in their oscillatory potential energy curves. In alkaline Rydberg molecules, bound vibrational states exist even when these potential wells are disrupted by level repulsion from the steep butterfly potential energy curve induced by a scattering shape resonance. The binding in this case is attributed to quantum reflection. However, the rapidly varying regions of the potential energy landscape where quantum reflection occurs often coincide with regions where non-adiabatic coupling becomes significant. By comparing the molecular states calculated within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where quantum reflection is the only binding mechanism, with those obtained from the full set of coupled channel equations, we can assess the effects of non-adiabatic coupling on vibrational energies and lifetimes. Our findings show that these couplings can stabilize the molecule by providing an additional barrier which protects the vibrational states from predissociation and non-radiative transitions. There can also be extreme cases where non-adiabatic coupling completely dominates the binding and the molecular lifetimes saturate at the atomic Rydberg lifetime.</description>

      <title>Controlling few-body reaction pathways using a Feshbach resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaining control over chemical reactions on the quantum level is a central goal of the modern field of cold and ultracold chemistry. Here, we demonstrate a novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination process across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a magnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a specific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the control of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used to significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that while the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body recombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains unchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction processes. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control schemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.</description>

      <title>Universal Negative Energetic Elasticity in Polymer Chains: Crossovers among Random, Self-Avoiding, and Neighbor-Avoiding Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Negative energetic elasticity in gels challenges the conventional understanding of gel elasticity, and despite extensive research, a concise explanation remains elusive. In this Letter, we use the weakly self-avoiding walk (the Domb-Joyce model; DJ model) and interacting self-avoiding walk (ISAW) to investigate its emergence in polymer chains. Using exact enumeration, we show that both the DJ model and ISAW exhibit negative energetic elasticity, which is caused by effective soft-repulsive interactions between polymer segments. Moreover, we find that a universal scaling law for the internal energy of both models, with a common exponent of $7/4$, holds consistently across both random-walk-self-avoiding-walk and self-avoiding-walk-neighbor-avoiding-walk crossovers. These findings suggest that negative energetic elasticity is a fundamental and universal property of polymer networks and chains.</description>

      <title>Latent Ewald summation for machine learning of long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) often neglect long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dispersion forces. In this work, we introduce a straightforward and efficient method to account for long-range interactions by learning a latent variable from local atomic descriptors and applying an Ewald summation to this variable. We demonstrate that in systems including charged, polar, or apolar molecular dimers, bulk water, and water-vapor interface, standard short-ranged MLIPs can lead to unphysical predictions even when employing message passing. The long-range models effectively eliminate these artifacts, with only about twice the computational cost of short-range MLIPs.</description>

      <title>Binding Selectivity Analysis from Alchemical Receptor Hopping and Swapping Free Energy Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present receptor hopping and receptor swapping free energy estimation protocols based on the Alchemical Transfer Method (ATM) to model the binding selectivity of a set of ligands to two arbitrary receptors. The receptor hopping protocol, where a ligand is alchemically transferred from one receptor to another in one simulation, directly yields the ligand's binding selectivity free energy for the two receptors, which is the difference between the two individual binding free energies. In the receptor swapping protocol, the first ligand of a pair is transferred from one receptor to another while the second ligand is simultaneously transferred in the opposite direction. The receptor swapping free energy yields the differences in binding selectivity free energies of a set of ligands, which, when combined using a generalized DiffNet algorithm, yield the binding selectivity free energies of the ligands. We test these algorithms on host-guest systems and show that they yield results that agree with experimental data and are consistent with differences in absolute and relative binding free energies obtained by conventional methods. Preliminary applications to the selectivity analysis of molecular fragments binding to the trypsin and thrombin serine protease confirm the potential of the receptor swapping technology in structure-based drug discovery. The novel methodologies presented in this work are a first step toward streamlined and computationally efficient protocols for ligand selectivity optimization across protein receptors with potentially low sequence identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Markov jump processes on a graph described by a rate matrix that depends on various control parameters. We derive explicit expressions for the static responses of edge currents and steady-state probabilities. We show that they are constrained by the graph topology (i.e. the incidence matrix) by deriving response relations (i.e. linear constraints linking the different responses) and topology-dependent bounds. For unicyclic networks, all scaled current responses are between zero and one and must sum to one. Applying these results to stochastic thermodynamics, we derive explicit expressions for the static response of fundamental currents (which carry the full dissipation) to fundamental thermodynamic forces (which drive the system away from equilibrium).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the complete set of transition frequencies necessary to laser cool and trap MgF molecules. Specifically, we report the frequency of multiple low $J$ transitions of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=0,1) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=0)$, $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2) \rightarrow A^2\Pi_{1/2}(v^\prime=1)$, and $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1) \rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime}=0)$ bands of MgF. The measured $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1)\rightarrow B^2\Sigma^+(v^\prime=0)$ spectrum allowed the spin-rotation and hyperfine parameters of the $B^2\Sigma^+(v=0)$ state of MgF to be determined. Furthermore, we demonstrate optical cycling in MgF by pumping molecules into the $X^2\Sigma^+(v=1,2)$ states. Optical pumping enhances the spectroscopic signals of transitions originating in the $N^{\prime\prime}=1$ level of the $X^2\Sigma^+(v^{\prime\prime}=1,2)$ states.</description>

      <title>Detection of antifreeze molecule ethylene glycol in the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of complex prebiotic molecules using millimeter and submillimeter telescopes allows us to understand how the basic building blocks of life are formed in the universe. In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is the reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde (CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission lines of $aGg^{\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is (4.5$\pm$0.1)$\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of 155$\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH are 3.1$\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated abundance of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase warm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the observed abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the possible formation pathways of $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the hot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is probably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain surface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.</description>
