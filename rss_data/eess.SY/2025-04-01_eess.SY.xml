      <title>A Multiple Artificial Potential Functions Approach for Collision Avoidance in UAV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collision avoidance is a problem largely studied in robotics, particularly in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) applications. Among the main challenges in this area are hardware limitations, the need for rapid response, and the uncertainty associated with obstacle detection. Artificial potential functions (APOFs) are a prominent method to address these challenges. However, existing solutions lack assurances regarding closed-loop stability and may result in chattering effects. Motivated by this, we propose a control method for static obstacle avoidance based on multiple artificial potential functions (MAPOFs). We derive tuning conditions on the control parameters that ensure the stability of the final position. The stability proof is established by analyzing the closed-loop system using tools from hybrid systems theory. Furthermore, we validate the performance of the MAPOF control through simulations, showcasing its effectiveness in avoiding static obstacles.</description>

      <title>A Cooperative Compliance Control Framework for Socially Optimal Mixed Traffic Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mixed traffic environments, where Connected and Autonomed Vehicles (CAVs) coexist with potentially non-cooperative Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), the self-centered behavior of human drivers may compromise the efficiency, optimality, and safety of the overall traffic network. In this paper, we propose a Cooperative Compliance Control (CCC) framework for mixed traffic routing, where a Social Planner (SP) optimizes vehicle routes for system-wide optimality while a compliance controller incentivizes human drivers to align their behavior with route guidance from the SP through a "refundable toll" scheme. A key challenge arises from the heterogeneous and unknown response models of different human driver types to these tolls, making it difficult to design a proper controller and achieve desired compliance probabilities over the traffic network. To address this challenge, we employ Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to adaptively correct (learn) crucial components of our compliance probability model online, construct data-driven feedback controllers, and demonstrate that we can achieve the desired compliance probability for HDVs, thereby contributing to the social optimality of the traffic network.</description>

      <title>Passivity, No-Regret, and Convergent Learning in Contractive Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between passivity, no-regret, and convergence in contractive games for various learning dynamic models and their higher-order variants. Our setting is continuous time. Building on prior work for replicator dynamics, we show that if learning dynamics satisfy a passivity condition between the payoff vector and the difference between its evolving strategy and any fixed strategy, then it achieves finite regret. We then establish that the passivity condition holds for various learning dynamics and their higher-order variants. Consequentially, the higher-order variants can achieve convergence to Nash equilibrium in cases where their standard order counterparts cannot, while maintaining a finite regret property. We provide numerical examples to illustrate the lack of finite regret of different evolutionary dynamic models that violate the passivity property. We also examine the fragility of the finite regret property in the case of perturbed learning dynamics. Continuing with passivity, we establish another connection between finite regret and passivity, but with the related equilibrium-independent passivity property. Finally, we present a passivity-based classification of dynamic models according to the various passivity notions they satisfy, namely, incremental passivity, $\delta$-passivity, and equilibrium-independent passivity. This passivity-based classification provides a framework to analyze the convergence of learning dynamic models in contractive games.</description>

      <title>Sensorless Field Oriented Control of CSI-Fed PMSM Drives Used in Submersible Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a practical startup strategy for current source inverter (CSI)-fed Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) drives in submersible pump applications, focusing on ensuring a seamless shift to sensorless field-oriented control (FOC). The method effectively manages the transition to sensorless operation without requiring precise current or alignment error calculations, thereby simplifying implementation. By addressing speed and current oscillations directly during the startup and transition stages, the approach significantly enhances overall system stability and responsiveness. Validation through simulation and experimental testing demonstrates the strategy's success in maintaining low oscillation levels across various operating conditions, confirming its reliability for high-performance industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Markov Potential Game Construction and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov games (MGs) serve as the mathematical foundation for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), enabling self-interested agents to learn their optimal policies while interacting with others in a shared environment. However, due to the complexities of an MG problem, seeking (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium (NE) is often very challenging for a general-sum MG. Markov potential games (MPGs), which are a special class of MGs, have appealing properties such as guaranteed existence of pure NEs and guaranteed convergence of gradient play algorithms, thereby leading to desirable properties for many MARL algorithms in their NE-seeking processes. However, the question of how to construct MPGs has been open. This paper provides sufficient conditions on the reward design and on the Markov decision process (MDP), under which an MG is an MPG. Numerical results on autonomous driving applications are reported.</description>

      <title>Attitude Synchronization for Multi-Agent Systems on SO(3) Using Vector Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of leaderless attitude synchronization for a group of rigid body systems evolving on SO(3), relying on local measurements of some inertial (unit-length) vectors. The interaction graph among agents is assumed to be undirected, acyclic, and connected. We first present a distributed attitude synchronization scheme designed at the kinematic level of SO(3), followed by an extended scheme designed at the dynamic level. Both schemes are supported by a rigorous stability analysis, which establishes their almost global asymptotic stability properties. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of both distributed attitude synchronization schemes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Remote Driver Performance in Urban Environment Operational Design Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote driving has emerged as a solution for enabling human intervention in scenarios where Automated Driving Systems (ADS) face challenges, particularly in urban Operational Design Domains (ODDs). This study evaluates the performance of Remote Drivers (RDs) of passenger cars in a representative urban ODD in Las Vegas, focusing on the influence of cumulative driving experience and targeted training approaches. Using performance metrics such as efficiency, braking, acceleration, and steering, the study shows that driving experience can lead to noticeable improvements of RDs and demonstrates how experience up to 600 km correlates with improved vehicle control. In addition, driving efficiency exhibited a positive trend with increasing kilometers, particularly during the first 300 km of experience, which reaches a plateau from 400 km within a range of 0.35 to 0.42 km/min in the defined ODD. The research further compares ODD-specific training methods, where the detailed ODD training approaches attains notable advantages over other training approaches. The findings underscore the importance of tailored ODD training in enhancing RD performance, safety, and scalability for Remote Driving System (RDS) in real-world applications, while identifying opportunities for optimizing training protocols to address both routine and extreme scenarios. The study provides a robust foundation for advancing RDS deployment within urban environments, contributing to the development of scalable and safety-critical remote operation standards.</description>

      <title>Energy-Aware Lane Planning for Connected Electric Vehicles in Urban Traffic: Design and Vehicle-in-the-Loop Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban driving with connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) offers potential for energy savings, yet most eco-driving strategies focus solely on longitudinal speed control within a single lane. This neglects the significant impact of lateral decisions, such as lane changes, on overall energy efficiency, especially in environments with traffic signals and heterogeneous traffic flow. To address this gap, we propose a novel energy-aware motion planning framework that jointly optimizes longitudinal speed and lateral lane-change decisions using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication. Our approach estimates long-term energy costs using a graph-based approximation and solves short-horizon optimal control problems under traffic constraints. Using a data-driven energy model calibrated to an actual battery electric vehicle, we demonstrate with vehicle-in-the-loop experiments that our method reduces motion energy consumption by up to 24 percent compared to a human driver, highlighting the potential of connectivity-enabled planning for sustainable urban autonomy.</description>

      <title>Iterative VCG-based Mechanism Fosters Cooperation in Multi-Regional Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation network design often involves multiple stakeholders with diverse priorities. We consider a system with a hierarchical multi-agent structure, featuring self-optimized subnetwork operators at the lower level and a central organization at the upper level. Independent regional planning can lead to inefficiencies due to the lack of coordination, hindering interregional travel and cross-border infrastructure development, while centralized methods may struggle to align local interests and can be impractical to implement. To support decision making for such a system, we introduce an iterative VCG-based mechanism for multi-regional network design that fosters cooperation among subnetwork operators. By leveraging the Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, the framework determines collective investment decisions and the necessary payments from both operators and the central organization to achieve efficient outcomes. A case study on the European Railway System validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating significant improvements in overall network performance through enhanced cross-region cooperation.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safe and Smooth Control in Safety-Critical Systems via Filtered Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input variation is essential for theoretical guarantees and practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints but often lead to nonsmooth or discontinuous control inputs that can degrade system performance or violate actuator limitations. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), a novel extension of HOCBFs that incorporates an auxiliary dynamic system-referred to as an input regularization filter-to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and smoothness simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided, and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.</description>

      <title>A Time Splitting Based Optimization Method for Nonlinear MHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving Horizon Estimation~(MHE) is essentially an optimization-based approach designed to estimate the states of dynamic systems within a moving time horizon. Traditional MHE solutions become computationally prohibitive due to the \textit{curse of dimensionality} arising from increasing problem complexity and growing length of time horizon. To address this issue, we propose novel computationally efficient algorithms for solving nonlinear MHE problems. Specifically, we first introduce a distributed reformulation utilizing a time-splitting technique. Leveraging this reformulation, we develop the Efficient Gauss-Newton Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN) to achieve computational efficiency. Additionally, to accommodate limited computational capabilities inherent in some sub-problem solvers, we propose the Efficient Sensitivity Assisted ALADIN, which enables sub-problems to be solved inexactly without hindering computational efficiency. Furthermore, recognizing scenarios where sub-problem solvers possess no computational power, we propose a Distributed Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) that relies solely on first- and second-order information of local objective functions. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our proposed methods through numerical experiments on differential drive robots case, a practical nonlinear MHE problem. Our results demonstrate that the three proposed algorithms achieve computational efficiency while preserving high accuracy, thereby satisfying the real-time requirements of MHE.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Adaptive Deep Koopman Operator Modeling for Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator has been recognized as an ongoing data-driven modeling method for vehicle dynamics which lifts the original state space into a high-dimensional linear state space. The deep neural networks (DNNs) are verified to be useful for the approximation of Koopman operator. To further improve the accuracy of Koopman operator approximation, this paper introduces a physical loss function term from the concept of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), i.e., the acceleration loss between neural network output and sensor measurements, to improve the efficiency of network learning and its interpretability. Moreover, we utilize the sliding window least squares (SWLS) to update the system matrix and input matrix online in the lifted space, therefore enabling the deep Koopman operator to adapt to the rapid dynamics of autonomous vehicles in real events. The data collection and validation are conducted on CarSim/Simlink co-simulation platform. With comparison to other physics-based and data-driven approaches on various scenarios, the results reveal that the acceleration loss-informed network refines the accuracy of Koopman operator approximation and renders it with inherent generalization, and the SWLS enforces the deep Koopman operator's capability to cope with changes in vehicle parameters, road conditions, and rapid maneuvers. This indicates the proposed physics-informed adaptive deep Koopman operator is a performant and efficient data-driven modeling tool.</description>

      <title>Distributed Design of Ultra Large-Scale Control Systems: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from large centralized complex control systems to distributed configurations that rely on a network of a very large number of interconnected simpler subsystems is ongoing and inevitable in many applications. It is attributed to the quest for resilience, flexibility, and scalability in a multitude of engineering fields with far-reaching societal impact. Although many design methods for distributed and decentralized control systems are available, most of them rely on a centralized design procedure requiring some form of global information of the whole system. Clearly, beyond a certain scale of the network, these centralized design procedures for distributed controllers are no longer feasible and we refer to the corresponding systems as ultra large-scale systems (ULSS). For these ULSS, design algorithms are needed that are distributed themselves among the subsystems and are subject to stringent requirements regarding communication, computation, and memory usage of each subsystem. In this paper, a set of requirements is provided that assures a feasible real-time implementation of all phases of a control solution on an ultra large scale. State-of-the-art approaches are reviewed in the light of these requirements and the challenges hampering the development of befitting control algorithms are pinpointed. Comparing the challenges with the current progress leads to the identification and motivation of promising research directions.</description>

      <title>Exact Characterization of Aggregate Flexibility via Generalized Polymatroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is growing interest in utilizing the flexibility in populations of distributed energy resources (DER) to mitigate the intermittency and uncertainty of renewable generation and provide additional grid services. To enable this, aggregators must effectively represent the flexibility in the populations they control to the market or system operator. A key challenge is accurately computing the aggregate flexibility of a population, which can be formally expressed as the Minkowski sum of a collection of polytopes - a problem that is generally computationally intractable. However, the flexibility polytopes of many DERs exhibit structural symmetries that can be exploited for computational efficiency. To this end, we introduce generalized polymatroids - a family of polytope - into the flexibility aggregation literature. We demonstrate that individual flexibility sets belong to this family, enabling efficient computation of their Minkowski sum. For homogeneous populations of DERs we further derive simplifications that yield more succinct representations of aggregate flexibility. Additionally, we develop an efficient optimization framework over these sets and propose a vertex-based disaggregation method, to allocate aggregate flexibility among individual DERs. Finally, we validate the optimality and computational efficiency of our approach through comparisons with existing methods.</description>

      <title>Loss-aware Pricing Strategies for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer(P2P) energy trading may increase efficiency and reduce costs, but introduces significant challenges for network operators such as maintaining grid reliability, accounting for network losses, and redistributing costs equitably. We propose a novel loss-aware pricing strategy for P2P energy markets that addresses these challenges while incentivizing participation in the cooperative energy trading market. The problem is formulated as a hierarchical Stackelberg game, where a grid operator determines network tariffs while prosumers optimize their trades based on these tariffs while guaranteeing that network constraints are satisfied. The algorithm is designed to minimize and recover their cost from the trading parties, while also minimizing the total cost of the hubs. The mechanism dynamically adjusts tariffs based on location and network topology, discouraging loss-intensive trades. Finally, the complete framework includes the computation of fair trading prices, ensuring all market participants benefit equitably. An ADMM-based hyper-gradient descent method is proposed for solving this problem. Extensive numerical simulations using the benchmark IEEE 33-bus system demonstrate significant cost reductions and improved network efficiency through reduction in network losses compared to constant tariff schemes. Results highlight the adaptability and scalability of the proposed mechanism to varying network configurations and size, demand profiles, and seasonal conditions.</description>

      <title>Intent-Aware MPC for Aircraft Detect-and-Avoid with Response Delay: A Comparative Study with ACAS Xu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intent-aware Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach for the remain-well-clear (RWC) functionality of a multi-agent aircraft detect-and-avoid (DAA) system and compare its performance with the standardized Airborne Collision Avoidance System Xu (ACAS Xu). The aircraft system is modeled as a linear system for horizontal maneuvering, with advisories on the rate of turn as the control input. Both deterministic and stochastic time delays are considered to account for the lag between control guidance issuance and the response of the aircraft. The capability of the MPC scheme in producing an optimal control profile over the entire horizon is used to mitigate the impact of the delay. We compare the proposed MPC method with ACAS Xu using various evaluation metrics, including loss of DAA well-clear percentage, near mid-air collision percentage, horizontal miss distance, and additional flight distance across different encounter scenarios. It is shown that the MPC scheme achieves better evaluation metrics than ACAS Xu for both deterministic and stochastic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Age of Information in Networks with Large and Small Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern sensing and monitoring applications typically consist of sources transmitting updates of different sizes, ranging from a few bytes (position, temperature, etc.) to multiple megabytes (images, video frames, LIDAR point scans, etc.). Existing approaches to wireless scheduling for information freshness typically ignore this mix of large and small updates, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we consider a single-hop wireless broadcast network with sources transmitting updates of different sizes to a base station over unreliable links. Some sources send large updates spanning many time slots while others send small updates spanning only a few time slots. Due to medium access constraints, only one source can transmit to the base station at any given time, thus requiring careful design of scheduling policies that takes the sizes of updates into account. First, we derive a lower bound on the achievable Age of Information (AoI) by any transmission scheduling policy. Second, we develop optimal randomized policies that consider both switching and no-switching during the transmission of large updates. Third, we introduce a novel Lyapunov function and associated analysis to propose an AoI-based Max-Weight policy that has provable constant factor optimality guarantees. Finally, we evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed scheduling policies through simulations, which show that our Max-Weight policy achieves near-optimal AoI performance.</description>

      <title>Stability and Controllability of Revenue Systems via the Bode Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In online revenue systems, e.g. an advertising system, budget pacing plays a critical role in ensuring that the spend aligns with desired financial objectives. Pacing systems dynamically control the velocity of spending to balance auction intensity, traffic fluctuations, and other stochastic variables. Current industry practices rely heavily on trial-and-error approaches, often leading to inefficiencies and instability. This paper introduces a principled methodology rooted in Classical Control Theory to address these challenges. By modeling the pacing system as a linear time-invariant (LTI) proxy and leveraging compensator design techniques using Bode methodology, we derive a robust controller to minimize pacing errors and enhance stability. The proposed methodology is validated through simulation and tested by our in-house auction system, demonstrating superior performance in achieving precise budget allocation while maintaining resilience to traffic and auction dynamics. Our findings bridge the gap between traditional control theory and modern advertising systems in modeling, simulation, and validation, offering a scalable and systematic approach to budget pacing optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Steady-State Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation in the presence of uncertain or data-driven noise distributions remains a critical challenge in control and robotics. Although the Kalman filter is the most popular choice, its performance degrades significantly when distributional mismatches occur, potentially leading to instability or divergence. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel steady-state distributionally robust (DR) Kalman filter that leverages Wasserstein ambiguity sets to explicitly account for uncertainties in both process and measurement noise distributions. Our filter achieves computational efficiency by requiring merely the offline solution of a single convex semidefinite program, which yields a constant DR Kalman gain for robust state estimation under distributional mismatches. Additionally, we derive explicit theoretical conditions on the ambiguity set radius that ensure the asymptotic convergence of the time-varying DR Kalman filter to the proposed steady-state solution. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baseline filters in terms of robustness and accuracy across both Gaussian and non-Gaussian uncertainty scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for real-world control and estimation applications.</description>

      <title>On the Analysis of Qualitative Nyquist Plots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A powerful tool in control and systems engineering is represented by Nyquist plots, for which a qualitative representation often gives a clearer visualization of the frequency response function that is typically not given by computer programs, especially if portions of the Nyquist plot extend to infinity. This letter addresses the graphical analysis of the frequency response function, with the objective of enhancing the procedure for the qualitative construction of Nyquist plots. Several results supported by analytical proofs are derived for what concerns the low and high frequency behavior, which enable to improve the qualitative construction of Nyquist plots in the vicinity of the initial and final points.</description>

      <title>Free Parametrization of L2-bounded State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structured state-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a powerful architecture in machine learning and control, featuring stacked layers where each consists of a linear time-invariant (LTI) discrete-time system followed by a nonlinearity. While SSMs offer computational efficiency and excel in long-sequence predictions, their widespread adoption in applications like system identification and optimal control is hindered by the challenge of ensuring their stability and robustness properties. We introduce L2RU, a novel parametrization of SSMs that guarantees input-output stability and robustness by enforcing a prescribed L-bound for all parameter values. This design eliminates the need for complex constraints, allowing unconstrained optimization over L2RUs by using standard methods such as gradient descent. Leveraging tools from system theory and convex optimization, we derive a non-conservative parametrization of square discrete-time LTI systems with a specified L2-bound, forming the foundation of the L2RU architecture. Additionally, we enhance its performance with a bespoke initialization strategy optimized for long input sequences. Through a system identification task, we validate L2RU's superior performance, showcasing its potential in learning and control applications.</description>

      <title>Incremental capacity-based multi-feature fusion model for predicting state-of-health of lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have become an indispensable part of human industrial production and daily life. For the safe use, management and maintenance of lithium-ion batteries, the state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries is an important indicator so that the SOH estimation is of significant practical value. In order to accurately predict SOH, this paper proposes a fusion prediction model which combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, bi-directional long-short time memory network (BiLSTM) and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. In the proposed prediction model, indirect health indicators (HIs), which characterize battery degradation, are obtained with the help of incremental capacity analysis (ICA), and is fed into BiLSTM to extract time-series features, whose parameters are optimized by employing PSO algorithm. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied to reduce the risk of overfitting the PSO-BiLSTM model. The study based on lithium-ion battery data from Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering (CALCE) shows that the PSO-BiLSTM-AdaBoost model has higher accuracy, better robustness, and generalization ability.</description>

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) operate in dynamic environments, leading to different types of uncertainty. This work provides a comprehensive review of uncertainty representations and categorizes them based on the dimensions used to represent uncertainty. Through this categorization, key gaps and limitations in existing approaches are identified. To address these issues, a Conceptual Model of Uncertainty Representations in CPS is introduced, integrating and extending existing models. Its applicability is demonstrated through examples from the automotive domain, showing its effectiveness in capturing and structuring uncertainty in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preservation for Statistical Input in Dynamical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of privacy preservation for statistical inputs in dynamical systems. Motivated by an autonomous building application, we formulate a privacy preservation problem for statistical inputs in linear time-invariant systems. What makes this problem widely applicable is that the inputs, rather than being assumed to be deterministic, follow a probability distribution, inherently embedding privacy-sensitive information that requires protection. This formulation also presents a technical challenge as conventional differential privacy mechanisms are not directly applicable. Through rigorous analysis, we develop strategy to achieve $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy through adding noise. Finally, the effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated by revisiting the autonomous building application.</description>

      <title>Certified Approximate Reachability (CARe): Formal Error Bounds on Deep Learning of Reachable Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches to leveraging deep learning for computing reachable sets of continuous-time dynamical systems have gained popularity over traditional level-set methods, as they overcome the curse of dimensionality. However, as with level-set methods, considerable care needs to be taken in limiting approximation errors, particularly since no guarantees are provided during training on the accuracy of the learned reachable set. To address this limitation, we introduce an epsilon-approximate Hamilton-Jacobi Partial Differential Equation (HJ-PDE), which establishes a relationship between training loss and accuracy of the true reachable set. To formally certify this approximation, we leverage Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers to bound the residual error of the HJ-based loss function across the domain of interest. Leveraging Counter Example Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS), we close the loop around learning and verification, by fine-tuning the neural network on counterexamples found by the SMT solver, thus improving the accuracy of the learned reachable set. To the best of our knowledge, Certified Approximate Reachability (CARe) is the first approach to provide soundness guarantees on learned reachable sets of continuous dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Two-wheel-driven Electric Superbike Powertrain Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the powertrain design of a two-wheel-driven electric superbike, minimizing energy consumption. Specifically, we jointly optimize the force distribution between the wheels with the gear ratio, and rear motor and battery sizing while explicitly considering vehicle dynamics and performance constraints. First, we present an energy consumption model of the vehicle, including a scalable model of the electric machine based on data from the industry, accounting for iron, copper, and mechanical losses. Then, we analyze the propulsive blending strategy to distribute the required power to the wheels while considering adherence limits. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing the design of a superbike, based on regulatory driving cycles and a custom high-performance circuit by comparing the force distribution approaches. The results underline the significance of joint optimization of powertrain components and propulsive bias, achieving a reduction of up to 22.36% in energy consumption for the Sport high-performance driving cycle.</description>

      <title>Consensus on Open Multi-Agent Systems Over Graphs Sampled from Graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how graphons can be used to model and analyze open multi-agent systems, which are multi-agent systems subject to arrivals and departures, in the specific case of linear consensus. First, we analyze the case of replacements, where under the assumption of a deterministic interval between two replacements, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation. Then, we study the case of arrivals and departures, where we define a process for the evolution of the number of agents that guarantees a minimum and a maximum number of agents. Next, we derive an upper bound for the disagreement in expectation, and we establish a link with the spectrum of the expected graph used to generate the graph topologies. Finally, for stochastic block model (SBM) graphons, we prove that the computation of the spectrum of the expected graph can be performed based on a matrix whose dimension depends only on the graphon and it is independent of the number of agents.</description>

      <title>An ANN-Enhanced Approach for Flatness-Based Constrained Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have proven practical for a synergistic combination of advanced control techniques. This work analyzes the implementation of rectified linear unit neural networks to achieve constrained control in differentially flat systems. Specifically, the class of flat systems enjoys the benefit of feedback linearizability, i.e., the systems can be linearized by means of a proper variable transformation. However, the price for linearizing the dynamics is that the constraint descriptions are distorted geometrically. Our results show that, by using neural networks, these constraints can be represented as a union of polytopes, enabling the use of mixed-integer programming tools to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We further analyze the integration of the characterization into efficient settings such as control Lyapunov function-based and model predictive control (MPC). Interestingly, this description also allows us to explicitly compute the solution of the MPC problem for the nonlinear system. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Unraveling tensor structures in correct-by-design controller synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal safety guarantees on the synthesis of controllers for stochastic systems can be obtained using correct-by-design approaches. These approaches often use abstractions as finite-state Markov Decision Processes. As the state space of these MDPs grows, the curse of dimensionality makes the computational and memory cost of the probabilistic guarantees, quantified with dynamic programming, scale exponentially. In this work, we leverage decoupled dynamics and unravel, via dynamic programming operations, a tree structure in the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of the value functions.
  For discrete-time stochastic systems with syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL) specifications, we provide provable probabilistic safety guarantees and significantly alleviate the computational burden. We provide an initial validation of the theoretical results on several typical case studies and showcase that the uncovered tree structure enables efficient reductions in the computational burden.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate initial state privacy protection for discrete-time nonlinear closed systems. By capturing Riemannian geometric structures inherent in such privacy challenges, we refine the concept of differential privacy through the introduction of an initial state adjacency set based on Riemannian distances. A new differential privacy condition is formulated using incremental output boundedness, enabling the design of time-varying Laplacian noise to achieve specified privacy guarantees. The proposed framework extends beyond initial state protection to also cover system parameter privacy, which is demonstrated as a special application.</description>

      <title>Application of Battery Storage to Switching Predictive Control of Power Distribution Systems Including Road Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A road heating system is an electrical device which promotes snow melting by burying a heating cable as a thermal source underground. When integrating road heating into the power distribution system, we need to optimize the flow of electric power by appropriately integrating distributed power sources and conventional power distribution equipment. In this paper, we extend the power distribution system considered in the authors' previous study to the case where battery storage is installed. As a main result, we propose a predictive switching control that achieves the reduction of distribution loss, attenuation of voltage fluctuation, and efficient snow melting, simultaneously. We verify the effectiveness of the application of battery storage through numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Distributed Output Synchronization of Heterogeneous Discrete-Time Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we assume that an autonomous exosystem generates a reference output, and we consider the problem of designing a distributed data-driven control law for a family of discrete-time heterogeneous LTI agents, connected through a directed graph, in order to synchronize the agents' outputs to the reference one. The agents of the network are split into two categories: leaders, with direct access to the exosystem output, and followers, that only receive information from their neighbors. All agents aim to achieve output synchronization by means of a state feedback that makes use of their own states as well as of an estimate of the exogenous system state, provided by an internal state observer. Such observer has a different structure for leaders and followers. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution are first derived in the model-based set-up and then in a data-driven context. An example illustrates both the implementation procedure and the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-level Dynamics and System-Level Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-Forming (GFM) technology is considered a promising solution to build power electronics-dominated power systems. However, the impact of GFM converters on the system stability is still unquantified, creating a gap between the system- and device-level perspectives. To fill this gap, at the device-level, we propose a Forming Index to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage variations, providing a characterization of its GFM behavior. At the system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to capture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we establish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by demonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-adaptive Model Predictive Control for Bounded Average Constraint Violations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers stochastic linear time-invariant systems subject to constraints on the average number of state-constraint violations over time without knowing the disturbance distribution. We present a novel disturbance-adaptive model predictive control (DAD-MPC) framework, which adjusts the disturbance model based on measured constraint violations. Using a robust invariance method, DAD-MPC ensures recursive feasibility and guarantees asymptotic or robust bounds on average constraint violations. Additionally, the bounds hold even with an inaccurate disturbance model, which allows for data-driven disturbance quantification methods to be used, such as conformal prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods while satisfying average violation constraints.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the French system imbalance paving the way for a novel operating reserve sizing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between system imbalance and several explanatory variables within the French electricity system. The factors considered include lagged imbalance values, observations of renewable energy sources (RES) generation and consumption, and forecasts for RES generation and consumption. The study analyzes the distribution of system imbalance in relation to these variables. Additionally, an HGBR machine-learning model is employed to assess the predictability of imbalances and the explanatory power of the input variables studied.
  The results indicate no clear correlation between RES generation or consumption and the observed imbalances. However, it is possible to predict the imbalance adequately using forecasts available a few hours before real-time, along with the lagged values of the imbalance. Predicting the imbalance a day in advance proves to be complex with the variables examined; however, the extreme quantiles of the imbalance used for reserve sizing and contracting can be predicted with sufficient accuracy.</description>

      <title>Coordinating Distributed Energy Resources with Nodal Pricing in Distribution Networks: a Game-Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a real-time nodal pricing mechanism for cost minimization and voltage control in a distribution network with autonomous distributed energy resources and analyze the resulting market using stochastic game theory. Unlike existing methods, the proposed pricing scheme does not require device-aware centralized coordination or communication between prosumers. By developing new sufficient conditions under which a stochastic game is a Markov potential game, we show that the problem of computing an equilibrium for the proposed model is equivalent to solving a single-agent Markov Decision Process. These new conditions are general and may apply to other applications. We compute the equilibrium for an IEEE test system to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the pricing policy.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient for LQR with Domain Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain randomization (DR) enables sim-to-real transfer by training controllers on a distribution of simulated environments, with the goal of achieving robust performance in the real world. Although DR is widely used in practice and is often solved using simple policy gradient (PG) methods, understanding of its theoretical guarantees remains limited. Toward addressing this gap, we provide the first convergence analysis of PG methods for domain-randomized linear quadratic regulation (LQR). We show that PG converges globally to the minimizer of a finite-sample approximation of the DR objective under suitable bounds on the heterogeneity of the sampled systems. We also quantify the sample-complexity associated with achieving a small performance gap between the sample-average and population-level objectives. Additionally, we propose and analyze a discount-factor annealing algorithm that obviates the need for an initial jointly stabilizing controller, which may be challenging to find. Empirical results support our theoretical findings and highlight promising directions for future work, including risk-sensitive DR formulations and stochastic PG algorithms.</description>

      <title>PowerGNN: A Topology-Aware Graph Neural Network for Electricity Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant variability and uncertainty in modern power systems, making accurate state prediction critical for reliable grid operation. Conventional forecasting methods often neglect the power grid's inherent topology, limiting their ability to capture complex spatio temporal dependencies. This paper proposes a topology aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for predicting power system states under high renewable integration. We construct a graph based representation of the power network, modeling buses and transmission lines as nodes and edges, and introduce a specialized GNN architecture that integrates GraphSAGE convolutions with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to model both spatial and temporal correlations in system dynamics. The model is trained and evaluated on the NREL 118 test system using realistic, time synchronous renewable generation profiles. Our results show that the proposed GNN outperforms baseline approaches including fully connected neural networks, linear regression, and rolling mean models, achieving substantial improvements in predictive accuracy. The GNN achieves average RMSEs of 0.13 to 0.17 across all predicted variables and demonstrates consistent performance across spatial locations and operational conditions. These results highlight the potential of topology aware learning for scalable and robust power system forecasting in future grids with high renewable penetration.</description>

      <title>Strategies for decentralised UAV-based collisions monitoring in rugby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) technology have opened new avenues for dynamic data collection in challenging environments, such as sports fields during fast-paced sports action. For the purposes of monitoring sport events for dangerous injuries, we envision a coordinated UAV fleet designed to capture high-quality, multi-view video footage of collision events in real-time. The extracted video data is crucial for analyzing athletes' motions and investigating the probability of sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBI) during impacts. This research implemented a UAV fleet system on the NetLogo platform, utilizing custom collision detection algorithms to compare against traditional TV-coverage strategies. Our system supports decentralized data capture and autonomous processing, providing resilience in the rapidly evolving dynamics of sports collisions.
  The collaboration algorithm integrates both shared and local data to generate multi-step analyses aimed at determining the efficacy of custom methods in enhancing the accuracy of TBI prediction models. Missions are simulated in real-time within a two-dimensional model, focusing on the strategic capture of collision events that could lead to TBI, while considering operational constraints such as rapid UAV maneuvering and optimal positioning. Preliminary results from the NetLogo simulations suggest that custom collision detection methods offer superior performance over standard TV-coverage strategies by enabling more precise and timely data capture. This comparative analysis highlights the advantages of tailored algorithmic approaches in critical sports safety applications.</description>

      <title>Distances between finite-horizon linear behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper introduces a class of distances for linear behaviors over finite time horizons. These distances allow for comparisons between finite-horizon linear behaviors represented by matrices of possibly different dimensions. They remain invariant under coordinate changes, rotations, and permutations, ensuring independence from input-output partitions. Moreover, they naturally encode complexity-misfit trade-offs for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) behaviors, providing a principled solution to a longstanding puzzle in behavioral systems theory. The resulting framework characterizes modeling as a minimum distance problem, identifying the Most Powerful Unfalsified Model (MPUM) as optimal among all systems unfalsified by a given dataset.</description>

      <title>Representation and Stability Analysis of 1D PDEs with Periodic Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22896v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PDEs with periodic boundary conditions are frequently used to model processes in large spatial environments, assuming solutions to extend periodically beyond some bounded interval. However, for 2nd order PDEs with periodic boundary conditions, the nullspace of the differential operator $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$ is nontrivial on the PDE domain, and solutions may converge to non-stationary trajectories existing in this nullspace. To test this convergence behaviour, in this paper, it is shown how we can model these trajectories for a broad class of linear, 2nd order, 1D PDEs with periodic as well as more general boundary conditions, using the Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. In particular, it is first shown how any function $\mathbf{u}(t)$ in the PDE domain can be decomposed into a component defined by $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$, and a component $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$ existing in the nullspace of $\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}$. An equivalent representation of linear PDEs is then derived as a PIE, explicitly defining the dynamics of both $\mathbf{u}_{xx}(t)$ and $\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$. Finally, a notion of exponential stability is defined for trajectories $\mathbf{u}^*(t)=\bar{\mathbf{u}}(t)$, and it is shown that stability of these trajectories as well as of the equilibrium $\mathbf{u}^*\equiv0$ can be tested by solving a linear operator inequality. The proposed methodology is applied to two examples, demonstrating that stability can be verified with tight bounds on the rate of exponential decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, a miniaturized, automated, and cost-effective ELISA device is designed and implemented, without the utilization of conventional techniques such as pipetting or microfluidic valve technologies. The device has dimensions of 24 cm x 19 cm x 14 cm and weighs &lt;3 Kg. The total hardware cost of the device is estimated to be approximately $1,200, which can be further reduced through optimization during scale-up production. 3D printed disposable parts, including the reagent reservoir disk and the microfluidic connector, have also been developed. IL-6 is used as a model system to demonstrate how the device provides an ELISA measurement. The cost per test is estimated to be less than ten dollars. The compactness, automated operation, along with the cost-effectiveness of this ELISA device, makes it suitable for point-of-care applications in resource-limited regions.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Collaborative Neurodynamic Approach to Compute Nash Equilibrium in Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nash Equilibrium (NE), one of the elegant and fundamental concepts in game theory, plays a crucial part within various fields, including engineering and computer science. However, efficiently computing an NE in normal-form games remains a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale problems. In contrast to widely applied simplicial and homotopy methods, this paper designs a novel Adaptive Collaborative Neurodynamic Approach (ACNA), which for the first time guarantees both exact and global NE computation for general $N$-player normal-form games with mixed strategies, where the payoff functions are non-convex and the pseudo-gradient is non-monotone. Additionally, leveraging the adaptive penalty method, the ACNA ensures its state enters the constraint set in finite time, which avoids the second-order sufficiency conditions required by Lagrangian methods, and the computationally complicated penalty parameter estimation needed by exact penalty methods. Furthermore, by incorporating the particle swarm algorithm, it is demonstrated that the ACNA achieves global convergence to an exact NE with probability one. At last, a simulation is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization and Integral Quadratic Constraints: A new approach to regret analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for analyzing dynamic regret of first-order constrained online convex optimization algorithms for strongly convex and Lipschitz-smooth objectives. Crucially, we provide a general analysis that is applicable to a wide range of first-order algorithms that can be expressed as an interconnection of a linear dynamical system in feedback with a first-order oracle. By leveraging Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs), we derive a semi-definite program which, when feasible, provides a regret guarantee for the online algorithm. For this, the concept of variational IQCs is introduced as the generalization of IQCs to time-varying monotone operators. Our bounds capture the temporal rate of change of the problem in the form of the path length of the time-varying minimizer and the objective function variation. In contrast to standard results in OCO, our results do not require nerither the assumption of gradient boundedness, nor that of a bounded feasible set. Numerical analyses showcase the ability of the approach to capture the dependence of the regret on the function class condition number.</description>

Abstract: This work explores generalizations of the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality (PLI) and their implications for the convergence behavior of gradient flows in optimization problems. Motivated by the continuous-time linear quadratic regulator (CT-LQR) policy optimization problem -- where only a weaker version of the PLI is characterized in the literature -- this work shows that while weaker conditions are sufficient for global convergence to, and optimality of the set of critical points of the cost function, the "profile" of the gradient flow solution can change significantly depending on which "flavor" of inequality the cost satisfies. After a general theoretical analysis, we focus on fitting the CT-LQR policy optimization problem to the proposed framework, showing that, in fact, it can never satisfy a PLI in its strongest form. We follow up our analysis with a brief discussion on the difference between continuous- and discrete-time LQR policy optimization, and end the paper with some intuition on the extension of this framework to optimization problems with L1 regularization and solved through proximal gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving using Target Funnels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-driving vehicles rely on sensory input to monitor their surroundings and continuously adapt to the most likely future road course. Predictive trajectory planning is based on snapshots of the (uncertain) road course as a key input. Under noisy perception data, estimates of the road course can vary significantly, leading to indecisive and erratic steering behavior. To overcome this issue, this paper introduces a predictive trajectory planning algorithm with a novel objective function: instead of targeting a single reference trajectory based on the most likely road course, tracking a series of target reference sets, called a target funnel, is considered. The proposed planning algorithm integrates probabilistic information about the road course, and thus implicitly considers regular updates to road perception. Our solution is assessed in a case study using real driving data collected from a prototype vehicle. The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains tracking accuracy and substantially reduces undesirable steering commands in the presence of noisy road perception, achieving a 56% reduction in input costs compared to a certainty equivalent formulation.</description>

      <title>Robust Suboptimal Local Basis Function Algorithms for Identification of Nonstationary FIR Systems in Impulsive Noise Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While local basis function (LBF) estimation algorithms, commonly used for identifying/tracking systems with time-varying parameters, demonstrate good performance under the assumption of normally distributed measurement noise, the estimation results may significantly deviate from satisfactory when the noise distribution is impulsive in nature, for example, corrupted by outliers. This paper introduces a computationally efficient method to make the LBF estimator robust, enhancing its resistance to impulsive noise. First, the choice of basis functions is optimized based on the knowledge of parameter variation statistics. Then, the parameter tracking algorithm is made robust using the sequential data trimming technique. Finally, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm can undergo online tuning through parallel estimation and leave-one-out cross-validation.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Contextual Sampling for Nonlinear Data-Enabled Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) is a powerful data-driven approach for predictive control without requiring an explicit system model. However, its high computational cost limits its applicability to real-time robotic systems. For robotic applications such as motion planning and trajectory tracking, real-time control is crucial. Nonlinear DeePC either relies on large datasets or learning the nonlinearities to ensure predictive accuracy, leading to high computational complexity. This work introduces contextual sampling, a novel data selection strategy to handle nonlinearities for DeePC by dynamically selecting the most relevant data at each time step. By reducing the dataset size while preserving prediction accuracy, our method improves computational efficiency, of DeePC for real-time robotic applications. We validate our approach for autonomous vehicle motion planning. For a dataset size of 100 sub-trajectories, Contextual sampling DeePC reduces tracking error by 53.2 % compared to Leverage Score sampling. Additionally, Contextual sampling reduces max computation time by 87.2 % compared to using the full dataset of 491 sub-trajectories while achieving comparable tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of Contextual sampling to enable real-time, data-driven control for robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Model Order Reduction for Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate distributionally robust model order reduction for linear, discrete-time, time-invariant systems. The external input is assumed to follow an uncertain distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We begin by considering the case where the distribution is certain and formulate an optimization problem to obtain the reduced model. When the distribution is uncertain, the interaction between the reduced-order model and the distribution is modeled by a Stackelberg game. To ensure solvability, we first introduce the Gelbrich distance and demonstrate that the Stackelberg game within a Wasserstein ambiguity set is equivalent to that within a Gelbrich ambiguity set. Then, we propose a nested optimization problem to solve the Stackelberg game. Furthermore, the nested optimization problem is relaxed into a nested convex optimization problem, ensuring computational feasibility. Finally, a simulation is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A robot-assisted pipeline to rapidly scan 1.7 million historical aerial photographs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the 20th Century, aerial surveys captured hundreds of millions of high-resolution photographs of the earth's surface. These images, the precursors to modern satellite imagery, represent an extraordinary visual record of the environmental and social upheavals of the 20th Century. However, most of these images currently languish in physical archives where retrieval is difficult and costly. Digitization could revolutionize access, but manual scanning is slow and expensive. Here, we describe and validate a novel robot-assisted pipeline that increases worker productivity in scanning 30-fold, applied at scale to digitize an archive of 1.7 million historical aerial photographs from 65 countries.</description>

      <title>Distributed AC Optimal Power Flow: A Scalable Solution for Large-Scale Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel distributed optimization framework for large-scale AC Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, offering both theoretical convergence guarantees and rapid convergence in practice. By integrating smoothing techniques and the Schur complement, the proposed approach addresses the scalability challenges and reduces communication overhead in distributed AC OPF. Additionally, optimal network decomposition enables efficient parallel processing under the single program multiple data (SPMD) paradigm. Extensive simulations on large-scale benchmarks across various operating scenarios indicate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art centralized solver IPOPT on modest hardware. This paves the way for more scalable and efficient distributed optimization in future power system applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Feedback Optimization with Model Uncertainty: A Regularization Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feedback optimization optimizes the steady state of a dynamical system by implementing optimization iterations in closed loop with the plant. It relies on online measurements and limited model information, namely, the input-output sensitivity. In practice, various issues including inaccurate modeling, lack of observation, or changing conditions can lead to sensitivity mismatches, causing closed-loop sub-optimality or even instability. To handle such uncertainties, we pursue robust feedback optimization, where we optimize the closed-loop performance against all possible sensitivities lying in specific uncertainty sets. We provide tractable reformulations for the corresponding min-max problems via regularizations and characterize the online closed-loop performance through the tracking error in case of time-varying optimal solutions. Simulations on a distribution grid illustrate the effectiveness of our robust feedback optimization controller in addressing sensitivity mismatches in a non-stationary environment.</description>

      <title>A system level approach to generalised feedback Nash equilibrium seeking in partially-observed games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work proposes an algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria (GFNE) in noncooperative dynamic games. The focus is on cyber-physical systems with dynamics which are linear, stochastic, potentially unstable, and partially observed. We employ System Level Synthesis (SLS) to reformulate the problem as the search for an equilibrium profile of closed-loop responses to noise, which can then be used to reconstruct a stabilising output-feedback policy. Under this setup, we leverage monotone operator theory to design a GFNE-seeking algorithm capable to enforce closed-loop stability, operational constraints, and communication constraints onto the control policies. This algorithm is amenable to numerical implementation and we provide conditions for its convergence. We demonstrate our approach in a simulated experiment on the noncooperative stabilisation of a decentralised power-grid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems engineering, accurately decomposing requirements is crucial for creating well-defined and manageable system components, particularly in safety-critical domains. Despite the critical need, rigorous, top-down methodologies for effectively breaking down complex requirements into precise, actionable sub-requirements are scarce, especially compared to the wealth of bottom-up verification techniques. Addressing this gap, we introduce a formal decomposition for contract-based design that guarantees the correctness of decomposed requirements if specific conditions are met. Our (semi-)automated methodology augments contract-based design with reachability analysis and constraint programming to systematically identify, verify, and validate sub-requirements representable by continuous bounded sets -- continuous relations between real-valued inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of a correct-by-construction approach through a comprehensive case study on a cruise control system, highlighting how our methodology improves the interpretability, tractability, and verifiability of system requirements.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Control Family of Dynamical Systems for Universal Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universal approximation property (UAP) holds a fundamental position in deep learning, as it provides a theoretical foundation for the expressive power of neural networks. It is widely recognized that a composition of linear and nonlinear functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, can approximate continuous functions on compact domains. In this paper, we extend this efficacy to a scenario containing dynamical systems with controls. We prove that the control family $\mathcal{F}_1$ containing all affine maps and the nonlinear ReLU map is sufficient for generating flow maps that can approximate orientation-preserving (OP) diffeomorphisms on any compact domain. Since $\mathcal{F}_1$ contains only one nonlinear function and the UAP does not hold if we remove the nonlinear function, we call $\mathcal{F}_1$ a minimal control family for the UAP. On this basis, several mild sufficient conditions, such as affine invariance, are established for the control family and discussed. Our results reveal an underlying connection between the approximation power of neural networks and control systems and could provide theoretical guidance for examining the approximation power of flow-based models.</description>

      <title>Learning Algorithms for Verification of Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for applying learning algorithms and heuristical guidance to the verification of Markov decision processes (MDPs). The primary goal of our techniques is to improve performance by avoiding an exhaustive exploration of the state space, instead focussing on particularly relevant areas of the system, guided by heuristics. Our work builds on the previous results of Br{\'{a}}zdil et al., significantly extending it as well as refining several details and fixing errors.
  The presented framework focuses on probabilistic reachability, which is a core problem in verification, and is instantiated in two distinct scenarios. The first assumes that full knowledge of the MDP is available, in particular precise transition probabilities. It performs a heuristic-driven partial exploration of the model, yielding precise lower and upper bounds on the required probability. The second tackles the case where we may only sample the MDP without knowing the exact transition dynamics. Here, we obtain probabilistic guarantees, again in terms of both the lower and upper bounds, which provides efficient stopping criteria for the approximation. In particular, the latter is an extension of statistical model-checking (SMC) for unbounded properties in MDPs. In contrast to other related approaches, we do not restrict our attention to time-bounded (finite-horizon) or discounted properties, nor assume any particular structural properties of the MDP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript considers the problem of ensuring stability and safety during formation control with distributed multi-agent systems in the presence of parametric uncertainty in the dynamics and limited communication. We propose an integrative approach that combines Adaptive Control, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), and connected graphs. The main elements employed in the integrative approach are an adaptive control design that ensures stability, a CBF-based safety filter that generates safe commands based on a reference model dynamics, and a reference model that ensures formation control with multi-agent systems when no uncertainties are present. The overall control design is shown to lead to a closed-loop adaptive system that is stable, avoids unsafe regions, and converges to a desired formation of the multi-agents. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical derivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The signal differentiation problem involves the development of algorithms that allow to recover a signal's derivatives from noisy measurements. This paper develops a first-order differentiator with the following combination of properties: robustness to measurement noise, exactness in the absence of noise, optimal worst-case differentiation error, and Lipschitz continuous output where the output's Lipschitz constant is a tunable parameter. This combination of advantageous properties is not shared by any existing differentiator. Both continuous-time and sample-based versions of the differentiator are developed and theoretical guarantees are established for both. The continuous-time version of the differentiator consists in a regularized and sliding-mode-filtered linear adaptive differentiator. The sample-based, implementable version is then obtained through appropriate discretization. An illustrative example is provided to highlight the features of the developed differentiator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of incentivizing energy-constrained, non-cooperative user equipment (UE) to serve as cooperative relays. We consider a source UE with a non-line-of-sight channel to an access point (AP), where direct communication may be infeasible or may necessitate a substantial transmit power. Other UEs in the vicinity are viewed as relay candidates, and our aim is to enable energy-efficient connectivity for the source, while accounting for the self-interested behavior and private channel state information of these candidates, by allowing the source to ``pay" the candidates via wireless power transfer (WPT). We propose a cooperation-inducing protocol, inspired by Myerson auction theory, which ensures that candidates truthfully report power requirements while minimizing the expected power used by the source. Through rigorous analysis, we establish the regularity of valuations for lognormal fading channels, which allows for the efficient determination of the optimal source transmit power. Extensive simulation experiments, employing real-world communication and WPT parameters, validate our theoretical framework. Our results demonstrate over 71% reduction in outage probability with as few as 4 relay candidates, compared to the non-cooperative scenario, and as much as 70% source power savings compared to a baseline approach, highlighting the efficacy of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncrewed Vehicles (UVs) functioning as autonomous agents are anticipated to play a crucial role in the 6th Generation of wireless networks. Their seamless integration, cost-effectiveness, and the additional controllability through motion planning make them an attractive deployment option for a wide range of applications, both as assets in the network (e.g., mobile base stations) and as consumers of network services (e.g., autonomous delivery systems). However, despite their potential, the convergence of UVs and wireless systems brings forth numerous challenges that require attention from both academia and industry. This paper then aims to offer a comprehensive overview encompassing the transformative possibilities as well as the significant challenges associated with UV-assisted next-generation wireless communications. Considering the diverse landscape of possible application scenarios, problem formulations, and mathematical tools related to UV-assisted wireless systems, the underlying core theme of this paper is the unification of the problem space, providing a structured framework to understand the use cases, problem formulations, and necessary mathematical tools. Overall, the paper sets forth a clear understanding of how uncrewed vehicles can be integrated in the 6G ecosystem, paving the way towards harnessing the full potential at this intersection.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Curves for Optimally Efficient Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Market Makers (AMMs) are essential in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as they match liquidity supply with demand. They function through liquidity providers (LPs) who deposit assets into liquidity pools. However, the asset trading prices in these pools often trail behind those in more dynamic, centralized exchanges, leading to potential arbitrage losses for LPs. This issue is tackled by adapting market maker bonding curves to trader behavior, based on the classical market microstructure model of Glosten and Milgrom. Our approach ensures a zero-profit condition for the market maker's prices. We derive the differential equation that an optimal adaptive curve should follow to minimize arbitrage losses while remaining competitive. Solutions to this optimality equation are obtained for standard Gaussian and Lognormal price models using Kalman filtering. A key feature of our method is its ability to estimate the external market price without relying on price or loss oracles. We also provide an equivalent differential equation for the implied dynamics of canonical static bonding curves and establish conditions for their optimality. Our algorithms demonstrate robustness to changing market conditions and adversarial perturbations, and we offer an on-chain implementation using Uniswap v4 alongside off-chain AI co-processors.</description>

      <title>Balancing Operators Risk Averseness in Model Predictive Control for Real-time Reservoir Flood Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimal control strategy suited for flood control of water resources infrastructure. Despite many studies on reservoir flood control and their theoretical contribution, optimisation methodologies have not been widely applied in real-time operation due to disparities between research assumptions and practical requirements. To address this gap, we include practical objectives, such as minimising the magnitude and frequency of changes in the existing outflow schedule. Incorporating these objectives transforms the problem into a multi-objective nonlinear optimisation problem that is difficult to solve in real-time. Additionally, it is reasonable to assume that the weights and some parameters, considered the operators' preferences, vary depending on the system state. To overcome these limitations, we propose a framework that converts the original intractable problem into parameterized linear MPC problems with dynamic optimisation of weights and parameters. This is done by introducing a model-based learning concept. We refer to this framework as Parameterised Dynamic MPC (PD-MPC). The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through a numerical experiment for the Daecheong multipurpose reservoir in South Korea. We find that PD-MPC outperforms standard MPC-based designs without a dynamic optimisation process for the objective weights and model parameters. Moreover, we demonstrate that the weights and parameters vary with changing hydrological conditions.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Predictive Control for Aircraft Intent-Aware Collision Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the use of robust model predictive control for the design of an intent-aware collision avoidance system for multi-agent aircraft engaged in horizontal maneuvering scenarios. We assume that information from other agents is accessible in the form of waypoints or destinations. Consequently, we consider that other agents follow their optimal Dubin's path--a trajectory that connects their current state to their intended state--while accounting for potential uncertainties. We propose using scenario tree model predictive control as a robust approach that demonstrates computational efficiency. We demonstrate that the proposed method can easily integrate intent information and offer a robust scheme that handles different uncertainties. The method is illustrated through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Avoidance Feedback for Reactive Navigation Under Second-Order Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of autonomous robot navigation in unknown, obstacle-filled environments with second-order dynamics by proposing a Dissipative Avoidance Feedback (DAF). Compared to the Artificial Potential Field (APF), which primarily uses repulsive forces based on position, DAF employs a dissipative feedback mechanism that accounts for both position and velocity, contributing to smoother and more natural obstacle avoidance. The proposed continuously differentiable controller solves the motion-to-goal problem while guaranteeing collision-free navigation by using the robot's state and local obstacle distance information. We show that the controller guarantees safe navigation in generic $n$-dimensional environments and that all undesired $\omega$-limit points are unstable under certain controlled curvature conditions. Designed for real-time implementation, DAF requires only locally measured data from limited-range sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth cameras), making it particularly effective for robots navigating unknown workspaces. Simulations in 2D and 3D environments are conducted to validate the theoretical results and to showcase the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

Abstract: Accurate calculation of switching events is important for electromagnetic transient simulation to obtain reliable results. The common presumption of continuous differential state variables could prevent the accurate calculation, thus leading to unreliable results. This paper explores accurately calculating switching events without presuming continuous differential state variables. Possibility of the calculation is revealed by the proposal of related methods. Feasibility and accuracy of the proposed methods are demonstrated and analyzed via numerical case studies.</description>

      <title>Minimally Conservative Controlled-Invariant Set Synthesis Using Control Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a controlled-invariant set for a system with state and control constraints is crucial for safety-critical applications. However, existing methods often produce overly conservative solutions. This paper presents a method for generating controlled-invariant (safe) sets for nonlinear polynomial control-affine systems using Control Barrier Certificates (CBCs). We formulate CBC conditions as Sum-of-Squares (SOS) constraints and solve them via an SOS Program (SOSP). First, we generalize existing SOSPs for CBC synthesis to handle environments with complex unsafe state representations. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm that progressively enlarges the safe set constructed by the synthesized CBCs by maximizing boundary expansion at each iteration. We theoretically prove that our method guarantees strict safe set expansion at every step. Finally, we validate our approach with numerical simulations in 2D and 3D for single-input and multi-input systems. Empirical results show that the safe set generated by our method covers in most part a larger portion of the state space compared to two state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Safety Filter Design for Articulated Frame Steering Vehicles In the Presence of Actuator Dynamics Using High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Articulated Frame Steering (AFS) vehicles are widely used in heavy-duty industries, where they often operate near operators and laborers. Therefore, designing safe controllers for AFS vehicles is essential. In this paper, we develop a Quadratic Program (QP)-based safety filter that ensures feasibility for AFS vehicles with affine actuator dynamics. To achieve this, we first derive the general equations of motion for AFS vehicles, incorporating affine actuator dynamics. We then introduce a novel High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) candidate with equal relative degrees for both system controls. Finally, we design a Parametric Adaptive HOCBF (PACBF) and an always-feasible, QP-based safety filter. Numerical simulations of AFS vehicle kinematics demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Semantic Communications for Metaverse Construction via Generative AI and Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of the metaverse has boosted productivity and creativity, driving real-time updates and personalized content, which will substantially increase data traffic. However, current bit-oriented communication networks struggle to manage this high volume of dynamic information, restricting metaverse applications interactivity. To address this research gap, we propose a goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework for metaverse. Building on an existing metaverse wireless construction task, our proposed GSC framework includes an hourglass network-based (HgNet) encoder to extract semantic information of objects in the metaverse; and a semantic decoder that uses this extracted information to reconstruct the metaverse content after wireless transmission, enabling efficient communication and real-time object behaviour updates to the scenery for metaverse construction task. To overcome the wireless channel noise at the receiver, we design an optimal transport (OT)-enabled semantic denoiser, which enhances the accuracy of metaverse scenery through wireless communication. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional metaverse construction, our proposed GSC framework significantly reduces wireless metaverse construction latency by 92.6\%, while improving metaverse object status accuracy and viewing experience by 45.6\% and 44.7\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Bayesian Approach for System Identification based on Linear Gaussian Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a flexible and computationally tractable methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information from the model with respect to the parameters. Our algorithm consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and use a linear Gaussian model approximation to iteratively optimize the model's parameters. In each iteration, we propose to use the input-output data to tune the covariance of the linear Gaussian model. This statistically calibrates the approach. Secondly, we define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. We test our method with linear and nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Model Agents Balance Energy Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a multi-scenario Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) framework to enhance both efficiency and reliability under high wind generation uncertainties. In a 10-trial study on the test energy system, the traditional SUC approach incurs an average total cost of 187.68 million dollars, whereas the LLM-assisted SUC (LLM-SUC) achieves a mean cost of 185.58 million dollars (range: 182.61 to 188.65 million dollars), corresponding to a cost reduction of 1.1 to 2.7 percent. Furthermore, LLM-SUC reduces load curtailment by 26.3 percent (2.24 plus/minus 0.31 GWh versus 3.04 GWh for SUC), while both methods maintain zero wind curtailment. Detailed temporal analysis shows that LLM-SUC achieves lower costs in the majority of time intervals and consistently outperforms SUC in 90 percent of cases, with solutions clustering in a favorable cost-reliability region (Coefficient of Variation = 0.93 percent for total cost and 13.8 percent for load curtailment). By leveraging an LLM agent to guide generator commitment decisions and dynamically adjust to stochastic conditions, the proposed framework improves demand fulfillment and operational resilience.</description>

      <title>Understanding long-term energy use in off-grid solar home systems in sub-Saharan Africa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar home systems provide low-cost electricity access for rural off-grid communities. As access to them increases, more long-term data becomes available on how these systems are used throughout their lifetime. This work analyses a dataset of 1,000 systems across sub-Saharan Africa. Dynamic time warping clustering was applied to the load demand data from the systems, identifying five distinct archetypal daily load profiles and their occurrence across the dataset. Temporal analysis reveals a general decline in daily energy consumption over time, with 77% of households reducing their usage compared to the start of ownership. On average, there is a 33% decrease in daily consumption by the end of the second year compared to the peak demand, which occurs on the 96th day. Combining the load demand analysis with payment data shows that this decrease in energy consumption is observed even in households that are not experiencing economic hardship, indicating there are reasons beyond financial constraints for decreasing energy use once energy access is obtained.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach for stability analysis of multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) feedback systems through Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs). Unlike traditional methods, such as the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), which relies on a coupled analysis that requires the multiplication of models, our approach enables the evaluation of system stability in a decoupled fashion and provides an intuitive, visual representation of system behavior. Our results provide conditions for certifying the stability of feedback MIMO Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems.</description>

      <title>On the Standard Performance Criteria for Applied Control Design: PID, MPC or Machine Learning Controller?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional control theory and its application to basic and complex systems have reached an advanced level of maturity. This includes aerial, marine, and ground vehicles, as well as robotics, chemical, transportation, and electrical systems widely used in our daily lives. The emerging era of data-driven methods, Large Language Models (LLMs), and AI-based controllers does not indicate a weakness in well-established control theory. Instead, it aims to reduce dependence on models and uncertainties, address increasingly complex systems, and potentially achieve decision-making capabilities comparable to human-level performance. This revolution integrates knowledge from computer science, machine learning, biology, and classical control, producing promising algorithms that are yet to demonstrate widespread real-world applicability. Despite the maturity of control theory and the presence of various performance criteria, there is still a lack of standardised metrics for testing, evaluation, Verification and Validation ($V\&amp;V$) of algorithms. This gap can lead to algorithms that, while optimal in certain aspects, may fall short of practical implementation, sparking debates within the literature. For a controller to succeed in real-world applications, it must satisfy three key categories of performance metrics: tracking quality, control effort (energy consumption), and robustness. This paper rather takes an applied perspective, proposing and consolidating standard performance criteria for testing and analysing control systems, intended for researchers and students. The proposed framework ensures the post-design applicability of a black-box algorithm, aligning with modern data analysis and $V\&amp;V$ perspectives to prevent resource allocation to systems with limited impact or imprecise claims.</description>

      <title>Local Stability and Stabilization of Quadratic-Bilinear Systems using Petersen's Lemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quadratic-bilinear (QB) systems arise in many areas of science and engineering. In this paper, we present a scalable approach for designing locally stabilizing state-feedback control laws and certifying the local stability of QB systems. Sufficient conditions are established for local stability and stabilization based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, which also provide ellipsoidal inner-estimates for the region of attraction and region of stabilizability of an equilibrium point. Our formulation exploits Petersen's Lemma to convert the problem of certifying the sign-definiteness of the Lyapunov condition into a line search over a single scalar parameter. The resulting linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions scale quadratically with the state dimension for both stability analysis and control synthesis, thus enabling analysis and control of QB systems with hundreds of state variables without resorting to specialized implementations. We demonstrate the approach on three benchmark problems from the existing literature. In all cases, we find our formulation yields comparable approximations of stability domains as determined by other established tools that are otherwise restricted to systems with up to tens of state variables.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient UAV movement and user-UAV association in multi-UAV networks</title>

Abstract: These days, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based millimeter wave (mmWave) communication systems have drawn a lot of attention due to the increasing demand for faster data rates. Given the susceptibility of mmWave signals to obstacles and high propagation loss of mmWaves, ensuring line-of-sight (LoS) connectivity is critical for maintaining robust and efficient communication. Furthermore, UAVs have limited power resource and limited capacity in terms of number of users it can serve. Most significantly different users have different delay requirements and they keep moving while interacting with the UAVs. In this paper, first, we have provided an efficient solution for the optimal movement of the UAVs, by taking into account the energy efficiency of the UAVs as well as the mobility and delay priority of the users. Next, we have proposed a greedy solution for the optimal user-UAV assignment. After that, the numerical results show how well the suggested solution performs in comparison to the current benchmarks in terms of delay suffered by the users, number of unserved users, and energy efficiency of the UAVs.</description>

      <title>Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM): An Exact Analysis Tool for Deep-Learned Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are increasingly used in robotics as policies, state transition models, state estimation models, or all of the above. With these components being learned from data, it is important to be able to analyze what behaviors were learned and how this affects closed-loop performance. In this paper we take steps toward this goal by developing methods for computing control invariant sets and regions of attraction (ROAs) of dynamical systems represented as neural networks. We focus our attention on feedforward neural networks with the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation, which are known to implement continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) functions. We describe the Reachable Polyhedral Marching (RPM) algorithm for enumerating the affine pieces of a neural network through an incremental connected walk. We then use this algorithm to compute exact forward and backward reachable sets, from which we provide methods for computing control invariant sets and ROAs. Our approach is unique in that we find these sets incrementally, without Lyapunov-based tools. In our examples we demonstrate the ability of our approach to find non-convex control invariant sets and ROAs on tasks with learned van der Pol oscillator and pendulum models. Further, we provide an accelerated algorithm for computing ROAs that leverages the incremental and connected enumeration of affine regions that RPM provides. We show this acceleration to lead to a 15x speedup in our examples. Finally, we apply our methods to find a set of states that are stabilized by an image-based controller for an aircraft runway control problem.</description>

      <title>General Distribution Steering: A Sub-Optimal Solution by Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General distribution steering is intrinsically an infinite-dimensional problem, when the continuous distributions to steer are arbitrary. We put forward a moment representation of the primal system for control in [42]. However, the system trajectory was a predetermined one without optimization towards a design criterion, which doesn't always ensure a most satisfactory solution. In this paper, we propose an optimization approach to the general distribution steering problem of the first-order discrete-time linear system, i.e., an optimal control law for the corresponding moment system. The domain of all feasible control inputs is non-convex and has a complex topology. We obtain a subset of it by minimizing a weighted sum of squared integral distances alongside the system trajectory. The feasible domain is then proved convex, and the optimal control problem can be treated as a convex optimization or by exhaustive search, based on the type of the cost function. Algorithms of steering for continuous and discrete distributions are then put forward respectively, by adopting a realization scheme of control inputs. We also provide an explicit advantage of our proposed algorithm by truncated power moments to the prevailing Gaussian Mixture Models. Experiments on different types of cost functions are given to validate the performance of our proposed algorithm. Since the moment system is a dimension-reduced counterpart of the primal system, we call this solution a sub-optimal one to the primal general distribution steering problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To facilitate effective decarbonization of the electric power sector, this paper introduces the generic Carbon-aware Optimal Power Flow (C-OPF) method for power system decision-making that considers demand-side carbon accounting and emission management. Built upon the classic optimal power flow (OPF) model, the C-OPF method incorporates carbon emission flow equations and constraints, as well as carbon-related objectives, to jointly optimize power flow and carbon flow. In particular, this paper establishes the feasibility and solution uniqueness of the carbon emission flow equations, and proposes modeling and linearization techniques to address the issues of undetermined power flow directions and bilinear terms in the C-OPF model. Additionally, two novel carbon emission models, together with the carbon accounting schemes, for energy storage systems are developed and integrated into the C-OPF model. Numerical simulations demonstrate the characteristics and effectiveness of the C-OPF method, in comparison with OPF solutions.</description>

      <title>Cascade Reinforcement Learning with State Space Factorization for O-RAN-based Traffic Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture empowers intelligent and automated optimization of the RAN through applications deployed on the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) platform, enabling capabilities beyond what is achievable with traditional RAN solutions. Within this paradigm, Traffic Steering (TS) emerges as a pivotal RIC application that focuses on optimizing cell-level mobility settings in near-real-time, aiming to significantly improve network spectral efficiency. In this paper, we design a novel TS algorithm based on a Cascade Reinforcement Learning (CaRL) framework. We propose state space factorization and policy decomposition to reduce the need for large models and well-labeled datasets. For each sub-state space, an RL sub-policy will be trained to learn an optimized mapping onto the action space. To apply CaRL on new network regions, we propose a knowledge transfer approach to initialize a new sub-policy based on knowledge learned by the trained policies. To evaluate CaRL, we build a data-driven and scalable RIC digital twin (DT) that is modeled using important real-world data, including network configuration, user geo-distribution, and traffic demand, among others, from a tier-1 mobile operator in the US. We evaluate CaRL on two DT scenarios representing two network clusters in two different cities and compare its performance with the business-as-usual (BAU) policy and other competing optimization approaches using heuristic and Q-table algorithms. Benchmarking results show that CaRL performs the best and improves the average cluster-aggregated downlink throughput over the BAU policy by 24% and 18% in these two scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01116v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem. A video demonstrating the proposed architecture in multiple complex traffic scenarios can be found here: https://youtu.be/-pRiOnPb9_c.

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Participation Factors in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</description>

      <title>Rational-Exponent Filters with Applications to Generalized Exponent Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present filters with rational exponents in order to provide a continuum of filter behavior not classically achievable. We discuss their stability, the flexibility they afford, and various representations useful for analysis, design and implementations. We do this for a generalization of second-order filters which we refer to as rational-exponent Generalized Exponent Filters (GEFs) that are useful for a diverse array of applications. We present equivalent representations for rational-exponent GEFs in the time and frequency domains: transfer functions, impulse responses, and integral expressions - the last of which allows for efficient real-time processing without preprocessing requirements. Rational-exponent filters enable filter characteristics to be on a continuum rather than limiting them to discrete values thereby resulting in greater flexibility in the behavior of these filters without additional complexity in causality and stability analyses compared with classical filters. In the case of GEFs, this allows for having arbitrary continuous rather than discrete values for filter characteristics such as (1) the ratio of 3dB quality factor to maximum group delay - particularly important for filterbanks which have simultaneous requirements on frequency selectivity and synchronization; and (2) the ratio of 3dB to 15dB quality factors that dictates the shape of the frequency response magnitude.</description>

      <title>Inverse Particle Filter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cognitive systems, recent emphasis has been placed on studying the cognitive processes of the subject whose behavior was the primary focus of the system's cognitive response. This approach, known as inverse cognition, arises in counter-adversarial applications and has motivated the development of inverse Bayesian filters. In this context, a cognitive adversary, such as a radar, uses a forward Bayesian filter to track its target of interest. An inverse filter is then employed to infer the adversary's estimate of the target's or defender's state. Previous studies have addressed this inverse filtering problem by introducing methods like the inverse Kalman filter (KF), inverse extended KF, and inverse unscented KF. However, these filters typically assume additive Gaussian noise models and/or rely on local approximations of non-linear dynamics at the state estimates, limiting their practical application. In contrast, this paper adopts a global filtering approach and presents the development of an inverse particle filter (I-PF). The particle filter framework employs Monte Carlo (MC) methods to approximate arbitrary posterior distributions. Moreover, under mild system-level conditions, the proposed I-PF demonstrates convergence to the optimal inverse filter. Additionally, we propose the differentiable I-PF to address scenarios where system information is unknown to the defender. Using the recursive Cramer-Rao lower bound and non-credibility index (NCI), our numerical experiments for different systems demonstrate the estimation performance and time complexity of the proposed filter.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Covariate Shift in Imitation Learning for Autonomous Vehicles Using Latent Space Generative World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of latent space generative world models to address the covariate shift problem in autonomous driving. A world model is a neural network capable of predicting an agent's next state given past states and actions. By leveraging a world model during training, the driving policy effectively mitigates covariate shift without requiring an excessive amount of training data. During end-to-end training, our policy learns how to recover from errors by aligning with states observed in human demonstrations, so that at runtime it can recover from perturbations outside the training distribution. Additionally, we introduce a novel transformer-based perception encoder that employs multi-view cross-attention and a learned scene query. We present qualitative and quantitative results, demonstrating significant improvements upon prior state of the art in closed-loop testing in the CARLA simulator, as well as showing the ability to handle perturbations in both CARLA and NVIDIA's DRIVE Sim.</description>

      <title>Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions with Diffuser for Safety-Critical Trajectory Planning at Signal-Free Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planning safe and efficient trajectories through signal-free intersections presents significant challenges for autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in dynamic, multi-task environments with unpredictable interactions and an increased possibility of conflicts. This study aims to address these challenges by developing a unified, robust, adaptive framework to ensure safety and efficiency across three distinct intersection movements: left-turn, right-turn, and straight-ahead. Existing methods often struggle to reliably ensure safety and effectively learn multi-task behaviors from demonstrations in such environments. This study proposes a safety-critical planning method that integrates Dynamic High-Order Control Barrier Functions (DHOCBF) with a diffusion-based model, called Dynamic Safety-Critical Diffuser (DSC-Diffuser). The DSC-Diffuser leverages task-guided planning to enhance efficiency, allowing the simultaneous learning of multiple driving tasks from real-world expert demonstrations. Moreover, the incorporation of goal-oriented constraints significantly reduces displacement errors, ensuring precise trajectory execution. To further ensure driving safety in dynamic environments, the proposed DHOCBF framework dynamically adjusts to account for the movements of surrounding vehicles, offering enhanced adaptability and reduce the conservatism compared to traditional control barrier functions. Validity evaluations of DHOCBF, conducted through numerical simulations, demonstrate its robustness in adapting to variations in obstacle velocities, sizes, uncertainties, and locations, effectively maintaining driving safety across a wide range of complex and uncertain scenarios. Comprehensive performance evaluations demonstrate that DSC-Diffuser generates realistic, stable, and generalizable policies, providing flexibility and reliable safety assurance in complex multi-task driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Certainty-Equivalence Model Predictive Control: Stability, Performance, and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling model mismatch is a common challenge in model-based controller design, particularly in model predictive control (MPC). While robust MPC is effective in managing uncertainties, its conservatism often makes it less desirable in practice. Certainty-equivalence MPC (CE-MPC), which relies on a nominal model, offers an appealing alternative due to its design simplicity and low computational requirements. Contrary to the existing analyses where MPC has access to the true model, this paper investigates CE-MPC for uncertain nonlinear systems with input constraints and parametric uncertainty. The primary contributions of the paper are two-fold. First, a novel perturbation analysis of the MPC value function is provided, without relying on the common assumption of Lipschitz continuity of the stage cost, better tailoring the popular quadratic cost and having broader applicability to value function approximation, online model learning in MPC, and performance-driven MPC design. Second, the stability and performance analysis of CE-MPC are provided, with a quantification of the suboptimality of CE-MPC compared to the infinite-horizon optimal controller with perfect model knowledge. The results provide valuable insights in how the prediction horizon and model mismatch jointly affect stability and performance. Furthermore, the general results are specialized to linear quadratic control, and a competitive ratio bound is derived, serving as the first competitive-ratio bound for MPC of uncertain linear systems with input constraints and multiplicative uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Evaluation of Quadratic Programs for Constrained Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic analysis of systems with affine input and polynomial state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide exact and terminating algorithms for the formal analysis of deterministic continuous-time control systems with affine input and polynomial state dynamics (in short, polynomial systems). We consider the following semantic properties: zeroness and equivalence, input independence, linearity, and analyticity. Our approach is based on Chen-Fliess series, which provide a unique representation of the dynamics of such systems via their formal generating series.
  Our starting point is Fliess' seminal work showing how the semantic properties above are mirrored by corresponding combinatorial properties on generating series. Next, we observe that the generating series of polynomial systems coincide with the class of shuffle-finite series, a nonlinear generalisation of Sch\"utzenberger's rational series which has recently been studied in the context of automata theory and enumerative combinatorics. We exploit and extend recent results in the algorithmic analysis of shuffle-finite series (such as zeroness, equivalence, and commutativity) to show that the semantic properties above can be decided exactly and in finite time for polynomial systems. Some of our analyses rely on a novel technical contribution, namely that shuffle-finite series are closed under support restrictions with commutative regular languages, a result of independent interest.</description>
