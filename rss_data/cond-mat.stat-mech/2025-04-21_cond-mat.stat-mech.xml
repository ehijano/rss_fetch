      <title>Ensemble Inequivalence in long range interacting spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble inequivalence occurs when a systems thermodynamic properties vary depending on the statistical ensemble used to describe it. This phenomenon is known to happen in systems with long-range interactions and has been observed in many classical systems. In this study, we provide a detailed analysis of a long-range quantum ferromagnet spin model that exhibits ensemble inequivalence. At zero temperature ($T = 0$), the microcanonical phase diagram matches that of the canonical ensemble. However, the two ensembles yield different phase diagrams at finite temperatures. This behavior contrasts with the conventional understanding in statistical mechanics of systems with short-range interactions, where thermodynamic properties are expected to align across different ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. We discuss the implications of these findings for synthetic quantum long-range platforms, such as atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy theorem distinguishing non-integrability and the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation for isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$. We prove a dichotomy theorem that a single relation sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system is non-integrable, or (ii) the lowest-order Yang-Baxter equation is satisfied. This result solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture stating that a model is integrable only if this model has a 3-local conserved quantity. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <title>Multifractional Brownian motion with telegraphic, stochastically varying exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diversity of diffusive systems exhibiting long-range correlations characterized by a stochastically varying Hurst exponent calls for a generic multifractional model. We present a simple, analytically tractable model which fills the gap between mathematical formulations of multifractional Brownian motion and empirical studies. In our model, called telegraphic multifractional Brownian motion, the Hurst exponent is modelled by a smoothed telegraph process which results in a stationary beta distribution of exponents as observed in biological experiments. We also provide a methodology to identify our model in experimental data and present concrete examples from biology, climate and finance to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology-Based Descriptor of Topological Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems with Application to Skyrmion Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particles systems, such as magnetic
  skyrmions, can exhibit a rich variety of topological phase transitions.
  However, the methodology for capturing the configurational properties of
  the lattice ordering and constructing an appropriate descriptor that can
  be easily calculated is not obvious. Here, we present a topological
  descriptor, "persistent diagram", and propose an indicator for
  topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers
  novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological
  features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The
  proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which
  selectively counts stable features in the persistence diagram,
  effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by
  comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering
  $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$, typically used
  to identify lattice phases. While our method is demonstrated in the
  context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be
  extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of repulsively
  interacting quasi-particles. Moreover, our indicator offers lower
  computational complexity than the conventionally used methods.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Distribution and Relaxation Dynamics Near the First-Order Transition Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model with Metropolis algorithm, we calculate the free energy in the whole phase boundary, particularly near the first phase transition line (1st-PTL).The results show that along the 1st-PTL, as the temperature decreases, the energy barrier between the two coexisting phases diverges. This results in more difficulty to reach the equilibrium, i.e., ultra-slow relaxation, which has been recently demonstrated. Meanwhile, we exam the randomness of the equilibrium time. It is found that near the 1st-PTL the equilibrium time is self-diverging, in contrast to the non-self-averaging near the critical point.</description>

      <title>Effect of presence of rigid impurities in a system of annihilating domain walls with dynamic bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of interacting domain walls, regarded as a system of particles which are biased to move towards their nearest neighbours and annihilate when they meet, have been studied in the recent past. We study the effect of the presence of a fraction $r$ of quenched impurities (which act as rigid walkers) on the dynamics. Here, in case two domain walls or one impurity and one domain wall happen to be on the same site, both get simultaneously annihilated. It is found that for any non-zero value of $r$, the dynamical behaviour changes as the surviving fraction of particles $\rho(t)$ attains a constant value. $\rho(t)t^\alpha $ shows a universal behaviour when plotted against $r^\beta t$ with $\alpha, \beta$ values depending on whether the particles are rigid or nonrigid. Also, the values differ for the biased and unbiased cases. The time scale associated with the particle decay obtained in several ways shows that it varies with $r$ in a power law manner with a universal exponent.</description>

      <title>Ordering and association of patchy particles in narrow channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the formalism of Wertheim's first order thermodynamic perturbation theory can be generalised for the fluid of anisotropic sticky particles confined to a quasi-one-dimensional channel. Using the transfer matrix method, we prove that the theory is exact if the hard body interaction is additive, only the first neighbors interact and the particles can stick together only along the channel. We show that the most convenient treatment of association in narrow channels is to work in NPT ensemble, where all structural and thermodynamic quantities can be expressed as a function of pressure and fraction of sites unbonded.</description>

      <title>Tracer dynamics in an interacting active bath: fluctuations and energy partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a massive tracer particle coupled to an interacting active bath, modeled as a harmonic chain of overdamped active particles analytically, with an aim to understand the impact of bath interactions and activity on the nonequilibrium fluctuations of the tracer. From the microscopic equations, we derive the tracer particle's effective Langevin equation, obtaining the dissipative and stochastic forces from the bath. We analyze the friction kernel, revealing power-law tails in the weak coupling limit and exponential decay in the strong coupling regime. Due to the interplay between bath interactions, probe-bath coupling, and activity, the mean squared displacement, velocity, and stationary velocity correlations exhibit different dynamical regimes, which we characterize analytically. Under harmonic confinement, we find that energy equipartition holds at low activity but breaks down at higher activity, with the kinetic energy exhibiting a non-monotonic dependence on the activity of the bath.</description>

      <title>Average Spread Complexity and the Higher-Order Level Spacing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spread complexity of a generic two-level subsystem of a larger system to analyze the influence of energy level statistics, comparing chaotic and integrable systems. Initially focusing on the nearest-neighbor level spacing, we observe the characteristic slope-dip-ramp-plateau structure. Further investigation reveals that certain matrix models exhibit additional iterative peaks, motivating us to generalize the known spacing distributions to higher-order level spacings. While this structure persists in chaotic systems, we find that integrable systems can also display similar features, highlighting limitations in using complexity as a universal diagnostic of quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after an inhomogeneous quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium time evolution of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy (SREE) following an inhomogeneous quench in a critical one-dimensional free fermion system. Using conformal field theory, we derive an exact expression for the SREE and analyze its behavior. We find that, at leading order in the long-time limit, the SREE grows logarithmically as $\log t$. While the equipartition of entanglement holds at leading order, we identify subleading corrections that break it. Our numerical simulations corroborate the analytical predictions with excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Page curve like dynamics in Interacting Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement in a one-dimensional $XXZ$ spin-$1/2$ chain, with and without integrability-breaking interactions, that is connected to a bath. We start from a state where the system and bath are completely unentangled, and the bath is polarized spin-down. We consider two different initial states for the system - (i) a polarized spin-up state, and (ii) an infinite temperature state. In the particle representation of the spin chain, the polarized spin-up state corresponds to a filled state, while the polarized spin-down state corresponds to an empty state. Starting from these inhomogeneous quenches, in all the above-mentioned cases we obtain the Page curve like behavior in the entanglement. We report different power-law behavior in the growth of entanglement for different initial states and different kinds of baths (interacting and non-interacting). In an attempt to explore plausible deep connections between entanglement and Boltzmann entropy, we investigate the latter in both the filled and the infinite temperature case, for the system and the bath. For the filled case, the Boltzmann entropy of the system has the form of a Page curve but quantitatively deviates from the entanglement. On the other hand, the entropy of the bath keeps increasing. Remarkably, for the infinite temperature case, we find that the system and bath Boltzmann entropies agree with the entanglement entropy, after and before the Page time, respectively. Our findings are expected to hold for generic interacting quantum systems and could be of relevance to black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Path sampling challenges in large biomolecular systems: RETIS and REPPTIS for ABL-imatinib kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the kinetics of drug-protein interactions is crucial for understanding drug efficacy, particularly in personalized medicine, where protein mutations can significantly alter drug residence times. This study applies Replica Exchange Transition Interface Sampling (RETIS) and its Partial Path variant (REPPTIS) to investigate the dissociation kinetics of imatinib from Abelson nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (ABL) and mutants relevant to chronic myeloid leukemia therapy. These path-sampling methods offer a bias-free alternative to conventional approaches requiring qualitative predefined reaction coordinates. Nevertheless, the complex free-energy landscape of ABL-imatinib dissociation presents significant challenges. Multiple metastable states and orthogonal barriers lead to parallel unbinding pathways, complicating convergence in TIS-based methods. Despite employing computational efficiency strategies such as asynchronous replica exchange, full convergence remained elusive. This work provides a critical assessment of path sampling in high-dimensional biological systems, discussing the need for enhanced initialization strategies, advanced Monte Carlo path generation moves, and machine learning-derived reaction coordinates to improve kinetic predictions of drug dissociation with minimal prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Production Principle of Thermodynamics for the Birth and Evolution of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the birth and evolution of life are reviewed with reference to the maximum entropy production principle (MEPP). It has been shown that this principle is essential for consistent understanding of the birth and evolution of life. First, a recent work for the birth of a self-replicative system as pre-RNA life is reviewed in relation to the MEPP. A critical condition of polymer concentration in a local system is reported by a dynamical system approach, above which, an exponential increase of entropy production is guaranteed. Secondly, research works of early stage of evolutions are reviewed; experimental research for the numbers of cells necessary for forming a multi-cellular organization, and numerical research of differentiation of a model system and its relation with MEPP. It is suggested by this review article that the late stage of evolution is characterized by formation of society and external entropy production. A hypothesis on the general route of evolution is discussed from the birth to the present life which follows the MEPP. Some examples of life which happened to face poor thermodynamic condition are presented with thermodynamic discussion. It is observed through this review that MEPP is consistently useful for thermodynamic understanding of birth and evolution of life, subject to a thermodynamic condition far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fickian Yet non-Gaussian Diffusion in Complex Molecular Fluids via a non-local diffusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fickian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (FnGD) has gained popularity in the recent times owing to it's ubiquity in a variety of complex fluids. However, whether FnGD can be observed experimentally in molecular fuids is still obscure with very little study in real systems. In this letter, we show existence of FnGD in molecular fluids based on compelling evidence from incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (IQENS). Using a cage-jump diffsion model, we show that while the approach to Fickianity is exponentially fast, the Gaussianity is restored at a much slower algebraic rate. We propose a non-local diffusion (NLD) model to describe a d-dimensional jump-diffusion in FnGD regime and show their universal applicability in such systems. This study establishes that cage-jump diffusion process inevitably lead to FnGD and provides the framework of NLD models to explore such diffusion phenomena in any arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Interacting Copies of Random Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of $y=2$ coupled copies of a well-known constraint satisfaction problem (random hypergraph bicoloring) to examine how the ferromagnetic coupling between the copies affects the properties of the solution space. We solve the replicated model by applying the cavity method to the supervariables taking $2^y$ values. Our results show that a coupling of strength $\gamma$ between the copies decreases the clustering threshold $\alpha_d(\gamma)$, at which typical solutions shatters into disconnected components, therefore preventing numerical methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains from reaching equilibrium in polynomial time. This result needs to be reconciled with the observation that, in models with coupled copies, denser regions of the solution space should be more accessible. Additionally, we observe a change in the nature of the clustering phase transition, from discontinuous to continuous, in a wide $\gamma$ range. We investigate how the coupling affects the behavior of the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm on finite-size instances and find that BP convergence is significantly impacted by the continuous transition. These results highlight the importance of better understanding algorithmic performance at the clustering transition, and call for a further exploration into the optimal use of re-weighting strategies designed to enhance algorithmic performances.</description>

      <title>Extended mean-field theories for networks of real neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the behavior of a system with many degrees of freedom can be captured by a small number of collective variables, then plausibly there is an underlying mean-field theory. We show that simple versions of this idea fail to describe the patterns of activity in networks of real neurons. An extended mean-field theory that matches the distribution of collective variables is at least consistent, though shows signs that these networks are poised near a critical point, in agreement with other observations. These results suggest a path to analysis of emerging data on ever larger numbers of neurons.</description>

      <title>Fine features of entanglement dynamics in quenches across the Ising quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding important aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields, we present numerical observations of several "fine-grained" features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics, induced by quantum quenches across the Ising critical point, from a quantum informational point of view that have hitherto escaped notice. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for sufficiently big subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atoms in a Ladder Geometry: Quench Dynamics and Floquet Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent days, Rydberg atom quantum simulator platforms have emerged as novel quantum simulators for physical systems ranging from condensed matter to particle physics. On a fundamental level, these platforms allow for a direct test of our understanding of the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics starting from the laws of quantum dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the fate of quantum dynamics in a model of Rydberg atoms arranged in a square ladder geometry, with a Rabi frequency $2\Omega$ and a detuning profile which is staggered along the longer direction with amplitude $\Delta$. As the staggering strength $\Delta$ is tuned from $\Delta/\Omega=0\rightarrow\infty$, the model exhibits a wide class of dynamical phenomena, ranging from (i) quantum many-body scars (QMBS) ($\Delta/\Omega \sim 0,1$), (ii) integrability induced slow dynamics and approximate Krylov fractures ($\Delta/\Omega \gg 1$) . Additionally, by leveraging the underlying chiral nature of the spectrum of this model Hamiltonian, it is possible to design Floquet protocols leading to dynamical signatures reminiscent of discrete time-crystalline order and exact Floquet flat bands. Finally, we study the robustness of these dynamical features against imperfections in the implementation of the Floquet protocols, long-range van der Waals interactions and inevitable influences from the environment in the form of pure dephasing and the finite lifetime of the Rydberg excited state.</description>

      <title>Effective single particle theory for active particles using local density fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the dynamic non-equilibrium steady state behavior of active particles using density fluctuations in the system. We analyze the effective local density around a particle in the steady state and numerically calculate its mean, variance and autocorrelation. Thus, using local density and its statistical properties as a temporally correlated stochastic variable, we develop an effective single-particle theoretical model and analytically derive an expression for the particle's diffusivity as a function of the global packing density in the system. Our theory accurately predicts the transport properties of an active particle, validated against numerical simulations. Unlike mean-field theory, which fails at high packing densities due to significant density fluctuations from dynamic cluster formation, our model remains effective across all densities. It also captures the well-known phase transition beyond a critical packing density. The key novelty of our model lies in the introduction of a stochastic local density field, which encapsulates the effect of steric interactions on an active particle and helps predict single-particle behavior in a collection, a feature often absent in standard active matter models. This approach could be useful in experimental setups where fluctuations in local density around a tagged particle are measurable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time non-locality, or memory, is a non-equilibrium property shared by all physical systems. Here, we show that memory is sufficient to induce a phase of spatial long-range order (LRO) even if the system's primary dynamical variables are coupled locally. This occurs when the memory degrees of freedom have slower dynamics than the primary degrees of freedom. In addition, such an LRO phase is non-perturbative, and can be understood through the lens of a correlated percolation transition of the fast degrees of freedom mediated by memory. When the two degrees of freedom have comparable time scales, the length of the effective long-range interaction shortens. We exemplify this behavior with a model of locally coupled spins and a single dynamic memory variable, but our analysis is sufficiently general to suggest that memory could induce a phase of LRO in a much wider variety of physical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that the nonequilibrium dynamics of most pure states gives rise to the same entropy production as that of the corresponding ensemble, provided the effective dimension of the ensemble is large enough. This establishes the positivity of entropy production under a wide variety of nonequilibrium situations. Our results follow from dynamical typicality and suitable continuity properties alone, without relying on non-integrability, and they complement other recent efforts to establish "pure state second laws". An explicit comparison with the distinctively different two-point measurement scheme is also provided.</description>

Abstract: We explore the dynamics of two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode optical cavity, employing nonequilibrium diagrammatic techniques to capture nonlinearities and fluctuations beyond mean-field theory. We discover a novel prethermalization regime driven by the interplay between short-range Rydberg interactions and long-range photon-mediated interactions. In this regime, matter and light equilibrate at distinct - and in some cases opposite - effective temperatures, resembling the original concept of prethermalization from particle physics. Our results establish strongly correlated AMO platforms as tools to investigate fundamental questions in statistical mechanics, including quantum thermalization in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Bounds for the Restricted Solid-on-Solid Model of Surface Growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) model is a model of continuous-time surface growth characterized by the constraint that adjacent height differences are bounded by a fixed constant. Though the model is conjectured to belong to the KPZ universality class, mathematical progress on the model is very sparse. We study basic properties of the model and establish bounds on surface height fluctuations as a function of time. A linear fluctuation bound is proven for all dimensions, and a logarithmic fluctuation lower bound is given for dimension one. The proofs rely on a new characterization of RSOS as a type of first passage percolation on a disordered lattice, which is of independent interest. The logarithmic lower bound is established by showing equality in distribution to the minimum of a certain dual RSOS process.</description>

      <title>Universal term of Entanglement Entropy in the $\pi$-flux Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researchers in physical science aim to uncover universal features in strongly interacting many-body systems, often hidden in complicated observables like entanglement entropy (EE). The non-local nature of EE makes it challenging to compute numerically, necessitating the development of an unbiased and convenient algorithm. In this paper, we use quantum Monte Carlo to reveal that the coefficient of variation in direct EE calculations increases exponentially with system size, leading to inaccuracies. To address this issue, we develop a power incremental algorithm and a technique for straightforwardly calculating the universal term of EE, successfully evaluating the EE of a 2D Hubbard model. Our numerical results demonstrate the consistency of the universal coefficient of EE from sharp corners at the Gross-Neveu quantum critical point and for free Dirac fermions. Our method can also be applied to other unstable observables, such as partition functions, entanglement spectra, and negativity, thereby fostering computational and theoretical progress.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Geometry of Entanglement in Many-Body Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new framework is formulated to study entanglement dynamics in many-body quantum systems along with an associated geometric description. In this formulation, called the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF), the system's wave function or density matrix is transformed into a new space of complex functions with isolated singularities. Accordingly, entanglement dynamics is encoded in specific residues of the QCTF, and importantly, the explicit evaluation of the system's time dependence is avoided. Notably, the QCTF formulation allows for various algebraic simplifications and approximations to address the normally encountered complications due to the exponential growth of the many-body Hilbert space with the number of bodies. These simplifications are facilitated through considering the \textit{patterns}, in lieu of the elements, lying within the system's state. Consequently, a main finding of this paper is the exterior (Grassmannian) algebraic expression of many-body entanglement as the collective areas of regions in the Hilbert space spanned by pairs of projections of the wave function onto an arbitrary basis. This latter geometric measure is shown to be equivalent to the second-order R\'enyi entropy. Additionally, the geometric description of the QCTF shows that characterizing features of the reduced density matrix can be related to experimentally observable quantities. The QCTF-based geometric description offers the prospect of theoretically revealing aspects of many-body entanglement, by drawing on the vast scope of methods from geometry.</description>

Abstract: The exact single-magnon entanglement evolution in Heisenberg chains is obtained using the Quantum Correlation Transfer Function (QCTF) formulation. A dual, i.e., frequency and time-domain, analysis shows that the transient dynamics of individual spins' entanglement is described via a Bessel function of the first kind. Through QCTF, we bypass the evaluation of the full system's state for the purpose of obtaining entanglement. Although it is known that the observable entanglement edge is formed by the arrival of a stream of quasi-particles that travel with the maximum group velocity, we show how the early quasi-particles travel faster than the maximum group velocity of the chain and contribute to entanglement production. Our results can be extended to the multi-magnon regime, therefore opening up the means to better interpret equilibration dynamics and thermodynamics in Heisenberg chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the linear transport of neutral system within the framework of relativistic kinetic theory. Under the relaxation time approximation, we obtain an iterative solution to the relativistic Boltzmann equation in generic stationary spacetime. This solution provides a scheme to study non-equilibrium system order by order. Our calculations are performed in generic hydrodynamic frame, and the results can be reduced to a specific hydrodynamic frame by imposing constraints. As a specific example, we analytically calculated the covariant expressions of the particle flow and the energy momentum tensor up to the first order in relaxation time. Finally and most importantly, we present all 14 kinetic coefficients for a neutral system, which are verified to satisfy the Onsager reciprocal relation in a generic hydrodynamic frame and guarantee a non-negative entropy production in the frame where the first order conservation laws are restored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10562v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A black hole evaporates by Hawking radiation. Each mode of that radiation is thermal. If the total state is nevertheless to be pure, modes must be entangled. Estimating the minimum size of this entanglement has been an important outstanding issue. We develop a new theory of constrained random symplectic transformations, based on that the total state is pure and Gaussian with given marginals. In the random constrained symplectic model we then compute the distribution of mode-mode correlations, from which we bound mode-mode entanglement. Modes of frequency much larger than $\frac{k_B T_{H}(t)}{\hbar}$ are not populated at time $t$ and drop out of the analysis. Among the other modes we find that correlations and hence entanglement between relatively thinly populated modes (early-time high-frequency modes and/or late modes of any frequency) to be strongly suppressed. Relatively highly populated modes (early-time low-frequency modes) can on the other hand be strongly correlated, but a detailed analysis reveals that they are nevertheless very unlikely to be entangled. Our analysis hence establishes that restoring unitarity after a complete evaporation of a black hole does not require any significant quantum entanglement between any pair of Hawking modes. Our analysis further gives exact general expressions for the distribution of mode-mode correlations in random, pure, Gaussian states with given marginals, which may have applications beyond black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is the minimal time until a quantum system can exhibit genuine quantum features? To answer this question we derive quantum speed limits for two-time correlation functions arising from statistics of measurements. Generally, these two-time correlators are described by quasiprobabilities, if the initial quantum state of the system does not commute with the measurement observables. Our quantum speed limits are derived from the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation, and set the minimal time at which a quasiprobability can become non-positive, which is evidence for the onset of non-classical traits in the system dynamics. As an illustrative example, we apply these results to a conditional quantum gate, by determining the optimal condition giving rise to non-classicality at maximum speed. Our analysis also hints at boosted power extraction in genuinely non-classical dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy (SRE) to characterize a quantum phase transition that has so far eluded any standard description and can thus now be explained in terms of the interplay between its non-stabilizer properties and entanglement. The transition under consideration separates a region with a unique ground state from one with a degenerate ground state manifold spanned by states with finite and opposite (intensive) momenta. We show that SRE has a jump at the crossing points, while the entanglement entropy remains continuous. Moreover, by leveraging on a Clifford circuit mapping, we connect the observed jump in SRE to that occurring between standard and generalized $W$-states with finite momenta. This mapping allows us to quantify the SRE discontinuity analytically.</description>

Abstract: Surfacic networks are structures built upon a two-dimensional manifold. Many systems, including transportation networks and various urban networks, fall into this category. The fluctuations of node elevations imply significant deviations from typical plane networks and require specific tools to understand their impact. Here, we present such tools, including lazy paths that minimize elevation differences, graph arduousness which measures the tiring nature of shortest paths, and the excess effort, which characterizes positive elevation variations along shortest paths. We illustrate these measures using toy models of surfacic networks and empirically examine pedestrian networks in selected cities. Specifically, we examine how changes in elevation affect the spatial distribution of betweenness centrality. We also demonstrate that the excess effort follows a non-trivial power law distribution, with an exponent that is not universal, which illustrates that there is a significant probability of encountering steep slopes along shortest paths, regardless of the elevation difference between the starting point and the destination. These findings highlight the significance of elevation fluctuations in shaping network characteristics. Surfacic networks offer a promising framework for comprehensively analyzing and modeling complex systems that are situated on or constrained to a surface environment.</description>
