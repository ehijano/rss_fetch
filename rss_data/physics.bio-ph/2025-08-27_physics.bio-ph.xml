      <title>Single-molecule biophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological molecules, like all active matter, use free energy to generate force and motion which drive them out of thermal equilibrium, and undergo inherent dynamic interconversion between metastable free energy states separated by levels barely higher than stochastic thermal energy fluctuations. Here, we explore the founding and emerging approaches of the field of single-molecule biophysics which, unlike traditional ensemble average approaches, enable the detection and manipulation of individual molecules and facilitate exploration of biomolecular heterogeneity and its impact on transitional molecular kinetics and underpinning molecular interactions. We discuss the ground-breaking technological innovations which scratch far beyond the surface into open questions of real physiology, that correlate orthogonal data types and interplay empirical measurement with theoretical and computational insights, many of which are enabling artificial matter to be designed inspired by biological systems. And finally, we examine how these insights are helping to develop new physics framed around biology.</description>

      <title>Testing a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer for Earth Observations on the HEIMDAL Stratospheric Balloon Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stratospheric High Altitude Balloons (HABs) have great potential as a remote sensing platform for Earth Observations that complements orbiting satellites and low flying drones. At altitudes between 20-35 kms, HABs operate significantly closer to ground than orbiting satellites, but significantly higher than most drones. HABs therefore offer a unique potential to deliver high spatial resolution imaging with large area coverage. Another two imaging parameters that are important for Earth Observation applications are spectral resolution and spectral range. In this paper, we therefore present the development and testing of a hyperspectral imaging system, able to record near-video-rate images in narrow contiguous spectral bands, from a HAB platform. In particular, we present the first stratospheric environmental tests and HAB flight of a snapshot hyperspectral camera, based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS), which is well suited to cope with the challenges posed by the motion of the HAB platform and the stratospheric environment. We have successfully acquired images with the system under both simulated stratospheric conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory at Aarhus University and during a 5 hour HAB flight mission named HEIMDAL from Kiruna in October 2024 as part of the REXUS/BEXUS 34/35 2024 campaign organized by DLR-SNSA. The study represents a step towards deploying the HAB platform for high quality land cover classification.</description>

      <title>Chemotaxing E. coli do not count single molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organisms use specialized sensors to measure their environments, but the fundamental principles that determine their accuracy remain largely unknown. In Escherichia coli chemotaxis, we previously found that gradient-climbing speed is bounded by the amount of information that cells acquire from their environment, and that E. coli operate near this bound. However, it remains unclear what prevents them from acquiring more information. Past work argued that E. coli's chemosensing is limited by the physics of molecules stochastically arriving at cells' receptors, without direct evidence. Here, we show instead that E. coli are far from this physical limit. To show this, we develop a theoretical approach that uses information rates to quantify how accurately behaviorally-relevant signals can be estimated from available observations: molecule arrivals for the physical limit; chemotaxis signaling activity for E. coli. Measuring these information rates in single-cell experiments across multiple background concentrations, we find that E. coli encode two orders of magnitude less information than the physical limit. Thus, E. coli chemosensing is limited by internal noise in signal processing rather than the physics of molecule diffusion, motivating investigation of what specific physical and biological constraints shaped the evolution of this prototypical sensory system.</description>

      <title>Protein Drift-Diffusion in Membranes with Non-equilibrium Fluctuations arising from Gradients in Concentration or Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.</description>
