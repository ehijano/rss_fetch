      <title>MarketSenseAI 2.0: Enhancing Stock Analysis through LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&amp;P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&amp;P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Floating exercise boundaries for American options in time-inhomogeneous models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines a semi-analytical approach for pricing American options in time-inhomogeneous models characterized by negative interest rates (for equity, FX) or negative convenience yields (for commodities, cryptocurrencies). Under such conditions, exercise boundaries may exhibit a "floating" structure - dynamically appearing and disappearing. For example, a second exercise boundary could emerge within the computational domain and subsequently both could collapse, demanding specialized pricing methodologies.</description>

      <title>Decision-informed Neural Networks with Large Language Model Integration for Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the critical disconnect between prediction and decision quality in portfolio optimization by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with decision-focused learning. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that minimizing the prediction error alone leads to suboptimal portfolio decisions. We aim to exploit the representational power of LLMs for investment decisions. An attention mechanism processes asset relationships, temporal dependencies, and macro variables, which are then directly integrated into a portfolio optimization layer. This enables the model to capture complex market dynamics and align predictions with the decision objectives. Extensive experiments on S\&amp;P100 and DOW30 datasets show that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. In addition, gradient-based analyses show that our model prioritizes the assets most crucial to decision making, thus mitigating the effects of prediction errors on portfolio performance. These findings underscore the value of integrating decision objectives into predictions for more robust and context-aware portfolio management.</description>

      <title>Supervised Similarity for High-Yield Corporate Bonds with Quantum Cognition Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of quantum cognition machine learning (QCML), a novel paradigm for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks rooted in the mathematical formalism of quantum theory, to distance metric learning in corporate bond markets. Compared to equities, corporate bonds are relatively illiquid and both trade and quote data in these securities are relatively sparse. Thus, a measure of distance/similarity among corporate bonds is particularly useful for a variety of practical applications in the trading of illiquid bonds, including the identification of similar tradable alternatives, pricing securities with relatively few recent quotes or trades, and explaining the predictions and performance of ML models based on their training data. Previous research has explored supervised similarity learning based on classical tree-based models in this context; here, we explore the application of the QCML paradigm for supervised distance metric learning in the same context, showing that it outperforms classical tree-based models in high-yield (HY) markets, while giving comparable or better performance (depending on the evaluation metric) in investment grade (IG) markets.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT and Corporate Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We create a firm-level ChatGPT investment score, based on conference calls, that measures managers' anticipated changes in capital expenditures. We validate the score with interpretable textual content and its strong correlation with CFO survey responses. The investment score predicts future capital expenditure for up to nine quarters, controlling for Tobin's $q$ and other determinants, implying the investment score provides incremental information about firms' future investment opportunities. The investment score also separately forecasts future total, intangible, and R\&amp;D investments. Consistent with theoretical predictions, high-investment-score firms experience significant positive short-term returns upon disclosure, and negative long-run future abnormal returns. We demonstrate ChatGPT's applicability to measure other policies, such as dividends and employment.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Generative AI for Economic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03897v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use generative AI to extract managerial expectations about their economic outlook from over 120,000 corporate conference call transcripts. The overall measure, AI Economy Score, robustly predicts future economic indicators such as GDP growth, production, and employment, both in the short term and to 10 quarters. This predictive power is incremental to that of existing measures, including survey forecasts. Moreover, industry and firm-level measures provide valuable information about sector-specific and individual firm activities. Our findings suggest that managerial expectations carry unique insights about economic activities, with implications for both macroeconomic and microeconomic decision-making.</description>

      <title>Beyond Monte Carlo: Harnessing Diffusion Models to Simulate Financial Market Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a highly efficient and accurate methodology for generating synthetic financial market data using a diffusion model approach. The synthetic data produced by our methodology align closely with observed market data in several key aspects: (i) they pass the two-sample Cramer - von Mises test for portfolios of assets, and (ii) Q - Q plots demonstrate consistency across quantiles, including in the tails, between observed and generated market data. Moreover, the covariance matrices derived from a large set of synthetic market data exhibit significantly lower condition numbers compared to the estimated covariance matrices of the observed data. This property makes them suitable for use as regularized versions of the latter. For model training, we develop an efficient and fast algorithm based on numerical integration rather than Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is tested on a large set of equity data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks with Amplitude Encoding: Advancing Recovery Rate Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recovery rate prediction plays a pivotal role in bond investment strategies, enhancing risk assessment, optimizing portfolio allocation, improving pricing accuracy, and supporting effective credit risk management. However, forecasting faces challenges like high-dimensional features, small sample sizes, and overfitting. We propose a hybrid Quantum Machine Learning model incorporating Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC) within a neural network framework. PQCs inherently preserve unitarity, avoiding computationally costly orthogonality constraints, while amplitude encoding enables exponential data compression, reducing qubit requirements logarithmically. Applied to a global dataset of 1,725 observations (1996-2023), our method achieved superior accuracy (RMSE 0.228) compared to classical neural networks (0.246) and quantum models with angle encoding (0.242), with efficient computation times. This work highlights the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures in advancing recovery rate forecasting.</description>

      <title>Global Public Sentiment on Decentralized Finance: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Geo-tagged Tweets from 150 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blockchain technology and decentralized finance (DeFi) are reshaping global financial systems. Despite their impact, the spatial distribution of public sentiment and its economic and geopolitical determinants are often overlooked. This study analyzes over 150 million geo-tagged, DeFi-related tweets from 2012 to 2022, sourced from a larger dataset of 7.4 billion tweets. Using sentiment scores from a BERT-based multilingual classification model, we integrated these tweets with economic and geopolitical data to create a multimodal dataset. Employing techniques like sentiment analysis, spatial econometrics, clustering, and topic modeling, we uncovered significant global variations in DeFi engagement and sentiment. Our findings indicate that economic development significantly influences DeFi engagement, particularly after 2015. Geographically weighted regression analysis revealed GDP per capita as a key predictor of DeFi tweet proportions, with its impact growing following major increases in cryptocurrency values such as bitcoin. While wealthier nations are more actively engaged in DeFi discourse, the lowest-income countries often discuss DeFi in terms of financial security and sudden wealth. Conversely, middle-income countries relate DeFi to social and religious themes, whereas high-income countries view it mainly as a speculative instrument or entertainment. This research advances interdisciplinary studies in computational social science and finance and supports open science by making our dataset and code available on GitHub, and providing a non-code workflow on the KNIME platform. These contributions enable a broad range of scholars to explore DeFi adoption and sentiment, aiding policymakers, regulators, and developers in promoting financial inclusion and responsible DeFi engagement globally.</description>
