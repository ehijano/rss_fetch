      <title>A new mass estimate method with hydrodynamical atmospheres for very massive WNh stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very massive stars with masses over 100 Msun are key objects in the Universe for our understanding of chemical and energetic feedback in the Universe, but their evolution and fate are almost entirely determined by their wind mass loss. We aim to determine the mass of the most massive star known in the Local Group R136a1. For this we compute the first hydrodynamically consistent non-local thermodynamical equilibrium atmosphere models for both R136a1 (WN5h) as well as the binary system R144 (WN5/6h+WN6/7h) in the Tarantula nebula. Using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet code, we simultaneously empirically derive and theoretically predict mass-loss rates and wind velocities. By fitting synthetic spectra derived from these models to multi-wavelength observations, we constrain the stellar and wind properties of R144 and R136a1. We first determine the clumping stratification required by our hydro-models to fit the spectra of R144 by using the available dynamical mass estimates for the two components. We then utilise this clumping stratification in hydrodynamic models of R136a1 and estimate a mass of $M_\mathrm{Hydro}$ of 233 Msun. Remarkably, the estimated mass is close to and entirely consistent with chemical homogeneous mass relations. This present-day mass of 233 Msun provides a lower limit to the initial stellar mass, that could be far higher due to previous wind mass loss.</description>

      <title>Bo\v{s}kovi\'c's method for determining the axis and rate of solar rotation by observing sunspots in 1777</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1777 Ru{\dj}er Bo\v{s}kovi\'c observed sunspots, determined their positions and the solar rotation elements by his own methods briefly described here. We repeat his calculations of the mean solar time, sunspot positions, and solar rotation elements using both the Bo\v{s}kovi\'c's original equations and equations adapted for modern computers. We repeat the calculations using two values of the obliquity of the ecliptic, Bo\v{s}kovi\'c's, and an interpolated one. Using his 1777 observations, Bo\v{s}kovi\'c obtained the solar equator's inclination, ecliptic longitude of the ascending node, and sidereal and synodic rotation periods. We analyzed and compared these original Bo\v{s}kovi\'c results with our repeated calculations. Our results confirm the validity of Bo\v{s}kovi\'c's methods and the precision of his calculations. Additionally, the paper presents the solar differential rotation determination using all 1777 observations by Ru{\dj}er Bo\v{s}kovi\'c.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the Relationships between Solar Flares and Source Active Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares are defined as outbursts on the surface of the Sun. They occur when energy accumulated in magnetic fields enclosing solar active regions (ARs) is abruptly expelled. Solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections are sources of space weather that adversely impact devices at or near Earth, including the obstruction of high-frequency radio waves utilized for communication and the deterioration of power grid operations. Tracking and delivering early and precise predictions of solar flares is essential for readiness and catastrophe risk mitigation. This paper employs the random forest (RF) model to address the binary classification task, analyzing the links between solar flares and their originating ARs with observational data gathered from 2011 to 2021 by SolarMonitor.org and the XRT flare database. We seek to identify the physical features of a source AR that significantly influence its potential to trigger &gt;=C-class flares. We found that the features of AR_Type_Today, Hale_Class_Yesterday are the most and the least prepotent features, respectively. NoS_Difference has a remarkable effect in decision-making in both global and local interpretations.</description>

      <title>Electron Beam Propagation and Radio-Wave Scattering in the Inner Heliosphere using Five Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particles such as electrons can be accelerated to mildly-relativistic velocities in the solar corona. These electrons travel through the turbulent corona generating radio waves, which are then severely affected by scattering. The physical interpretation of the discrepancies between the actual and observed radio sources is still subject to debate. Here, we use radio emission observed by an unprecedented total of five spacecraft, to track the path of radio sources from the low corona to the inner heliosphere (15-75 R$_{\odot}$) generated during a solar event on 4 December 2021. In this study we use the Bayesian multilateration technique known as BELLA to track the apparent path of radio sources observed by Parker Solar Probe, STEREO A, Wind, Solar Orbiter and Mars Express. To validate the accuracy of the tracked path, we used Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph interferometric imaging at 150 MHz, which was found to agree with the estimated footpoints predicted by BELLA. We also further validated our results using ACE in-situ measurements. We found that the apparent radio sources followed the path of a Parker Spiral, with an associated solar wind velocity of approximately 493 km s-1 (consistent with the corresponding speed observed at 1 au at the relevant longitude) and connected to 75$^\circ$ longitude East at the solar surface. Finally, we made quantitative estimates of the scattering of radio waves that were found to be in good agreement with contemporary models of scattering. This work shows conclusive evidence that the disputed cause of the widely observed `higher than expected' electron densities at interplanetary distances is due to radio wave scattering, and provides a more detailed understanding of the propagation of radio waves emitted near the local plasma frequency in turbulent plasmas.</description>

      <title>Gas infall via accretion disk feeding Cepheus A HW2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star-forming region Cepheus A hosts a very young star, called HW2, that is the second closest to us growing a dozen times more massive than our Sun. The circumstellar environment surrounding HW2 has long been the subject of much debate about the presence or not of an accretion disk, whose existence is at the basis of our current paradigm of star formation. Here, we answer this long standing question by resolving the gaseous disk component, and its kinematics, through sensitive observations at cm wavelengths of hot ammonia (NH$_3$) with the Jansky Very Large Array. We map the accretion disk surrounding HW2 at radii between 200 and 700 au, showing how fast circumstellar gas collapses and slowly orbits to pile up near the young star at very high rates of $2\times10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. These results, corroborated by state-of-the-art simulations, show that an accretion disk is still efficient in focusing huge mass infall rates near the young star, even when this star has already reached a large mass of 16 M$_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>3D Simulations of Semiconvection in Spheres: Turbulent Mixing and Layer Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconvection occurs in regions of stars and planets that are unstable to overturning convection according to the Schwarzschild criterion, yet stable according to the Ledoux criterion. Previous simulations in Cartesian boxes have advanced our understanding of the semiconvective instability, layer formation, and transport properties. However, much less is known about semiconvection in spherical geometry and under the influence of rotation or magnetic fields. We present 3D simulations of semiconvection in the full sphere (including $r=0$), and accounting for rotation. We find that the formation and evolution of semiconvective layers in nonrotating spheres occurs in a similar way to nonrotating Cartesian boxes, in the sense that the critical density ratio at which layers are expected to form is approximately the same in both geometries. Layers rapidly merge once they form, ultimately leading to a fully mixed convective sphere. The transport properties measured through the Nusselt numbers and the buoyancy flux ratio are also similar to results from previous studies in boxes. When rotation is added to the system, layer formation and evolution proceeds in a similar fashion to the nonrotating runs. However, rotation hampers the radial transport of heat and composition, and, as a result, the time required for the sphere to become fully mixed gets longer as the flow becomes more rotationally constrained. We also find that semiconvective layers exhibit spherical mixing in nonrotating cases, whereas in rotating cases, the mixing becomes more cylindrical. We discuss what is needed for future work to build more realistic models.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Stellar Astronomy: Progress up to 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Activity of low mass stars in the light of spot signature in the Fourier domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Magnetic fields exhibit a wide variety of behaviours in low mass stars and further characterization is required to understand these observations. Stellar photometry from space missions such as MOST, CoRoT, Kepler, and, in future PLATO, provide thousands of highly precise light curves (LC) that can shed new light upon stellar activity, in particular through the signature of transiting spots. Aims. We study the impact of star spots on light curves in the Fourier domain, reducing the degeneracies encountered by direct spot modelling in the temporal domain, and use this new formulation to explore the spot properties from the available data. Methods. We propose a model of LC power spectra at low frequency based on a description of spot transits that allows us to retrieve information about the amplitude of their photometric impact $\mathcal{H}$, and about the spot mean lifetime over the observation $\tau_{\rm life}$ when the power spectrum exibits rotation peaks. We first validate this method with simulated LCs and then apply it to the Kepler data to extract global trends over a set of more than 37 755 stars. Results. This analysis leads to a classification of the sample into "peakless" or "with peaks" spectra, and enables the identification of different activity regimes based on $\mathcal{H}$ and $\tau_{\rm life}$ for different ranges of Rossby number. More specifically, we observe an intense regime of activity between Ro = 0.7 and Ro = 1, for stars with masses under 1$M_\odot$. Conclusions. This new systematic method can be used to provide new observational constraints on stellar activity (and possibly a link with stellar magnetism) when applied to large photometric datasets, such as those from the future PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>Forecasting and Analysis of Solar Energetic Particle Radiation Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Energetic Particle (SEPs) with energies ranging from tens of keV to a few GeV, are a significant component in the description of the space environment. In this work, the HESPERIA REleASE product is emphasized, which, based on the Relativistic Electron Alert System for Exploration (REleASE) forecasting scheme, generates real-time predictions of the proton flux (30-50 MeV) at L1, making use of relativistic and near-relativistic electron measurements by the SOHO/EPHIN and ACE/EPAM experiments, respectively. The HESPERIA REleASE Alert is a notification system based on the forecasts produced by the HESPERIA REleASE product and informs about the expected radiation impact in real-time using an illustration and a distribution system for registered users. We also present and discuss the Advance Warning Times derived for the compiled list of major SEP events successfully forecasted over the last 2.5 years dur-ing solar cycle 25 by HESPERIA REleASE and recent developments.</description>

      <title>A Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) XVIII. Reconstructing the star formation history of early-type galaxies through the combination of their UV and H$\alpha$ emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the SFHs of 7 massive ($M_{\star}\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$) early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the Virgo cluster by analysing their spatially resolved stellar population (SP), including their UV and H$\alpha$ emission. As part of the VESTIGE survey, we used H$\alpha$ images to select ETGs that show no signs of ongoing star formation. We combined VESTIGE with images from Astrosat/UVIT, GALEX and CFHT from the NGVS to analyse radial spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the FUV to the NIR. The UV emission in these galaxies is likely due to old, low mass stars in post main sequence (PMS) phases, the UV upturn. We fit the radial SEDs with novel SP models that include an old, hot stellar component of PMS stars with various temperatures and energetics. This way, we explore the main stellar parameters responsible for UV upturn stars irregardless of their evolutionary path. Standard models are not able to reproduce the galaxies' central FUV emission (SMA/$R_{eff}\lesssim1$), while the new models well characterise it through PMS stars with temperatures T$\gtrsim$25000 K. All galaxies are old (mass-weighted ages $\gtrsim10$ Gyr) and the most massive M49 and M87 are supersolar within SMA/$R_{\rm eff}\lesssim0.2$. Overall, we found flat age gradients ($\nabla$Log(Age)$\sim -0.04 - 0$ dex) and shallow metallicity gradients ($\nabla$Log(Z)$&lt;-0.2$ dex), except for M87 ($\nabla$Log($Z_{\rm M87}$)$\simeq-0.45$ dex). Our results show that these ETGs formed with timescales $\tau\lesssim1500$ Myr, having assembled between $\sim40-90\%$ of their stellar mass at $z\sim5$. This is consistent with recent JWST observations of quiescent massive galaxies at high$-z$, which are likely the ancestors of the largest ETGs in the nearby Universe. The derived flat/shallow gradients indicate that major mergers might have contributed to the formation and evolution of these galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Life and Times of Star-Forming Cores: an Analysis of Dense Gas in the STARFORGE Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense gas in molecular clouds is an important signature of ongoing and future star formation. We identify and track dense cores in the STARFORGE simulations, following the core evolution from birth through dispersal by stellar feedback for typical Milky Way cloud conditions. Only $\sim$8% of cores host protostars, and most disperse before forming stars. The median starless and protostellar core lifetimes are $\sim 0.5-0.6$ Myr and $\sim0.8-1.1$ Myr, respectively, where the protostellar phase lasts $\sim 0.1^{+0.1}_{-0.05}$ Myr. While core evolution is stochastic, we find that virial ratios and linewidths decline in prestellar cores, coincident with turbulent decay. Collapse occurs over $\sim 0.1$ Myr, once the central density exceeds $\gtrsim 10^6$cm$^{-3}$. Starless cores, only, follow linewidth-size and mass-size relations, $\sigma \propto R^{0.3}$ and $M \propto R^1$. The core median mass, radius, and velocity dispersion scale weakly with the cloud magnetic field strength. We cluster the core properties and find that protostellar cores have $&gt;80$% likelihood of belonging to three particular groups that are characterized by high central densities, compact radii, and lower virial parameters. Overall, core evolution appears to be universally set by the interplay of gravity and magnetized turbulence, while stellar feedback dictates protostellar core properties and sets the protostellar phase lifetime.</description>

      <title>Coping with loss: Stability of mass transfer from post-main sequence donor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12707v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stability of mass transfer is critical in determining pathways towards various kinds of compact binaries, such as compact main-sequence white-dwarf binaries, and transients, such as double white-dwarf mergers and luminous red novae. Despite its importance, only very few systematic studies of the stability of mass transfer exist. Using the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, we study the behaviour of mass-losing post-main-sequence donor stars with masses between $1 M_{\odot}$ and $8 M_{\odot}$ in binaries, without assuming that the donor star responds to mass loss adiabatically . We treat the accretor as a point mass, which we do not evolve, and assume the mass transfer is conservative. We find that the criterion that best predicts the onset of runaway mass transfer is based on the transition to an effectively adiabatic donor response to mass loss. We find that the critical mass ratio $q_{\rm qad} \sim 0.25$ for stars crossing the Hertzsprung gap, while for convective giants $q_{\rm qad}$ decreases from $\sim 1$ at the base of the RGB to $\sim 0.1$ at the the onset of thermal pulses on the AGB. An effectively adiabatic response of the donor star only occurs at a very high critical mass-transfer rate due to the short local thermal timescale in the outermost layers of a red giant. For $q &gt; q_{\rm qad}$ mass transfer is self-regulated, but for evolved giants the resulting mass-transfer rates can be so high that the evolution becomes dynamical and/or the donor can overflow its outer lobe. Our results indicate that mass transfer is stable for a wider range of binary parameter space than typically assumed in rapid binary population synthesis and found in recent similar studies. Moreover, we find a systematic dependence of the critical mass ratio on the donor star mass and radius which may have significant consequences for predictions of post-mass-transfer populations.</description>

Abstract: Turbulent small-scale structures in the envelopes and winds of massive stars have long been suggested as the cause for excessive line broadening that could not be explained by other mechanisms such as thermal broadening. However, the origin of these structures, particularly in the envelope, has not been extensively studied. We study the origin of structures seen in 2D unified stellar atmosphere and wind simulations of O stars and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Particularly, we study whether the structure growth in the simulations is consistent with sub-surface convection, as is commonly assumed to be the origin of this turbulence. Using a linear stability analysis of the optically thick envelopes of massive stars, we identified multiple instabilities that could drive structure growth. We quantified the structure growth in the non-linear simulations of O stars and WR stars by computing density power spectra and tracking their temporal evolution. Then, we compared these results to the analytical results from the stability analysis. The stability analysis leads to two possible instabilities: the convective instability and an acoustic instability. Analytic expressions for the growth rates of these different instabilities are found. In particular, strong radiative diffusion damps the growth rate $\omega$ of the convective instability leading to a distinct $\omega \sim 1/k^2$ dependence on wavenumber $k$. From our power spectra analysis of the simulations, however, we find that structure growth rather increases with $k$ - tentatively as $\omega \sim \sqrt{k}$. Our results suggest that structures in luminous O and WR star envelopes do not primarily develop from the sub-surface convective instability. Rather the growth seems compatible with either the acoustic instability in the radiation-dominated regime or with Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities, although the exact origin remains inconclusive for now.</description>

Abstract: Massive stars play a very important role in many astrophysical fields. Yet, some fundamental aspects of their evolution remain poorly constrained. In this regard, there is an open debate on the width of the main-sequence (MS) phase. We aim to create an updated Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram that includes a volume-limited and statistically significant sample of massive stars. Our goal is to use this sample to investigate the extension of the MS, including information about projected rotational velocities ($v\sin i$) and the spectroscopic binary status. We combine spectroscopic parameters derived with FASTWIND stellar atmosphere code and Gaia distances to obtain stellar parameters for 876 Galactic luminous O- and B-type stars gathered within the IACOB project. We use the ${\tt iacob-broad}$ tool to derive $v\sin i$ estimates and multi-epoch spectra to identify single/double-line spectroscopic binaries (SB1/SB2). We present an HR diagram for 670 stars located within 2500pc balancing completeness and number. We evaluate the extension of the MS in terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\approx$22.5kK within the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age main sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\sin i$ with $T_{\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We consider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond the MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the post-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full sample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of SB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1 systems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>

Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>Investigating C-D out-of-plane vibrational modes in PAHs as a tool to study interstellar deuterium-containing PAHs</title>

Abstract: Previous as well as recent observations by ISO, Spitzer, AKARI, SOFIA, JWST etc. have revealed various characteristics of mid-infrared emission bands between 3-20 micron. Subsequently, several forms of organics including Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)/PAH-like molecules are proposed as carriers for these bands. Deuterated PAH (PAD) is one such substituted PAH, which is proposed as a potential candidate carrier for weak emission bands at 4.4 and 4.65 micron, detected towards few astronomical targets and are characteristics of aromatic and aliphatic C-D stretching modes in a PAD molecule, respectively. However, the 4.4 micron band is not widely detected. In order to validate PADs as carriers for mid-infrared emission bands, an additional alternative tool is crucial. If PAHs are deuterated, they should also possess an inherent signature from the C-D out-of-plane (C-Doop) vibrations, which are at the longer wavelength side. In this report, features due to C-Doop modes in PAHs bearing a single to multiple deuterium atoms are reported by performing quantum-chemical calculations. This paper reports that some of the C-Doop vibrations appear at the 14-19 micron range. Also, the strength of C-Doop modes is not proportional to the D/H ratio in PAHs. In addition, a moderate change in the spectra of deuterated PAHs is observed from that of the undeuterated counterparts, as deuteration would alternate the adjacency class of the C-H bonds and the symmetry of the molecule. We discuss the efficiency and usefulness of these bands to constrain the form of PAHs emitting mid-infrared emission bands.</description>
