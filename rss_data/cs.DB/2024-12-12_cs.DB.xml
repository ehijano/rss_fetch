      <title>Towards Agentic Schema Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large enterprise databases can be complex and messy, obscuring the data semantics needed for analytical tasks. We propose a semantic layer in-between the database and the user as a set of small and easy-to-interpret database views, effectively acting as a refined version of the schema. To discover these views, we introduce a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) simulation where LLM agents collaborate to iteratively define and refine views with minimal input. Our approach paves the way for LLM-powered exploration of unwieldy databases.</description>

      <title>Dynamic data summarization for hierarchical spatial clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) finds meaningful patterns in spatial data by considering density and spatial proximity. As the clustering algorithm is inherently designed for static applications, so have recent studies focused on accelerating the algorithm for static applications using approximate or parallel methods. However, much less attention has been given to dynamic environments, where even a single point insertion or deletion can require recomputing the clustering hierarchy from scratch due to the need of maintaining the minimum spanning tree (MST) over a complete graph. This paper addresses the challenge of enhancing the clustering algorithm for dynamic data. We present an exact algorithm that maintains density information and updates the clustering hierarchy of HDBSCAN during point insertions and deletions. Considering the hardness of adapting the exact algorithm to dynamic data involving modern workloads, we propose an online-offline framework. The online component efficiently summarizes dynamic data using a tree structure, called Bubble-tree, while the offline step performs the static clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that the data summarization adapts well to fully dynamic environments, providing compression quality on par with existing techniques while significantly improving runtime performance of the clustering algorithm in dynamic data workloads.</description>

      <title>Magneto: Combining Small and Large Language Models for Schema Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language models opened new opportunities to address complex schema matching tasks. Schema matching approaches have been proposed that demonstrate the usefulness of language models, but they have also uncovered important limitations: Small language models (SLMs) require training data (which can be both expensive and challenging to obtain), and large language models (LLMs) often incur high computational costs and must deal with constraints imposed by context windows. We present Magneto, a cost-effective and accurate solution for schema matching that combines the advantages of SLMs and LLMs to address their limitations. By structuring the schema matching pipeline in two phases, retrieval and reranking, Magneto can use computationally efficient SLM-based strategies to derive candidate matches which can then be reranked by LLMs, thus making it possible to reduce runtime without compromising matching accuracy. We propose a self-supervised approach to fine-tune SLMs which uses LLMs to generate syntactically diverse training data, and prompting strategies that are effective for reranking. We also introduce a new benchmark, developed in collaboration with domain experts, which includes real biomedical datasets and presents new challenges to schema matching methods. Through a detailed experimental evaluation, using both our new and existing benchmarks, we show that Magneto is scalable and attains high accuracy for datasets from different domains.</description>

      <title>Maximal Clique Enumeration with Hybrid Branching and Early Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximal clique enumeration (MCE) is crucial for tasks like community detection and biological network analysis. Existing algorithms typically adopt the branch-and-bound framework with the vertex-oriented Bron-Kerbosch (BK) branching strategy, which forms the sub-branches by expanding the partial clique with a vertex. In this paper, we present a novel approach called HBBMC, a hybrid framework combining vertex-oriented BK branching and edge-oriented BK branching, where the latter adopts a branch-and-bound framework which forms the sub-branches by expanding the partial clique with an edge. This hybrid strategy enables more effective pruning and helps achieve a worst-case time complexity better than the best known one under a condition that holds for the majority of real-world graphs. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an early termination technique, which leverages the topological information of the graphs and constructs the maximal cliques directly without branching. Our early termination technique is applicable to all branch-and-bound frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our techniques.</description>

      <title>Parameterised Complexity of Consistent Query Answering via Graph Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study consistent query answering via different graph representations. First, we introduce solution-conflict hypergraphs in which nodes represent facts and edges represent either conflicts or query solutions. Considering a monotonic query and a set of antimonotonic constraints, we present an explicit algorithm for counting the number of repairs satisfying the query based on a tree decomposition of the solution-conflict hypergraph. The algorithm not only provides fixed-parameter tractability results for data complexity over expressive query and constraint classes, but also introduces a novel and potentially implementable approach to repair counting. Second, we consider the Gaifman graphs arising from MSO descriptions of consistent query answering. Using a generalization of Courcelle's theorem, we then present fixed-parameter tractability results for combined complexity over expressive query and constraint classes.</description>

      <title>A Principled Solution to the Disjunction Problem of Diagrammatic Query Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding unambiguous diagrammatic representations for first-order logical formulas and relational queries with arbitrarily nested disjunctions has been a surprisingly long-standing unsolved problem. We refer to this problem as the disjunction problem (of diagrammatic query representations).
  This work solves the disjunction problem. Our solution unifies, generalizes, and overcomes the shortcomings of prior approaches for disjunctions. It extends the recently proposed Relational Diagrams and is identical for disjunction-free queries. However, it can preserve the relational patterns and the safety for all well-formed Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC) queries, even with arbitrary disjunctions. Additionally, its size is proportional to the original TRC query and can thus be exponentially more succinct than Relational Diagrams.</description>

      <title>Mayfly: Private Aggregate Insights from Ephemeral Streams of On-Device User Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Mayfly, a federated analytics approach enabling aggregate queries over ephemeral on-device data streams without central persistence of sensitive user data. Mayfly minimizes data via on-device windowing and contribution bounding through SQL-programmability, anonymizes user data via streaming differential privacy (DP), and mandates immediate in-memory cross-device aggregation on the server -- ensuring only privatized aggregates are revealed to data analysts. Deployed for a sustainability use case estimating transportation carbon emissions from private location data, Mayfly computed over 4 million statistics across more than 500 million devices with a per-device, per-week DP $\varepsilon = 2$ while meeting strict data utility requirements. To achieve this, we designed a new DP mechanism for Group-By-Sum workloads leveraging statistical properties of location data, with potential applicability to other domains.</description>

      <title>Provenance Analysis and Semiring Semantics for First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A provenance analysis for a query evaluation or a model checking computation extracts information on how its result depends on the atomic facts of the model or database. Traditional work on data provenance was, to a large extent, restricted to positive query languages or the negation-free fragment of first-order logic and showed how provenance abstractions can be usefully described as elements of commutative semirings -- most generally as multivariate polynomials with positive integer coefficients. We describe and evaluate here a provenance approach for dealing with negation, based on quotient semirings of polynomials with dual indeterminates. This not only provides a semiring provenance analysis for full first-order logic (and other logics and query languages with negation) but also permits a reverse provenance analysis, i.e., finding models that satisfy various properties under given provenance tracking assumptions. We describe the potential for applications to explaining missing query answers or failures of integrity constraints, and to using these explanations for computing repairs. This approach also is the basis of a systematic study of semiring semantics in a broad logical context.</description>

      <title>StructRide: A Framework to Exploit the Structure Information of Shareability Graph in Ridesharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ridesharing services play an essential role in modern transportation, which significantly reduces traffic congestion and exhaust pollution. In the ridesharing problem, improving the sharing rate between riders can not only save the travel cost of drivers but also utilize vehicle resources more efficiently. The existing online-based and batch-based methods for the ridesharing problem lack the analysis of the sharing relationship among riders, leading to a compromise between efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the graph is a powerful tool to analyze the structure information between nodes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework, namely StructRide, to utilize the structure information to improve the results for ridesharing problems. Specifically, we extract the sharing relationships between riders to construct a shareability graph. Then, we define a novel measurement shareability loss for vehicles to select groups of requests such that the unselected requests still have high probabilities of sharing. Our SARD algorithm can efficiently solve dynamic ridesharing problems to achieve dramatically improved results. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our SARD algorithm on two real datasets. Our SARD can run up to 72.68 times faster and serve up to 50% more requests than the state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Numerical Estimation of Spatial Distributions under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating spatial distributions is important in data analysis, such as traffic flow forecasting and epidemic prevention. To achieve accurate spatial distribution estimation, the analysis needs to collect sufficient user data. However, collecting data directly from individuals could compromise their privacy. Most previous works focused on private distribution estimation for one-dimensional data, which does not consider spatial data relation and leads to poor accuracy for spatial distribution estimation. In this paper, we address the problem of private spatial distribution estimation, where we collect spatial data from individuals and aim to minimize the distance between the actual distribution and estimated one under Local Differential Privacy (LDP). To leverage the numerical nature of the domain, we project spatial data and its relationships onto a one-dimensional distribution. We then use this projection to estimate the overall spatial distribution. Specifically, we propose a reporting mechanism called Disk Area Mechanism (DAM), which projects the spatial domain onto a line and optimizes the estimation using the sliced Wasserstein distance. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our DAM approach on both real and synthetic data sets, compared with the state-of-the-art methods, such as Multi-dimensional Square Wave Mechanism (MDSW) and Subset Exponential Mechanism with Geo-I (SEM-Geo-I). Our results show that our DAM always performs better than MDSW and is better than SEM-Geo-I when the data granularity is fine enough.</description>

      <title>Towards Data-centric Machine Learning on Directed Graphs: a Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made significant advances in processing structured data. However, most of them primarily adopted a model-centric approach, which simplifies graphs by converting them into undirected formats and emphasizes model designs. This approach is inherently limited in real-world applications due to the unavoidable information loss in simple undirected graphs and the model optimization challenges that arise when exceeding the upper bounds of this sub-optimal data representational capacity. As a result, there has been a shift toward data-centric methods that prioritize improving graph quality and representation. Specifically, various types of graphs can be derived from naturally structured data, including heterogeneous graphs, hypergraphs, and directed graphs. Among these, directed graphs offer distinct advantages in topological systems by modeling causal relationships, and directed GNNs have been extensively studied in recent years. However, a comprehensive survey of this emerging topic is still lacking. Therefore, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of directed graph learning, with a particular focus on a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first introduce a novel taxonomy for existing studies. Subsequently, we re-examine these methods from the data-centric perspective, with an emphasis on understanding and improving data representation. It demonstrates that a deep understanding of directed graphs and their quality plays a crucial role in model performance. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of directed GNNs across 10+ domains, highlighting their broad applicability. Finally, we identify key opportunities and challenges within the field, offering insights that can guide future research and development in directed graph learning.</description>

      <title>GEE-OPs: An Operator Knowledge Base for Geospatial Code Generation on the Google Earth Engine Platform Powered by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the scale and complexity of spatiotemporal data continue to grow rapidly, the use of geospatial modeling on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform presents dual challenges: improving the coding efficiency of domain experts and enhancing the coding capabilities of interdisciplinary users. To address these challenges and improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in geospatial code generation tasks, we propose a framework for building a geospatial operator knowledge base tailored to the GEE JavaScript API. This framework consists of an operator syntax knowledge table, an operator relationship frequency table, an operator frequent pattern knowledge table, and an operator relationship chain knowledge table. By leveraging Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) techniques and frequent itemset mining, we systematically extract operator knowledge from 185,236 real GEE scripts and syntax documentation, forming a structured knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves over 90% accuracy, recall, and F1 score in operator knowledge extraction. When integrated with the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) strategy for LLM-based geospatial code generation tasks, the knowledge base improves performance by 20-30%. Ablation studies further quantify the necessity of each knowledge table in the knowledge base construction. This work provides robust support for the advancement and application of geospatial code modeling techniques, offering an innovative approach to constructing domain-specific knowledge bases that enhance the code generation capabilities of LLMs, and fostering the deeper integration of generative AI technologies within the field of geoinformatics.</description>
