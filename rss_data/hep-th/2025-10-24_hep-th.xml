      <title>Perturbations and Greybody Factors of AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Quintessence-like Field in NLED Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves and advances in black hole imaging have opened new opportunities to probe exotic physics in strong-field regimes. Building upon a recent black hole solution in Einstein gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and exotic matter sources-specifically a cloud of strings and a quintessence field--we study the perturbative dynamics, thermodynamic behavior, and quantum transmission characteristics in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The black hole, defined by its mass, nonlinear magnetic charge, string cloud, and quintessence parameters, exhibits modified spacetime geometry, horizon structure, Hawking temperature, and effective potentials governing field propagation. We derive Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations for massless scalar, electromagnetic, and fermionic perturbations, exploring how these sources jointly shape the potential barriers. The Hawking temperature shows strong dependence on the horizon radius and nonlinear charge, differing markedly from asymptotically flat cases due to the cosmological constant. Greybody factors, describing Hawking radiation transmission probabilities, are computed for all field spins via turning point analysis. A notable result arises in the fermionic sector: positive and negative helicity modes attain maximal transmission at distinct quintessence normalization values, revealing helicity-dependent coupling absent in bosonic channels. This asymmetry suggests a potential observational signature of spin-exotic matter interactions, offering new insights into detecting quintessence through black hole radiation spectra. Our results extend previous perturbative analyses by incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics, cosmic strings, and quintessence effects--linking quantum radiation studies to gravitational wave astronomy and early-universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>New Recursions for the Canonical Scalar-Scaffolded Yang-Mills Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently-developed "scalar-scaffolding" formulation of gluon amplitudes casts the Yang-Mills (YM) amplitude as a well-defined Laurent series expansion in scalar variables, valid for any spacetime dimension and helicity configuration. In this letter, we exploit this new perspective to develop conceptually novel methods of computing YM tree amplitudes. First, using standard gluon factorization to determine all terms with poles, we show how gauge invariance uniquely fixes the piece with no poles (the "contact term") from only terms that have a single pole. This allows us to write a YM recursion not only for the full amplitude but also for the amplitude up to any order in the Laurent series. Next, by imposing gauge invariance for terms with poles, we write down relations which compute numerators recursively in the amplitude's Laurent series expansion. Starting from an initial set of cuts depending only on the $(n-1)$-point amplitude, these formulae allow us to determine the remaining terms in the $n$-point amplitude. Finally, we use this "Laurent series recursion" to derive a recursion solely for the contact term. We speculate on the possibility that this and analogous recursions for any term in the amplitude may be solved. In attached Mathematica notebooks, we give implementations of these three recursions.</description>

      <title>From Partons to Strings: Scattering on the Coulomb Branch of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scattering on the Coulomb branch of planar ${\mathcal{N}}=4$ SYM at finite 't Hooft coupling. This setup defines a family of classical open-string S-matrices that smoothly interpolates between perturbative parton scattering at weak coupling and flat-space string scattering at strong coupling. We focus on the four-point amplitude, which exhibits a remarkably rich structure: nonlinear Regge trajectories, dual conformal invariance, an intricate spectrum of bound states with an accumulation point, and a two-particle cut. Dual conformal invariance relates the spectrum of Regge trajectories to the energy spectrum of the Maldacena-Wilson cusp Hamiltonian. This connection allows us to use integrability to compute the leading and subleading Regge trajectories at finite coupling, which we then input in the bootstrap analysis. At strong coupling, we use the worldsheet bootstrap to construct the first $AdS$-curvature correction to the Veneziano amplitude. We apply dispersion relations and S-matrix bootstrap techniques to derive bounds on Wilson coefficients, couplings to bound states, and the overall shape of the amplitude. We find that the $\mathcal{N}=4$ amplitude saturates the bootstrap bounds at weak coupling and nearly saturates them at strong coupling. At intermediate coupling, the amplitude traces a nontrivial path through the allowed space of observables. To characterize this path, we combine the weak- and strong-coupling information about the amplitude to construct a finite-coupling model for Wilson coefficients using a Pad\'{e} approximation. The resulting model satisfies bootstrap constraints and yields sharp predictions for the finite-coupling behavior of the amplitude. We provide evidence that complete monotonicity of the scattering amplitude, previously observed perturbatively, persists at finite coupling.</description>

      <title>Cusps in 3d gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three dimensional hyperbolic manifolds have accumulation points in the spectrum of their volumes, leading to a divergence in the sum over topologies. The limit points are cusped hyperbolic manifolds, and we propose to renormalize the sum by including the cusped manifold as a counterterm. This gives a reinterpretation of the zeta-function regularization procedure used by Maloney and Witten in the sum over SL(2,Z) black holes. For pure N = 1 supergravity, cusps with even spin structure can be used in a similar way. Cusps with odd spin structure are not needed to cancel any divergence, but they find an application by making the index nonzero.</description>

      <title>Probing the Hierarchy of Genuine Multipartite Entanglement with Generalized Latent Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce generalization of the recently proposed Latent Entropy (L-entropy) [1] as a refined measure of genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) in pure states of $n$-party quantum systems. Generalized L-entropy satisfies the axioms required for a valid GME measure and provides a natural ordering among $k$-uniform states maximizing for absolutely maximally entangled states (AME), effectively capturing the hierarchical structure of multipartite entanglement. We analyze the behavior of this measure for $n$-party Haar-random states and demonstrate that, in the large local-dimension limit, the maximal L-entropy saturates its upper bound for odd $n$, while for even $n$ it approaches the bound asymptotically. Furthermore, we apply this framework to examine multipartite entanglement properties of quantum states in several variants of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model, including SYK$_4$, SYK$_2$, mass-deformed SYK, sparse SYK, and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric SYK. The results demonstrate that the generalized L-entropy serves as a sensitive probe of multipartite entanglement, revealing how deformations influence quantum entanglement structure in such strongly interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Novel Defect Universality Classes from Interacting RG Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for new defect universality classes by considering localised interactions placed on an RG interface separating two interacting multiscalar CFTs in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. Studying interactions spread throughout the entire interface as well as defects restricted to lines and surfaces within the interface, we find that this setup leads to a great number of additional physical fixed points in the space of conformal defects. At one loop it is possible to interpret these fixed points as coming from defects placed within a single bulk whose interaction is an average of the two sides. This averaging means that it is possible to identify conformal defects with considerably less global symmetry than was possible beforehand. We finally compute conformal data for this setup, and find the free energy associated with these RG interfaces.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Points of $\mathcal{N}=1$ Modular Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity theories with modular symmetry, where the modulus $\tau$ is the upper half-plane modulo $SL(2,\mathbf{Z})$ action. We focus on enhanced discrete gauge symmetry points $\tau=i, \exp(2\pi i/3)$, and argue that, if there are no new additional massless fields at these points, they will always be critical points of the scalar potential. Moreover, we show that whether these correspond to dS, AdS, or Minkowski vacua can be generically determined simply by the weight of the superpotential under modular transformations. We also analyze the asymptotics of the scalar potential and find that compatibility with the Swampland principles implies that, if nonvanishing, the scalar potential decays either exponentially or double-exponentially, and that the asymptotic slope is bounded. The slope is governed by the superpotential weight as well as by real-analytic modular contributions to the K\"ahler potential.</description>

      <title>Anomaly-induced vanishing of brane partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the presence of 't Hooft anomalies, backgrounds for the symmetries of a quantum field theory can lead to non-conservation of Noether currents, or more generally, to the presence of charged insertions in the path integral. When there is a net background charge, the partition function evaluated on closed manifolds will vanish. For anomalous symmetries, this statement can also be understood as the anomaly theory giving rise to a non-trivial anomalous phase for the partition function even for "rigid" transformations which leave all background fields unchanged. We use the generalisation of this second viewpoint to the setting of anomalous higher-form symmetries in order to show vanishing of the partition function for a number of examples, both with and without a Lagrangian description. In particular, we show how to derive from these considerations the analogue of the Freed-Witten anomaly cancellation condition for the M5-brane, and also that for the D3-brane in S-fold backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Covariant phase space and the semi-classical Einstein equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariant phase space formalism in general relativity is a covariant method for constructing the symplectic two-form, Hamiltonian and other conserved charges on the phase space of solutions to the Einstein equation with classical matter. In this note, we consider a generalization of this formalism to the semi-classical Einstein equation coupled to quantum matter. Given a family of solutions in semi-classical gravity, we define the semi-classical symplectic two-form -- a natural generalization of the classical sympelctic two-form -- as the sum of the gravitational symplectic form and the Berry curvature associated to the quantum state of matter. We show that the semi-classical symplectic two-form is independent of the Cauchy slice, and satisfies the quantum generalization of the classical Hollands-Iyer-Wald identity. For small perturbations, we also extend our discussion to gauge-invariantly defined subregions of spacetime, where the quantum contribution is replaced by the Berry curvature of certain special purifications involving the Connes cocycle. In the AdS/CFT context, the semi-classical symplectic form defined here is naturally dual to the Berry curvature in the boundary CFT.</description>

      <title>A - BCD dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose 4d and 3d dualities among special unitary gauge theories with fundamentals and antisymmetric flavors and symplectic or orthogonal gauge theories with fundamentals and two index tensor matter. The various dualities originate from a conjectured 4d self-duality for $SU(N)$ with an antisymmetric and four fundamental flavors. While we provide a proof of such self duality for $SU(4)$, we focus on baryonic deformations for the cases at higher ranks. The deformations give rise to RG flows, deforming the self duality into new types of dualities, involving $SU(N)$ and $USp(2M)$ gauge theories, where the precise value of $M$ depends on the baryonic deformation. We provide strong checks on the validity of these dualities, by proving the integral identities among their superconformal index. By dimensional reduction on a circle, real mass flows and other deformations we then find a rich set of new dualities in 3d. These dualities are first conjectured from localization, by the application of the duplication formula for the one loop determinants of the matter fields, and then they are proved by using the tensor deconfinement technique.</description>

      <title>On FLRW reductions of N=1 supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An FLRW reduction of N=1 supergravity is troublesome since spatial isotropy prohibits a non-vanishing Rarita-Schwinger field. In view of this, we consider the quadratic form $\psi_m^{\ \alpha} \psi_{n \alpha}$ arising from a particular superspace generalization of the metric tensor. Imposing the FLRW form on this object reduces $\psi_m^{\ \alpha}$ to a single 2-component spinor $\phi^\alpha$, which becomes the superpartner of both the scale factor $a$ and lapse $N$, thus inducing the conformal time gauge, $N=a$. Time-reparametrization invariance is restored if we allow for deviations of FLRW form that are proportional to the gauge fields $N, \psi_0^{\ \alpha}$. We determine the allowed supergravity transformations that preserve the resulting FLRW supermultiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the chiral algebra bootstrap, which computes form factors of twistorial theories, can help determine two-loop amplitudes in massless QCD. We give an $n$-gluon result for a previously unknown partial amplitude of the two-loop all-plus-helicity QCD amplitude by utilizing supersymmetry Ward identities and known chiral algebra bootstrap results. We then show that the full-color two-loop $n$-gluon amplitude of QCD with $n_f$ quark flavors can be obtained from certain two-loop form factors of twistorial theories and one-loop and tree-level amplitudes. Chiral algebra bootstrap results exist for these form factors when all gluons have positive helicities. Hence, the bootstrap simplifies the computation of these two-loop amplitudes by one loop level.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and topological classifications of static non-extremal four-charge AdS black hole in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$, $STU-W^2U$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate thermodynamical aspects of a novel static non-extremal black hole solution in the five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) space carrying four independent electric charge parameters and with a negative cosmological constant, within the framework of $D=5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets specified by the pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. A central outcome of our work is the demonstration that the thermodynamics of this solution consistently satisfies both the differential and integral forms of the first law of black hole thermodynamics. When the fourth charge is set to zero, our configuration reduces to the known three-charge static non-extremal AdS$_5$ black hole within the gauged $STU$ model, and its thermodynamic behavior connects smoothly to that limit. Finally, we also provide a brief discussion about topological classifications of its thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real eigenpairs of a real antisymmetric tensor of order $p$ and dimension $N$ can be defined as pairs of a real eigenvalue and $p$ orthonormal $N$-dimensional real eigenvectors. We compute the signed and the genuine distributions of such eigenvalues of Gaussian random real antisymmetric tensors by using a quantum field theoretical method. An analytic expression for finite $N$ is obtained for the signed distribution and the analytic large-$N$ asymptotic forms for both. We compute the edge of the distribution for large-$N$, one application of which is to give an upper bound (believed tight) of the injective norm of the random real antisymmetric tensor. We find a large-$N$ universality across various tensor eigenvalue distributions: the large-$N$ asymptotic forms of the distributions of the eigenvalues $z$ of the complex, complex symmetric, real symmetric, and real antisymmetric random tensors are all expressed by $e^{N\,B\, h_p(z_c^2/z^2)+o(N)}$, where the function $h_p(\cdot)$ depends only on the order $p$, while $B$ and $z_c$ differ for each case, $NB$ being the total dimension of the eigenvectors and $z_c$ being determined by the phase transition point of the quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties, such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system, several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes. Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole configurations.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Six-Gluon QCD Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a symbol-level bootstrap construction of the planar, two-loop six-gluon scattering amplitude for the --++++ helicity configuration in QCD, focusing on the maximal weight pieces-the "most complicated terms" in the sense of Lipatov et al. Building on recent advances in the understanding of the relevant function space, we incorporate as a crucial new ingredient the complete set of leading singularities, obtained from an explicit analysis of on-shell diagrams. The resulting expressions are manifestly conformally invariant and clarify the structure of previous five-particle results. Combining this with the symbol bootstrap, we show that constraints from physical limits are sufficient to uniquely determine the answer. We thus obtain the first concrete characterization of two-loop six-gluon amplitudes at the symbol level and at highest weight. Remarkably, we find that the effective function space involves only 137 symbol letters, significantly fewer than the full set of 167 possible letters, suggesting a yet-unexplained underlying structure akin to that seen in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. From the novel amplitude results we extract previously unknown symbol-level results describing two-loop triple collinear and double soft limits.</description>

      <title>BDS ansatz in ABJM via scaffolding triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the infrared divergence of two-loop amplitudes at arbitrary multiplicity in three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=6$ Chern-Simons matter theory. We introduce the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) integrand, which captures the full infrared structure while remaining free of unphysical cuts. We show that these local integrands, together with their kinematic prefactors, are naturally organized by the scaffolding triangulations of $n=2k$-gon, with distinct triangulations yielding different local representations. Remarkably, this triangulation structure also persists at the level of the integrated functions. This observation provides a graphical proof of both the cancellation of elliptic cuts and the triangulation independence of the integrated result. As a direct consequence, we obtain a simple proof that the integrated BDS integrand coincides with the one-loop maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitude (the BDS ansatz) of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory for all $n=2k$.</description>

      <title>Naturalness of vanishing black-hole tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a symmetry argument for the vanishing and non-renormalization of static Love numbers for spherically symmetric black holes at full nonlinear order in four-dimensional General Relativity. The symmetry is realized both in full GR and in the worldline EFT, allowing for a unified treatment and proving both vanishing and non-renormalization to all orders. This closes some loop-holes in previous arguments that neglected nonlinearities in the worldline EFT, and extends previous vanishing results to all nonlinear static tides. When extended to higher-dimensional gravity, these arguments also explain the pattern of vanishing and running static Love numbers of electric and tensor type, and predict new results at the nonlinear order. We also apply our findings to the tidal response of shift-symmetric scalar fields, predicting the vanishing of even order nonlinear static Love numbers and unifying these statements with the no-hair theorem (and its violations).</description>

      <title>Dynamical entropy of charged black objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for electromagnetic potential-charge contributions to the first law of black hole mechanics, applicable to dynamical first-order perturbations of stationary black objects with possibly non-compact bifurcate Killing horizons. Working in the covariant phase space formalism, we derive both comparison and physical process versions of the first law. We consider generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity in $D$ spacetime dimensions, containing non-minimally coupled abelian $p$-form gauge fields. The pullback of the gauge field to the horizon is allowed to diverge while its field strength remains smooth, yielding gauge-invariant electric potential-charge pairs in the first law. We further extend the construction to include magnetic charges by developing a bundle-covariant, gauge-invariant prescription that fixes the Jacobson-Kang-Myers ambiguity in the improved Noether charge. Electric and magnetic charges are, respectively, associated with non-trivial $(D - p - 1)$- and $(p + 1)$-cycles of the horizon cross-section, whose homology classes determine the number of independent potential-charge pairs through the Betti numbers $b_{D - p - 1}$ and $b_{p + 1}$. Further, the dynamical gravitational entropy entering the first law is identified with the gauge-invariant part of the improved Noether charge, giving a gauge-invariant extension of the recent proposal by Hollands, Wald and Zhang. We illustrate our framework with dyonic AdS black holes, dipole black rings, and charged black branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.</description>

      <title>Theta-term in Russian Doll Model: phase structure, quantum metric and BPS multifractality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the deterministic and disordered versions of the Russian Doll Model (RDM), which is a generalization of Richardson model of superconductivity in a finite system with time-reversal symmetry breaking parameter $\theta$. It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A rich phase structure in the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where $\gamma \log N$ quantifies the hopping term.
  For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global charge $Q(\theta,\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\gamma)$ exhibits the analogue of "charge concentration" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a strong coupling point $\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\theta_{RDM}= \theta_{4D}-\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes the mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings provide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in the sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to dense QCD with $\theta$ term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nearly critical behaviour of holographic superfluids at finite temperature and chemical potential. Using analytic techniques in the bulk, we derive an effective theory for the long wavelength dynamics of gapless and pseudo-gapped modes, at first subleading order in a derivative expansion and we match the classical limit of our field theory construction in a companion paper. Specifically, we obtain the constitutive relations for the stress tensor and electric current, as well as a time evolution equation for the order parameter at next-to-leading order. In addition, we get explicit formulas for all the transport coefficients in terms of background quantities. We carry out numerical cross-checks with the predictions of our effective theory close to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Real critical exponents from the $\varepsilon$-expansion in an interacting $U(1)$ model with non-Hermitian $Z_4$ anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum optics and condensed matter physics non-Hermitian phenomena are often studied under the assumption of an open physical system. However, there are examples of intrinsically non-Hermitian, though often $\mathcal{PT}$ (parity-time) symmetric, not necessarily open systems, in which case the concept of gain and loss relative to an underlying environment is not primordial. A particularly intriguing example with experimental consequences in the literature is QCD at finite density. Motivated by the existence of such inherently non-Hermitian systems, here we study the critical behavior of a $U(1)$-invariant Lagrangian perturbed by a complex, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric $Z_{4}$ anisotropy. We find real critical exponents both in the region of unbroken and broken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. In the former the coupling constants for fixed points or lines are real, whereas in the latter they become complex. Importantly, the most stable fixed point corresponds to the flow at large distances towards an effectively Hermitian $U(1)$ symmetric system. This constitutes an example where both the $U(1)$ and the Hermitian character are emergent features of the theory. This tells us about the importance and physical meaning of some non-Hermitian systems beyond interpretations involving gain and loss.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Black Hole Lensing and the Unified Weak-to-Strong Deflection Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical framework that unifies weak-field and strong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric, even-parity quasinormal mode with $\ell=2$, $m=0$ and complex frequency $\omega$. Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while keeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent line-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a static observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic expansion yields the familiar weak-field $1/b$ law with a ringdown-frequency correction that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere expansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic strong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small oscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the background static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities like centroid motion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, and photon-ring morphology are gauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing that the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius modulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field correction. The result is a coherent, purely theoretical account of how ringdown physics imprints on imaging observables without numerical ray tracing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extra dimensions are present in many beyond the Standard Model scenarios, most notably in string theory. However, direct signatures of extra dimensions are difficult to observe in many cases. This is the situation, for example, if the energy scales associated with extra dimensions are close to the string or Grand Unification scale. The energetic early universe provides an exciting opportunity to overcome this challenge, since the heavy states associated with high-scale extra dimensions, such as scalar moduli and Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons, could have been produced on-shell at early epochs. In this work, we illustrate this by focusing on how such states can be produced during inflation and leave signatures in primordial non-Gaussianity (NG). Specifically, we consider a 5D spacetime with a warped extra dimension that remains stabilized as inflation proceeds in the four non-compact dimensions. By discussing an explicit stabilization mechanism, we compute the masses and couplings of the radion modulus and the KK graviton modes. Being gravitational degrees of freedom, these unavoidably couple to the field(s) generating curvature perturbation, and can lead to observable NG with a distinctive oscillatory shape and characteristic angular dependence. We give example benchmarks which can already be probed by the Planck data and identify targets for the future. Our study shows that cosmological surveys have the potential to observe on-shell imprints of extra dimensions in the coming years.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 5$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutron Skin through Event-by-Event Pion Asymmetry in Heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for probing the neutron skin thickness of gold (Au) by analyzing the event-by-event distribution of $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{+}$ yield differences. This is achieved through SMASH simulations of ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV. Our results demonstrate that the mean value of $\Delta n_{\pi} = n_{\pi^{-}} - n_{\pi^{+}}$, along with the Pearson correlation and mutual information between $(\pi^{-}+\pi^{+})$ and $(\pi^{-}-\pi^{+})$, all scale linearly with the neutron skin thickness. Moreover, the slope of the line connecting two distinct $\Delta n_{\pi}$ values in the event-by-event distribution also exhibits a linear dependence on the neutron skin thickness. The most sensitive $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs are identified as $(-1, 1)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(0, 2)$. These findings establish a new pathway for determining the neutron skin thickness. Finally, by comparing SMASH and UrQMD simulations under identical initial conditions, we observe that individual slope values depend on the specific collision model. However, by extracting slopes from multiple $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs in experimental event-by-event data and inferring the corresponding neutron skin thickness, one can assess which model better aligns with the true physical value.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet entropy and thermal dynamics of RN-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of a novel solution for the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole, uniquely incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications, this inclusion allows for a modified entropy formulation, facilitating the computation of key thermodynamic quantities such as Gibbs free energy, the first law of thermodynamics, the equation of state, and Hawking temperature. We identify critical points and graphically represent the relationship between temperature and Gibbs free energy as a function of the horizon radius. Ultimately, we assess the thermal stability of the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-AdS black hole within the framework of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, emphasizing the influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term unlike previous studies that primarily focused on standard General Relativity or other modifications. As a result, it is found that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the thermodynamic behavior and stability structure of the black hole, revealing richer phase transition phenomena.</description>

      <title>Emergent time and more from wavefunction collapse in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we further develop a recently proposed theory of time based on wavefunction collapse in general relativity. It is based on the postulations that quantum states, which violate the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints, represent instances of time, and stochastic fluctuations of the lapse and shift generate the time evolution under which an initial state gradually collapses toward a diffeomorphism-invariant state. Under the wavefunction collapse, the scale factor monotonically increases, thus acting as a clock. The scalar, vector, and tensor gravitons arise as physical excitations, and the arrow of time for their evolution is set by the initial state. In the long-time limit, the tensor gravitons exhibit emergent unitary dynamics. However, the extra modes are strongly damped due to the non-unitary dynamics that suppress the constraint-violating excitations. The vector mode is uniformly suppressed over all length scales, but the decay rate of the scalar is proportional to its wave vector. This makes the latter a viable candidate for dark matter; excitations with large wavelengths survive over long periods, contributing to long-range interactions, while the fast decay of short-wavelength modes renders them undetectable without sufficient temporal resolution. These are demonstrated for the cosmological constant-dominated universe through semi-classical and adiabatic approximations, which are controlled in the limit of large space dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantum Field Theory in Successive Rindler Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study successive Rindler-like transformations in Minkowski spacetime and the corresponding sequence of vacuum states perceived by observers restricted to respective wedges. Extending the standard Rindler construction to an $n$-fold iteration, we find via Bogoliubov transformations that the vacuum of the $(n-1)^{th}$ Rindler observer appears thermal to the $n^{th}$ one. The characteristic trajectories, confined to nested wedges, exhibit characteristic accelerations and horizon shifts depending on transformation parameters ${g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_{n}}$. For the second-level transformation (\emph{Rindler Rindler} case), the late time acceleration asymptotically approaches $2g_2$ for one branch and diverges for the other. We study Minkowski, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler vacuum states from the perspective of Unruh DeWitt (UDW) detectors along inertial, Rindler, and Rindler Rindler trajectories. The response of the UDW detector coupled to a real massless scalar field confirms the thermality: the transition rate of Rindler Rindler observer in Minkowski vacuum matches that of a standard Rindler detector with acceleration $2g_2$, yielding a Planckian spectrum at late times. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Bound State Perturbations in the Interior of Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit our earlier work and investigate the bound state perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The bound sates are defined as the perturbations in the interior of the black hole with an imaginary spectrum which are regular at the center of black hole while their time-dependent profile falls off exponentially on the event horizon. Using the scale factor in the expanding direction in the interior of the black hole as the clock, we rewrite the corresponding Regge-Wheeler equation and solve it semi-analytically as well as numerically. We confirm that the bound state solutions exist for scalar, vector and axial tensor perturbations. It is shown that for a given value of $\ell &gt;s$, there are total $\ell-s$ such bound states. We obtain the universal lower bound $2 G M \omega_I &gt;1$ for the spectrum of bound state which is asymptotically saturated in the large $\ell$ limit. Furthermore, we obtain an upper bound on the spectrum of axial perturbations which for large $\ell$ scales like $2 G M \omega_I \lesssim 0.04\, \ell^4 $. As observed recently, these bound states have the curious property that the profile of the total wave function has a non-zero magnitude near the future event horizon.</description>

      <title>GUT-Scale Smooth Hybrid Inflation with a Stabilized Modulus in Light of ACT and SPT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a generalized framework of smooth F-term hybrid inflation (smFHI) consistent with gauge coupling unification within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The embedding of the model in two specific Supergravity settings addresses at the same time the $\eta$ problem and the compatibility with the recent ACT or SPT data. The one relies on the choice of a shift-symmetric K\"ahler potential for the inflaton which revitalizes the SUSY predictions of smFHI, whereas the other employs a K\"ahler potential associated with an hyperbolic K\"ahler manifold. An essential role in both our constructions is played by a decoupled superheavy field without superpotential and Kaehler potential inspired by string- and D-brane--based models. Our proposal can be realized for a variety of representations for the Higgs fields involved in smFHI and assures monotonic inflationary potential.</description>

      <title>Validation of NANOGrav 15-year data and ACT data by modified inflation in entropic cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent evidences of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) through Pulsar Time Array (PTA) observations hint towards an alternative inflationary scenario, compared to the usual inflation, for describing the early stage of the universe in order to be compatible with the PTA data. Moreover, currently the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (combined with the Planck 2018 and BAO) refines the constraint on inflationary observables, compared to the only-Planck 2018 measurements. In the present work, we simultaneously address these two issues by incorporating certain modification during inflation over the usual inflationary scenario. Such modification amplifies the primordial tensor perturbation over the modes that are sensitive to the NANOGrav frequency region. For this purpose, we take the thermodynamic route of cosmology where the entropy of the apparent horizon is given by a generalized form of entropy that is able to generalize the other known form of horizon entropies for suitable representations. The constraints on the model parameters coming from the ACT data also fit the NANOGrav 15-year data (based on numerical analysis), which reveal the model's compatibility with both the ACT and the PTA data.</description>

      <title>Pole inflation from extended metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in the framework of extended metric-affine F(R) gravity, where all even-parity quadratic invariants of torsion and non-metricity are included in the Lagrangian alongside the F(R) term. The extended theory admits a scalar-tensor description with a non-canonical kinetic term featuring poles. As a result, the inflationary dynamics and predictions for observables of this model are insensitive to the specific form of F(R), since they are dominated by the structure of the poles (order and residue). We analyze both a simplified version analytically and the full eleven-parameter theory, and we classify the models based on whether they feature second-order poles, whether they are free from ghosts, and whether they predict a sufficiently small tensor-to-scalar ratio. By relaxing the ghost-free requirement to only exclude ghosts near the pole (where inflation occurs), we demonstrate that we can significantly enlarge the set of viable models. We thus show that extended metric-affine F(R) gravity can act as a robust framework for inflation, reproducing the attractor predictions for the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that black holes necessarily contain a region where general relativity breaks down, due to the inevitable formation of either a curvature singularity or a Cauchy horizon. In this work we challenge this view by analyzing a charged spherically symmetric black hole formed through gravitational collapse and evaporating via Hawking radiation. We show that the electromagnetic repulsion and the violation of energy conditions due to the presence of Hawking radiation are be sufficient to avoid the formation of both a singularity and a Cauchy horizon. We argue that a similar mechanism may apply to astrophysical black holes in which the role of the electric charge is replaced by the angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity of a binary mixture for a relativistic fluid at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the shear viscosity is a central topic in various areas of modern physics. In particular, it is often necessary to evaluate the shear viscosity $\eta$ of fluids made up of more than one species, all interacting with different cross sections. Since it may be difficult to extract information on the interaction among different species, various combinations of the viscosities of the individual components are often used. We work in the Chapman-Enskog framework and investigate on binary mixtures, by comparing such single component combinations with a full 2-component formalism: we find that, in most cases, the full viscosity is well approximated by a weighted linear average of the single component viscosities, although this result is far from being general. Moreover, we validate our 2-component Chapman-Enskog results for $\eta$ by comparing them with an independent numerical simulation of the Boltzmann equation, which estimates the shear viscosity via a Green-Kubo formula, in the case of a quasi-particle system that reproduces lattice QCD thermodynamics. We see that the temperature dependence of $\eta/s$ of such system of quarks and gluons is not well described by combinations of the individual components, highlighting the importance of inter-species scattering.</description>

      <title>Quantum black holes: inside and outside</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a unitary description of an evaporating black hole, one usually chooses the time slices that cover only outside of the event horizon, which is mostly problem-free because the event horizon is not encountered. However, is there any justification for avoiding time slices that cover inside the event horizon? To answer the question, we investigate the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, where the time slices can cover both inside and outside the event horizon. We find that one can reasonably construct a wave packet that covers outside, but the wave function must be annihilated near the event horizon. This observation strongly suggests that we cannot choose a coherent state for a spacelike hypersurface that crosses the event horizon. To explain the unitary time evolution, we must keep the slices as coherent states; hence, they must always be outside the event horizon. In contrast, inside the horizon, we cannot have a single coherent state of a classical spacetime. Hence, the interior must be a superposition of several coherent states, which implies that there exists a horizon-scale uncertainty and a black hole should be viewed as a highly quantum macroscopic object. We provide a synthetic approach to understanding the information loss paradox from this perspective.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

      <title>The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the theory is unitary at the tree level.</description>

Abstract: We define the notion of Weyl anomalies, measuring the violation of local scale invariance, in interacting quantum field theory on curved spacetimes in the framework of locally covariant field theory. We discuss some general properties of Weyl anomalies, such as their relation to the trace anomaly. We give a criterion for a theory to be conformal at the quantum level, and show that even for a conformal theory Weyl transformations in general obtain quantum corrections. We study the trace anomaly in detail for the $\phi^4$ theory, in particular determining it up to second order in the interaction. We also show that at third order in the interaction a potential $\Box \phi^2$ term can be removed by finite renormalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, BPS models built from the coupling of Yang-Mills-Higgs Lagrangian to impurities are investigated. We first consider scalar impurities, which in the BPS limit generate monopoles similar to those obtained in a previously considered class of $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{Z}_2$ or $\mathrm{SU(2)}\times\mathrm{SU(2)}$ models. We then focus on coupling with nonabelian impurities, defined as fixed backgrounds produced from fields transforming under the adjoint representation of SU(2), with a coupling chosen to preserve half of the BPS sectors. The nature of this coupling, the ensuing Bogomol'nyi bound and BPS equations, as well as the effect of these impurities in the abelianization that leads to the emergence of a U(1) gauge group are investigated. We study in greater detail impurities with spherical symmetry, and examine the manner in which impurity coupling changes the asymptotic behavior and range of monopole interactions. Moreover, we introduce a method that can be used to approximate solutions with the use of small perturbations around the Prasad-Sommerfield monopole, and discuss the possibility of extending the aforementioned results to dyons. In order to exemplify the most important properties of the theory, several specific impurity models are presented, with the respective monopole solutions are found numerically. These solutions present novel internal structure and multiple features that would not be possible in the original theory.</description>

      <title>The $\mathcal{W}$-algebra bootstrap of 6d $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08094v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6d (2,0) SCFTs of type $\mathfrak{g}$ have protected subsectors that were conjectured in arxiv:1404.1079 to be captured by $\mathcal{W}_\mathfrak{g}$ algebras. We write down the crossing equations for mixed four-point functions $\langle S_{k_1} S_{k_2}S_{k_3}S_{k_4}\rangle$ of 1/2-BPS operators $S_{k_i}$ in 6d (2,0) theories and detail how a certain twist reduces this system to a 2d meromorphic CFT multi-correlator bootstrap problem. We identify the relevant 6d (2,0) $\mathcal{W}$-algebras of type $\mathfrak{g} = \{A_{N-1},D_N\}$ as truncations of $\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$ and solve OPE associativity conditions for their structure constants, both using $\texttt{OPEdefs}$ and the holomorphic bootstrap of arxiv:1503.07111. With this, we solve the multi-correlator bootstrap for twisted 6d four-point correlators $\mathcal{F}_{k_1k_2k_3k_4}$ involving all $S_{k_i}$ up to $\{k_i\}=4$ and extract closed-form expressions for 6d OPE coefficients. We describe the implications of our CFT data on conformal Regge trajectories of the (2,0) theories and finally, demonstrate the consistency of our results with protected higher-derivative corrections to graviton scattering in M-theory on $AdS_7\times S^4/\mathbb{Z}_\mathfrak{o}$.</description>

      <title>Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with long-range interactions has garnered significant attention following the implications of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, which precludes phase transitions in most low-dimensional theories with local interactions. This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a meso- scopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider conformal Killing-Yano forms corresponding to the antisymmetric generalizations of conformal Killing vectors to higher degree forms in the presence of skew-symmetric torsion. Integrability conditions for torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms are found and a graded Lie bracket for conformal Killing-Yano forms to constitute a graded Lie algebra structure is proposed. It is found that a graded Lie algebra structure for a special subset of torsionful conformal Killing-Yano forms can be constructed for a closed and parallel skew-symmetric torsion on constant curvature and Einstein manifolds. Similar structure for generalized hidden symmetries defined from generalized connection in generalized geometry is also constructed.</description>

      <title>Mass-deformed Super Yang-Mills theory on $\mathbb T^4$: sum over twisted sectors, $\mathbf{\theta}$-angle, and CP violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory with a small gaugino mass $m$ and vacuum angle $\theta$ on the four-torus $\mathbb{T}^4$ with 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Introducing a detuning parameter $\Delta$, which measures the deviation from an exactly self-dual $\mathbb{T}^4$, and working in the limits $mLN \ll \Lambda LN \ll 1$ and $ \frac{(N-1) m^2 L^2}{4 \pi} \ll \Delta \ll 1$, where $L$ is the torus size and $\Lambda$ the strong-coupling scale, we compute the scalar and pseudo-scalar condensates to leading order in $m^2L^2/\Delta$. The twists generate fractional-charge instantons, and we show that summing over all such contributions is crucial for reproducing the correct physical observables in the decompactified strong-coupling regime. From a Hamiltonian perspective, the sum over twisted sectors, already at small torus size, projects in the $m=0$ limit onto a definite superselection sector of the $\mathbb{R}^4$ theory. In the massless limit, we recover the exact value of the gaugino condensate $|\langle \lambda \lambda \rangle| = 16\pi^2 \Lambda^3$, and demonstrate how a spurious $U(1)$ symmetry eliminates all $CP$-violating effects. Our results are directly testable in lattice simulations, and our method extends naturally to non-supersymmetric gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the three-point amplitude of curvature perturbations in scenarios suggested by high-scale supersymmetry breaking in String Theory, where the inflaton is forced to climb a steep exponential potential. We can do it at the price of some simplifications, and more importantly with some assumptions on the softening effects of String Theory. These suggest a scenario proposed long ago by Gasperini and Veneziano, where the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce, and the resulting analysis rests on a scale $\Delta$ that leaves some signs in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. The amplitude comprises two types of contribution: the first oscillates around the original result of Maldacena and gives no further prospects to detect a non-Gaussian signal, but the second, which is subtly tied to the turning point at the end of the climbing phase, within the window 62&lt;N&lt;66 for the inflationary e-folds could be compatible with Planck constraints and potentially observable. The amplitudes involving the tensor modes contain only the first type of contribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1306.2174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new local gauge invariant method is introduced in order to maximally simplify the expression for a SU(2) non-Abelian field strength. The new tetrads introduced in previous works are going to play a fundamental role in the algorithm presented in this manuscript. Three new local gauge invariant objects are going to guide us through the process of making a field strength block diagonal. The process is also covariant. Any non-trivial isospace field strength projection will become block diagonal through this gauge invariant algorithm. As an application we will find new local observables in Yang-Mills theories.</description>

      <title>Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley--Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay with respect to distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with respect to the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been believed to hold for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement can exist due to the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the entanglement Hamiltonian or Hamiltonian of mean force. As an outcome of our analyses, we improve the prior clustering theorem for bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.</description>

      <title>Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times.
  Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.</description>

      <title>Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops I: Ising universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the consistency between bulk and boundary causalities in static, spherically symmetric, asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. We derive a general formula that provides sufficient conditions for time advance, where bulk propagation arrives earlier than any boundary propagation. As an application, we show that in Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m--anti de Sitter spacetime, no geodesic satisfies the sufficient conditions for time advance even in the super-extremal case. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg theory exhibits time advance when one or a linear combination of the coupling constants is positive and below an upper bound determined by the AdS length scale.</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rates for particle interaction processes and decays will be modified in a Lorentz-violating quantum field theory, because of changes to the particle kinematics$-$particularly through the modified dispersion relations affecting the outgoing particle phase space. We outline here these changes to the rates for three-particle decays. Considering a process with a constant scattering amplitude (not directly modified by the Lorentz violation), we calculate leading order corrections to the kinematics for a decay into three identical spinless particles whose propagation is affected by a $c_{\mu\nu}$-type symmetric tensor background. We examine the angular distribution of the daughter particles and describe the shape of the corresponding Dalitz plot outlining the kinematically allowed region, according to two toy models for the $c_{\mu\nu}$ textures. Precision measurements of the boundaries of this region could be used to constrain Lorentz violation coefficients for the particles involved in processes such as $\eta\rightarrow 3\pi^{0}$.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon: quark and gluon quantum information localizes on a transverse entangling two-sphere of radius $R_{EE}$, where the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches maximal entanglement. Lattice-QCD determinations of the scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{EE}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{EE})$, yielding a parameter-free slope $c_h = 8\pi^2 R_{EE}^2 \rho_h(R_{EE})$ and a mechanical entropy $S_{EE}(y) = c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The entropy gradient $\partial_{R}S_{EE}$ changes sign at $R_{EE}$, pushing colored fields outward for $r &lt; R_{EE}$ and pulling them inward for $r &gt; R_{EE}$, thereby localizing them on the codimension-2 two-sphere $\Sigma_\perp = S^{2}_{R_{EE}}$ (which projects onto the transverse plane in the infinite-momentum frame). This furnishes a high-energy (large-$y$) diagnostic that complements -- rather than replaces -- the Wilson-loop area-law criterion in the infrared. Imposing unitarity on an entropic eikonal ansatz gives $\sigma(s) \propto y^{\delta}$: world data favor $\delta = 2$ for elastic $pp$ and heavy-quark photoproduction, while $\phi$ photoproduction prefers $\delta = 0.387$. All extracted cross sections remain well below the Froissart-Martin bound. Altogether, the framework quantifies a confinement criterion directly from nonperturbative QCD inputs, linking the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative picture.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Fragmentation of the QCD Axion on the Lattice</title>

Abstract: Kinetic misalignment, one of the most compelling scenarios for the non-thermal generation of axion dark matter, is generally accompanied by axion fragmentation, a process in which the energy of the axion condensate is transferred to its perturbations. The dynamics of fragmentation, at least in the context of dark matter production, have so far been studied semi-analytically using perturbation theory. In this work, we present the first classical lattice simulation of kinetic axion fragmentation in the context of dark matter production, focusing on parameters relevant to the QCD axion. Our findings indicate that the non-perturbative dynamics captured by the lattice lead to a significantly broader spectrum of axion fluctuations, with a sustained transfer of energy to mildly relativistic modes and with smaller occupation numbers compared to the linear approximation. As a consequence, the final dark matter abundance is typically O(1) lower than in the linear approximation, which is itself O(1) lower than the zero-mode-only prediction. This broadening and suppression of the spectrum could have a significant impact on axion mini-halo formation, one of the main experimental handles on kinetic fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy</title>

Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition.</description>

      <title>Unveiling horizons in quantum critical collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical gravitational collapse offers a unique window into regimes of arbitrarily high curvature, culminating in a naked singularity arising from smooth initial data -- thus providing a dynamical counterexample to weak cosmic censorship. Near the critical regime, quantum effects from the collapsing matter are expected to intervene before full quantum gravity resolves the singularity. Despite its fundamental significance, a self-consistent treatment has so far remained elusive. In this work, we perform a one-loop semiclassical analysis using the robust anomaly-based method in the canonical setup of Einstein gravity minimally coupled to a free, massless scalar field. Focusing on explicitly solvable critical solutions in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions, we analytically solve the semiclassical Einstein equations and provide definitive answers to several long-standing questions. We find that regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like quantum state, encoding genuine vacuum polarization effects from the collapsing matter. Remarkably, the resulting quantum corrections manifest as a growing mode. Horizon-tracing analyses, incorporating both classical and quantum modes, reveal the emergence of a finite mass gap, signaling a phase transition from classical Type II to quantum-modified Type I behavior, thereby providing a quantum enforcement of the weak cosmic censorship. The most nontrivial aspect of our analysis involves dealing with non-conformal matter fields in explicitly time-dependent critical spacetimes. Along the way, we uncover intriguing and previously underexplored features of quantum field theory in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Critical Collapse Abhors a Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical critical collapse yields naked singularities from smooth initial data, challenging cosmic censorship and shaping the spectrum of primordial black holes. We show that one-loop vacuum polarization near the threshold alters this outcome. In analytically tractable Einstein-scalar critical spacetimes, regularity uniquely selects a Boulware-like state whose stress tensor supplies a universal quantum growing mode. Its backreaction competes with the classical unstable mode, producing a shift of the critical point and a finite mass gap at the new threshold, thereby enforcing horizon formation even under arbitrary fine-tuning. In primordial collapse, the threshold shift enters exponentially into the formation fraction, while the gap truncates the low-mass tail -- effects that may reshape the predicted mass spectrum. These results provide the first consistent quantum treatment of critical collapse, offering definitive predictions for several long-standing problems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Helicity, Magnetic Monopoles, and Higgs Winding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25734v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields, from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology. It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles. We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change. The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution for the real-time dynamics following a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state in an integrable system. Although equilibration is expected in this setting because the TPQ state already encodes the thermal expectation values of all conserved quantities, the approach to equilibrium shows highly nontrivial coherent dynamics. In the spin-1/2 XX chain, local observables become stationary at their thermal values after dephasing, while the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic double-plateau structure. We obtain this behavior exactly using three complementary approaches: two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) on the Klein bottle, an exact numerical evolution based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonic entanglement evolution is a macroscopic manifestation of the coherent dephasing of anomalous pairing correlations in the initial TPQ state.</description>

      <title>Photon radiation induced by rescattering in strong-interacting medium with a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon radiation induced by rescattering in a magnetized medium is investigated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet propagating a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies in this process. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate an experimental comparison of photon yields from quark-gluon plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths.</description>
