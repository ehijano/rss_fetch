      <title>On the Cutoff Scale Identification of FLRW Cosmology in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections through the functional renormalization group flow of the effective action for gravity. We solve the Einstein equation with quantum improved coupling perturbatively including the case with non-vanishing classical cosmological constant (CC) which was overlooked in the literatures. We discuss what is the suitable identification of the momentum cutoff $k$ with time scale, and find that the choice of the Hubble parameter is suitable for vanishing CC but not so for non-vanishing CC. We suggest suitable identification in this case. The energy-scale dependent running coupling breaks the time translation symmetry and then introduces a new physical scale.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Born-Infeld-f(R) Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate anisotropic cosmological solutions within the framework of Born-Infeld-f(R) gravity, a modification of general relativity that incorporates higher-order curvature invariants. Specifically, we focus on the analysis of Bianchi type-I solutions, which provide a valuable framework for studying the evolution of spatial anisotropies in cosmology. By introducing a reconstruction scheme for this model, we explore the behavior of these solutions, analyze various cosmic evolution scenarios, including Starobinsky inflation, de Sitter-like expansion, power-law dynamics, and Big Rip-like evolution. Additionally, we examine the exponential and power-law behavior of the auxiliary metric function to illustrate its impact on the dynamics of cosmic evolution. Our analysis elucidates how the modifications introduced by Born-Infeld-f(R) gravity influence anisotropic dynamics, offering new perspectives on the late-time behavior of the universe and potential future singularities.</description>

      <title>Complete background cosmology of parity-even quadratic metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmology of metric-affine gravity is studied for the general, parity preserving action quadratic in curvature, torsion and non-metricity. The model contains 27 a priori independent couplings in addition to the Einstein constant. Linear and higher order relations between the quadratic operators in a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker spacetime are obtained, along with the modified Friedmann, torsion and non-metricity equations. Extra parameter constraints lead to two special branches of the model. Firstly, a branch is found in which the Riemannian spatial curvature (thought to be slightly closed or flat in the Lambda-CDM model of our Universe) is entirely screened from all the field equations, regardless of its true value. Secondly, an integrable branch is found which yields (anti) de Sitter expansion at late times. The particle spectra of these two branches are studied, and the need to eliminate higher-spin particles as well as ghosts and tachyons motivates further parameter constraints in each case. The most general model is also found which reproduces the exact Friedmann equations of general relativity. The full set of equations describing closed, open or flat cosmologies, for general parity-even quadratic metric-affine gravity, is made available for SymPy, Mathematica and Maple platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-equatorial scalar rings supported by rapidly spinning Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-hole spacetimes that possess stationary equatorial matter rings are known to exist in general relativity. We here reveal the existence of black-hole spacetimes that support {\it non}-equatorial matter rings. In particular, it is proved that rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes in the dimensionless large-spin regime ${\bar a}&gt;{\bar a}_{\text{crit}}= \sqrt{\big\{{{7+\sqrt{7}\cos\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\big]- \sqrt{21}\sin\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\big]}\big\}/12}}\simeq0.78$ can support a pair of non-equatorial massive scalar rings which are negatively coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant of the spinning spacetime (here ${\bar a}\equiv J/M^2$ is the dimensionless angular momentum of the central supporting black hole). We explicitly prove that these non-equatorial scalar rings are characterized by the dimensionless functional relation $-{{57+28\sqrt{21}\cos\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big({{1}\over{3\sqrt{3}}}\big)\big]} \over{8(1+\sqrt{1-{\bar a}^2})^6}} \cdot{{\bar\eta}\over{{\bar\mu}^2}}\to 1^{+}$ in the large-mass ${\bar\mu}\equiv M\mu\gg1$ regime (here $\{{\bar\eta}&lt;0,\mu\}$ are respectively the non-trivial coupling parameter of the composed Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-massive-scalar field theory and the proper mass of the supported non-minimally coupled scalar field).</description>

      <title>Stealth black holes in Aether Scalar Tensor theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory is an extension of general relativity(GR) successful at reproducing galactic rotational curves, gravitational lensing, linear large scale structure and cosmic microwave background power spectrum observations. We solve the most general static spherically symmetric vacuum equations in the strong-field regime of AeST and find two classes of stealth black hole solutions -- those with exact GR geometries -- containing non-trivial secondary hair. In particular, one of these can be continuously joined to the cosmological solution of AeST. We also derive a non-black hole solution with zero spatial component in the vector field. This result proves the existence of mathematically and observationally consistent candidates for black holes in AeST, and creates a basis for testing the theory in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization effects in the background of a deformed compact object and implications for photon velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of vacuum polarization on light propagation in the background of a distorted, deformed compact object. Focusing on a spacetime containing two quadrupole parameters associated with the central object and external fields, we explore how these parameters influence observable effects as dynamical degrees of freedom. In this setup, we investigate electromagnetic birefringence, noting distinct polarization-dependent photon velocity variations and gravitational lens effects. Although current resolution may limit detection, future high-precision observations could reveal these quantum electrodynamics (QED) induced birefringence effects, advancing our understanding of vacuum birefringence in astrophysical contexts. We further analyze the dependence of shadow properties on the model's variables, using observational data from Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with SLy/BSk class EOSs, along with the MS2 EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>A Methodological Framework for Solving Einsteins Equations in Axially Symmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel methodology for deriving stationary and axially symmetric solutions to Einstein field equations using the 1+3 tetrad formalism. This approach reformulates the Einstein equations into first order scalar equations, enabling systematic resolution in vacuum scenarios. We derive two distinct solutions in polar and hyperbolic geometries by assuming the separability of a key metric function. Our method reproduces well known solutions such as Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics and extends the case of rotating spacetimes to hyperbolic configurations. Additionally, we explore the role of Killing tensors in enabling separable metric components, simplifying analyses of geodesic motion and physical phenomena. This framework demonstrates robustness and adaptability for addressing the complexities of axially symmetric spacetimes, paving the way for further applications to Kerr like solutions in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>The imprint of cosmic expansion history on the propagation of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are regarded as standard sirens for Cosmology. GWs from compact binary coalescence (CBC) can directly determine the luminosity distance but usually can not obtain information about the redshift. However, if the universe is not flat but accelerating, GWs should carry this cosmological effect. In this Letter, for the first time, we explore how the expansion of the Universe affects GW propagation by perturbing the Robertson-Walker metric. We achieve a comprehensive and rigorous formalism at the next-leading order to describe the cosmological acceleration in GWs from any kind of sources. Theoretically, this cosmological effect will obviously amplify GWs at frequencies as low as $10^{-12}$ Hz.</description>

      <title>Free fall in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The status of the equivalence principle in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is examined. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesics, that is, the ``shortest'' paths are not the ``straightest'' paths. We show that a standard argument that singles out metric geodesics in general relativity does not apply in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity. This is because the latter theory does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. We argue, however, that the structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. The geodesic equation that governs the motion of a freely falling test particle involves the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection obtained by solving the connection field equations of the theory. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is fully equivalent to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in quantum superposed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in quantum superposition, using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum scalar field where the spacetime background is modeled as a superposition of two quotient Minkowski spaces which are not related by diffeomorphisms. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance entanglement for both twisted and untwisted field. We compute the concurrence, which quantifies the harvested entanglement, as function of the energy gap of detectors and their separation. We find that it reaches its maximum when we condition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial spacetime state. Notably, for the twisted field, the parameter region without entanglement exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical Minkowski space or a single quotient Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Chaotic orbital dynamics of pulsating stars around black holes surrounded by dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the orbital dynamics of spherical test bodies in ``black hole surrounded by dark matter halo'' spherically symmetric spacetimes. When the test body pulsates periodically (such as a variable star), altering its quadrupole tensor, Melnikov's method shows that its orbital dynamics presents homoclinic chaos near the corresponding unstable circular orbits however small the oscillation amplitude is. Since for supermassive black holes the period of revolution of a star near the innermost stable circular orbit roughly spans time intervals from minutes to hours, the formalism can be applied in principle to the astrophysical scenario of a pulsating (variable) star inspiraling into a supermassive black hole, including the black hole SgrA* at the center of our Galaxy. The chaotic nature of its orbit, due to pulsation, is imprinted in the redshift time series of the emitted light and can, in principle, be observed in the corresponding light curves and even in gravitational-wave signals detected by future observatories such as the Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna. Also, although periodic with respect to the star's proper time, the chaotic orbital motion will produce an erratic light curve (and gravitational-wave signal) in terms of observed, coordinate time. Although our results were obtained for a specific exact solution, we argue that this phenomenon is generic for pulsating bodies immersed in black hole spacetimes surrounded by self-gravitating fluids.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Description of 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an effective metric description of 2+1 dimensional black holes describing deviations from the classical Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The latter is a classical 2+1 dimensional rotating black hole with constant negative curvature. The effective metric is constrained by imposing the black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. The deformed metric is parametrized in terms of a physical quantity that we choose to be a physical distance. The latter can be solved for in three main regions of interest, the one around the horizon, origin, and spatial infinity. The finiteness of physical quantities at the horizon, such as the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, leads to universal constraints on the physical parameters of the metric around the horizon. This allows us to further derive the general form of the corrected Hawking temperature in terms of the physical parameters of the effective metric. Assuming that the approach can be generalized to the interior of the black hole, we further develop an effective metric description near the origin. To illustrate the approach, we show how to recast the information encoded in a specific model of quantum BTZ known as quBTZ black hole in terms of the effective metric coefficients.</description>

      <title>Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity which, following Figueroa-O'Farril--Have--Prohazka--Salzer, we refer to as Ti and Spi. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. The definition is invariant, is constructed solely from the asymptotic data of the metric and is such that automorphisms of the extended boundaries are canonically identified with asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, scattering data for massive fields are realised as functions on Ti and a geometric identification of cuts of Ti with points of Minkowksi then produces an integral formula of Kirchhoff type. Finally, Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group, or to Poincar\'e in the flat case. In particular, Strominger's matching conditions are naturally realised by restricting to Carrollian geometries compatible with a discrete symmetry of Spi.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective-one-body and Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon results for a spinning test particle on circular equatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spinning test particle around a rotating black hole and compare the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) formalism under the Tulczyjew-Dixon spin supplementary condition to the test-mass limit of the effective-one-body (EOB) Hamiltonian of [Phys. Rev. D.90, 044018(2014)], with enhanced spin-orbit sector. We focus on circular equatorial orbits: we first compare the constants of motion at their linear in secondary spin approximation and then we compute the gravitational-wave (GW) fluxes using a frequency domain Teukolsky equation solver. We find no difference between the EOB and MPD fluxes when the background spacetime is Schwarzschild, while the difference for a Kerr background is maximum for large, positive spins. Our work could be considered as a first step to improve the radiation reaction of the EOB model, in view of the needs of the next-generation of GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions, using the on-shell and off-shell contributions to correlators to investigate the signatures of interactions. In particular, we calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. By truncating the time integrals in the analytic expressions for contributions to the bispectrum, we define a `quantum interactivity' and quantitatively identify scales and times for which it is sufficient to only assume classical evolution, given a fixed precision. In contrast to common perceptions inspired by free two-point functions, we show that common non-linear terms of inflationary perturbations can be well-described by classical evolution even prior to horizon crossing. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. In particular, we comment on the validity of using stochastic inflation to reproduce known in-in perturbative results. An extensive appendix provides a review of the Keldysh formulation of the in-in formalism with the initial state set at a finite, as opposed to infinite past, emphasizing the importance of considering temporal boundary terms and the initial state for correctly obtaining the propagators. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficient approximation to the full quantum evolution. This becomes particularly transparent in the Keldysh description.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Hubble parameter from Pantheon+ data and comparison of cosmological models using cosmic chronometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with redshift $z$ is estimated from the Pantheon+ data of Type Ia supernovae, for the $\Lambda$CDM model and the three special cases of the eternal coasting (EC) cosmological model with three different spatial geometries. The scatter associated with $H(z)$ is seen to grow markedly with redshift. This behaviour, which is deduced directly from the SNe Hubble diagram, raises the question of whether the universe is undergoing a stochastic expansion, which scenario can offer an explanation for the Hubble tension in cosmology. From the estimated $H(z)$ values, the present value of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ is evaluated for each of these models through regression, and the scatter using the Monte Carlo method. Bayesian comparison between these models is carried out using the data of 35 cosmic chronometers (CC). The comparative study favours the $\Lambda$CDM model, with some strong evidence. However, exclusion of four outlier CC data points with small errorbars leads to large reduction in the Bayes factor value. The unusually large value of Bayes factor obtained while using the full set of CC data raises some concerns about its tension with other data, such as that of the SNe Ia. While using the remaining 31 CC data points, it is observed that the resulting Bayes factor still favours the $\Lambda$CDM model, but with a much smaller value of the Bayes factor. When EC models are compared among themselves, the $\Omega = 2$ model has strong evidence than the $\Omega = 1$ (also known as $R_h = ct$) and the $\Omega = 0$ (Milne-type) models.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between quantum error correcting codes and quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this clear parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for quantization in the presence of symmetries. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRFs within the perspective-neutral framework for constrained systems. Concepts from quantum error correction like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups, which possess symmetry groups that are isomorphic to the stabilizer group. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from frame degrees of freedom, relative to which errors corrupt only redundant frame data. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors from the code essentially behave as electric excitations that are exactly dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. We comprehensively illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves manifestly connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. The exploratory investigations in this article pave the way for deeper foundational applications to quantum gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes are prevalent at the centers of massive galaxies, and their masses scale with galaxy properties, increasing evidence suggesting that these trends continue to low stellar masses. Seeds are needed for supermassive black holes, especially at the highest redshifts explored by the James Webb Space Telescope. We study the hierarchical merging of galaxies via cosmological merger trees and argue that the seeds of supermassive black holes formed in nuclear star clusters via stellar black hole mergers at early epochs. Observable tracers include intermediate-mass black holes, nuclear star clusters, and early gas accretion in host dwarf galaxies, along with a potentially detectable stochastic gravitational wave background, ejection of intermediate and supermassive black holes, and consequences of a significant population of tidal disruption events and extreme-mass ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Black Holes as Condensation Points of Fuzzy Dark Matter Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of a Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core condensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic relaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. We show that in general the BH merges with pre-collapsed mini-clusters and once they share location the BH oscillates within the core. The condensation takes place around the black hole and the FDM acquires a density profile consistent with the density of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue problem in average. The central density of the resulting core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its motion relative to the FDM cloud produces a smaller time-averaged densities for bigger BH masses, which lead to a new diversity of central FDM core densities. Our results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM core condensation. As a collateral result, for our analysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and found a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit FDM cores around BHs.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Algebras and states in super-JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bosonic JT gravity, minimally coupled to bulk matter, there exists a single, delta-function-normalisable state in each $SL(2,R)$ representation of the matter QFT for any pair of positive energies $E_L, E_R$ at the left and right boundaries. In $\mathcal{N} = 2$ super-JT gravity coupled to matter, we show that there exists a single normalisable state in each $SU(1,1|1)$ matter representation (given appropriate R-charges) that has exactly zero energy at both boundaries. For non-BPS representations, these states have the peculiar property that they break all supersymmetry in the bulk, while preserving supersymmetry at both boundaries. Projecting the algebras of boundary observables onto these zero-energy states leads to a Type II$_1$ von Neumann factor at each boundary that contains a single operator for each supersymmetric matter boundary primary with sufficiently small R-charge. For neutral boundary primaries, the Type II$_1$ factor has a natural action on the matter QFT Hilbert space (with no additional gravitational degrees of freedom) such that the QFT vacuum is the unique tracial state. Moreover, the product of neutral matter operators can be found very explicitly and has a remarkably simple form. When primaries with nonzero matter R-charge are included, the trace can be written as a sum over matter vacuum expectation values associated to each allowed boundary R-charge $J_R$, with the terms in the sum weighted by $\mathrm{cos}(\pi J_R)$. In this way, the ground state algebras encode the ratios of the number of BPS microstates within each R-charge sector. In addition to the results on super-JT gravity described above, we provide a purely Lorentzian derivation of the algebraic structure of canonically quantised (bosonic) JT gravity plus matter, without appeal to the Euclidean gravitational path integrals used in previous work.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations for the evolution of the order parameter in space and time, such as the Langevin equation. We demonstrate that the ordinary differential equations governing either the temporal or spatial dependence in the Langevin equation provide surprisingly substantial insights into the dynamics of the phase transition. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time, which is crucial to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In particular, Bernoulli differential equations that arise in the overdamped case can be solved analytically. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. Apart from the fundamental insights into the KZM, this finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve with numerical simulations of the full partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at large scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the Sachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the scalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for three-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation in the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and negligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a formulation of black hole thermodynamics that incorporates the notions of heat and work, based on the thermodynamics in quantum theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. First, for coupled holographic CFTs, we define a coarse-graining procedure adopting the principle of maximum entropy. Employing this approach, when the system is divided into a target system and thermal baths, we formulate the first and second laws, as well as the fundamental thermodynamic relation. Then, by translating the resulting thermodynamics into the AdS gravity language, we construct a thermodynamic framework for composite black hole systems that encompasses both heat and work. This formulation relies on holography, but not on energy conditions on the gravity side. We also argue that the second law serves as a necessary criterion for the UV completeness of gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: Plebanski's second heavenly equation reduces the problem of finding a self-dual Einstein metric to solving a non-linear second-order PDE for a single function. Plebanski's original equation is for self-dual metrics obtained as perturbations of the flat metric. Recently, a version of this equation was discovered for self-dual metrics arising as perturbations around a constant curvature background. We provide a new simple derivation of both versions of the Plebanski second heavenly equation. Our derivation relies on the `pure connection' description of self-dual gravity. Our results also suggest a new interpretation to the kinematic algebra of self-dual Yang-Mills theory, as the Lie algebra of (0,1) vector fields on a R4 endowed with a complex structure.</description>

Abstract: Astrometric measurements provide a unique avenue for constraining the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the application of two neural network architectures, a fully connected network and a graph neural network, for analyzing astrometric data to detect the SGWB. Specifically, we generate mock Gaia astrometric measurements of the proper motions of sources and train two networks to predict the energy density of the SGWB, $\Omega_\text{GW}$. We evaluate the performance of both models under varying input datasets to assess their robustness across different configurations. Our results demonstrate that neural networks can effectively measure the SGWB, showing promise as tools for addressing systematic uncertainties and modeling limitations that pose challenges for traditional likelihood-based methods.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <title>Discriminating between different modified dispersion relations from gamma-ray observations</title>

Abstract: The fact that the standard dispersion relation for photons in vacuum could be modified because of their interaction with the quantum nature of spacetime has been proposed more than two decades ago. A quantitative model [Jacob \&amp; Piran, JCAP 01, 031 (2008)], has been tested extensively using distant highly energetic astrophysical sources, searching for energy-dependent time delays in photon arrival times. Since no delay was firmly measured, lower limits were set on the energy scale $\Lambda$ related to these effects. In recent years, however, different but equally well-grounded expressions beyond the Jacob \&amp; Piran model were obtained for the photon dispersion relation, leading to different expressions for the dependence of lag versus redshift. This article introduces a general parameterization of modified dispersion relations in cosmological symmetry, which directly leads to a general parameterized lag versus redshift dependence encompassing both existing and new models. This parameterization could be used in the future to compare the predicted time lags of the different models and test them against observations. To investigate this possibility, realistic data sets are simulated, mimicking different types of extragalactic sources as detected by current and future instruments. When no lag is injected in the simulated data, each lag-redshift model leads, as expected, to a different value for the limit on $\Lambda$, and the Jacob \&amp; Piran model gives the most stringent bound. When a lag at $\Lambda \sim E_P$ in the Jacob \&amp; Piran model is injected, it is detected for all the other lag-redshift relations considered, although leading to different values. Finally, the possibility to discriminate between several lag-redshift models is investigated, emphasizing the importance of an evenly distributed sample of sources across a wide range of redshifts.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to near extremal Kerr thermodynamics from semiclassical Virasoro blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to perform an exact calculation of one-loop quantum corrections to black hole entropy in terms of Virasoro semiclassical blocks. We analyse in detail four-dimensional Kerr black hole and show that in the near-extremal limit a branch of long-lived modes arises. We prove that the contribution of these modes accounts for a $(s-1/2)\log T_{\text{Hawking}}$ correction to the entropy for massless particles of spin $s=1,2$. We show that in the full calculation performed in the exact Kerr background the leading contribution actually is sourced by the near-horizon region only, and as such has a universal validity for any asymptotic behavior at infinity.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Zoom-In Simulations of Milky Way Host Size Dark Matter Halos with a Blue-Tilted Primordial Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope revealed a surprisingly large number of galaxies formed at high redshift. Along with strong lensing studies and nearby galaxy observations, these could challenge the standard Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmology with a power-law primordial power spectrum. In this study, we conduct high-resolution cosmological zoom-in dark matter-only simulations of Milky Way host size halos with a blue, tilted primordial power spectrum ($P(k)\propto k^{m_s}$ with $m_s&gt;1$ at small scales $&gt;1~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$). We find that the blue-tilted subhalo mass functions can be enhanced by more than a factor of two for subhalo masses $M_{\rm sub} \lesssim 10^{10}~ M_{\odot}$, whereas the subhalo $V_{\rm max}$ functions can be enhanced by a factor of four for maximum circular velocities $V_{\rm max}\lesssim 30 ~{\rm km/s}$. The blue-tilted scaled cumulative substructure fraction can be an order of magnitude higher at $\sim$10\% of the virial radius. The blue-tilted subhalos also have higher central densities, since the blue-tilted subhalos reach the same $V_{\rm max}$ at a smaller distance $R_{\rm max}$ from the center. We have also verified these findings with higher-resolution simulations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic T-duality in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In (super)gravity theories, T-duality relates solutions with an exact isometry which can have wildly different asymptotic behaviors: a well-known example is the duality between BTZ black holes and (non-extremal) three-dimensional black strings. Using this dual pair, we show how the knowledge of a phase space which includes one set of solutions (here, BTZ black holes embedded in the Brown-Henneaux phase space) allows to obtain a phase space for the dual set via an asymptotic notion of T-duality. The resulting asymptotic symmetry algebras can be very different. For our particular example, we find a large algebra of symmetries for the black string phase space which includes as subalgebras $\mathfrak{bms}_2$, $\mathfrak{bms}_3$, and a twisted warped conformal algebra. On the way, we show that a chiral half of the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions are dual to the Comp\`ere-Song-Strominger ones.</description>

      <title>Henneaux-Teitelboim Form of the Generalized Unimodular Gravity Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG), extending the Henneaux-Teitelboim approach to unimodular gravity (UMG). The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization, which enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the dynamics of the original formulation. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial nonlocality, and outline the constraint structure. In particular, we show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodular gravity. Furthermore, we identify a subset of GUMG models for which the alternative formulation preserves manifest locality.</description>

      <title>The Classical Super-Rotation Infrared Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of gravitational scattering at low energies and large distances encoded in soft theorems and memory effects can be understood from symmetries. In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite enhancement of translations, extending the Poincar\'e group to the BMS group, is the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the gravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared triangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the soft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the classical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an `infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions is accounted for. Building on earlier results in 2403.13053 where we derived a novel conservation law associated to the infinite dimensional enhancement of Lorentz transformations to superrotations, we prove here its validity to all orders in the gravitational coupling and show that it implies the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Saha-Sahoo-Sen in 1912.06413. We furthermore extend the formula for the displacement memory and its tail from particles to fields, thus completing the classical superrotation infrared triangle.</description>

      <title>Sound Speed Resonance of Gravitational Waves in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the occurrence of Sound Speed Resonances (SSR) in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation across a wide range of coupling functions and parameters. After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its potential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor modes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton stabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed of light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed oscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a distinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that these GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\textbf{SKA}$, $\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second inflationary phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell-network states are a class of entangled states of the geometry that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in a limit of large spins and are automorphism-invariant, for arbitrary graphs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. Our main goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory. We found that the average geometry at each node in the dipole graph does not match that of a flat tetrahedron. Instead, the expected values of the geometric observables satisfy relations that are characteristic of spherical tetrahedra. The mean geometry is accompanied by fluctuations with considerable relative dispersion for the dihedral angle, and perfectly correlated for the two nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One parameter family of exact solutions in General Relativity with a scalar field has been found using the Liouville metric. The scalar field potential has exponential form. This model is interesting, because, in particular, the solution corresponding to the naked singularity provides smooth extension of the Friedmann universe with accelerated expansion through the zero of the scale factor back in time. All geodesics are found explicitly. Their analysis shows that the Liouville solutions are global ones: every geodesic is either continued to infinite value of the canonical parameter in both directions or ends up at the singularity at its finite value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use numerical relativity to study the spin induction effect within close hyperbolic encounters of initially spinning black holes. We review the initially non-spinning case and explore the cases of initially aligned, anti-aligned and orthogonal spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum $\vec L$. We find that, for a given initial effective spin, the black hole with a smaller initial spin acquires a greater spin-up than the other black hole after the interaction. We study three different scenarios regarding initial effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}=-0.1, \ 0.0, \ 0.1$), using three different scattering angles in order to obtain maximally spin-inducing scenarios. We also find that the final effective spin-ups with respect to the initial spins are well-fitted by a parabola. For spins orthogonal to $\vec L$, we observe that the black hole spins precess, and that the induced spin in the $z$-direction depends quadratically on the value of the initial spins. These phenomena suggest that dense black hole clusters present a rich spin dynamics, where black hole spins may acquire non-trivial distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expansion of the universe is caused by the departure from the holographic equipartition. This principle, the law of emergence, first postulated in the context of Einstein's gravity has been extended successfully to more general gravity theories like Gauss-Bonnet and Lovelock gravity. We derive the law of emergence for braneworld models of gravity, starting from the more fundamental and well established principle, the first law of thermodynamics. More specifically, we derive the law of emergence in the context of RS II braneworld, Warped DGP model and Gauss-Bonnet braneworld and compare the derived law with the one proposed by Sheykhi for the braneworld models. We further show that the law of emergence leads to the maximization of horizon entropy in all these braneworld models. While the law of emergence effectively implies the maximization of horizon entropy, it could be derived from the first law of thermodynamics. Our results suggest that the horizon thermodynamics is the backbone of the law of emergence in the braneworld scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalar quasinormal modes in emergent modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergent modified gravity is a post-Einsteinian gravitational theory where spacetime geometry is not fundamental but rather emerges from the gravitational degrees of freedom in a non-trivial way. The specific relationship between geometry and these degrees of freedom is unique for each theory, but it is not predetermined. Instead, it is derived from constraints and equations of motion, relying on key aspects of the canonical formulation of gravity, such as structure functions in Poisson brackets of constraints and covariance conditions. As shown in previous work, these new theories allow for two types of scalar matter coupling: (1) minimal coupling, where the matter equations of motion mirror the Klein-Gordon equation on a curved emergent spacetime, and (2) nonminimal coupling, where the equations deviate from the Klein-Gordon form but still respect covariance. Observable features, such as the quasinormal mode spectrum, can help distinguish between different couplings based on how well their predictions match the data. In this work, the spectra of scalar quasinormal modes for both minimal and nonminimal couplings are derived using the third-order WKB approximation. Significant differences are found between the two cases. Notably, the nonminimal coupling allows for vanishing real and imaginary frequency components, and even opposite-sign values for the imaginary part at sufficiently small mass scales, pointing to potential new physical implications. Finally, the high-frequency QNM spectra in emergent modified gravity is identical to the classical result, up to an overall constant, suggesting that the horizon area spectrum remains equispaced.</description>

      <title>Mitigating cosmic variance in the Hellings-Downs curve: a Cosmic Microwave Background analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hellings-Downs (HD) correlation, which characterizes the signature of a stochastic gravitational wave background measured via Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), is derived using a harmonic formalism. This approach closely follows the theoretical framework traditionally employed to compute correlations of temperature fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). This parallel enables a direct comparison between the correlations observed in PTA and those in CMB experiments. After providing analytic estimates of the transmission functions due to the model-fitting procedure, we show that the covariance matrix in frequency space becomes very non-diagonal. We then build formally the quadratic estimator for the HD correlation in multipolar space, for both perfect and imperfect experiments. In particular, we clarify that what has been referred to as \emph{cosmic variance} in some of the previous literature is not an intrinsic limitation for PTA measurements. Instead, when an optimal estimator is used, this variance can be mitigated by accumulating more observation time or improving the cadence of pulsar monitoring. Therefore, unlike CMB angular correlations, where cosmic variance represents an irreducible constraint, it can be reduced in PTA measurements and will continue to diminish in future experiments. Finally, we show that if the primordial power spectrum of tensor fluctuations was very blue with $n_T&gt;4$, the CMB angular correlation due to these tensor modes would also exhibit a HD correlation.</description>

Abstract: The boundary structure of $3+1$-dimensional gravity (in the Palatini-Cartan formalism) coupled to to gauge (Yang-Mills) and matter (scalar and spinorial) fields is described through the use of the Kijowski-Tulczijew construction. In particular, the reduced phase space is obtained as the reduction of a symplectic space by some first class constraints and a cohomological description (BFV) of it is presented.</description>

Abstract: Placing a black hole in a cavity provides a natural framework for exploring gravitational scales, thermodynamic instabilities, and effective gravity theories. In this paper, we examine the evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in a two-sided extension of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. By introducing a reflecting boundary in the eternal black hole exteriors, we regulate the infrared modes of Hawking radiation, finding that the entanglement entropy eventually saturates at a constant value. This value can be lower than the black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus avoiding the Page formulation of the information paradox. Regarding entanglement islands, we identify a universal effect induced by the boundary, which we term the ``blinking island'' -- where the entanglement island temporarily disappears, resulting in a short-time information paradox.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature renormalization of Standard Model coupled with gravity, and its implications for cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07335v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metric, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the renormalization analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <title>STOLAS: STOchastic LAttice Simulation of cosmic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

      <title>A field-level emulator for modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stage IV surveys like LSST and Euclid present a unique opportunity to shed light on the nature of dark energy. However, their full constraining power cannot be unlocked unless accurate predictions are available at all observable scales. Currently, only the linear regime is well understood in models beyond $\Lambda$CDM: on the nonlinear scales, expensive numerical simulations become necessary, whose direct use is impractical in the analyses of large datasets. Recently, machine learning techniques have shown the potential to break this impasse: by training emulators, we can predict complex data fields in a fraction of the time it takes to produce them.
  In this work, we present a field-level emulator capable of turning a $\Lambda$CDM N-body simulation into one evolved under $f(R)$ gravity. To achieve this, we build on the map2map neural network, using the strength of modified gravity $|f_{R_0}|$ as style parameter. We find that our emulator correctly estimates the changes it needs to apply to the positions and velocities of the input N-body particles to produce the target simulation.
  We test the performance of our network against several summary statistics, finding $1\%$ agreement in the power spectrum up to $k \sim 1$ $h/$Mpc, and $1.5\%$ agreement against the independent boost emulator eMantis. Although the algorithm is trained on fixed cosmological parameters, we find it can extrapolate to models it was not trained on. Coupled with available field-level emulators and simulation suites for $\Lambda$CDM, our algorithm can be used to constrain modified gravity in the large-scale structure using full information available at the field level.</description>

      <title>Celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ charges from a twistor action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in asymptotically flat spacetimes have a natural geometric interpretation on twistor space in terms of Poisson diffeomorphisms. Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation of the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the Poisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as surface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null infinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at $\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi identities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by showing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.</description>

      <title>NUTs, Bolts, and Spindles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct new infinite classes of Euclidean supersymmetric solutions of four dimensional minimal gauged supergravity comprising a $U (1) \times U (1)$-invariant asymptotically locally hyperbolic metric on the total space of orbifold line bundles over a spindle (bolt). The conformal boundary is generically a squashed, branched, lens space and the graviphoton gauge field can have either twist or anti-twist through the spindle bolt. Correspondingly, the boundary geometry inherits two types of rigid Killing spinors, that we refer to as twist and anti-twist for the three-dimensional Seifert orbifolds, as well as some specific flat connections for the background gauge field, determined by the data of the spindle bolt. For all our solutions we compute the holographically renormalized on-shell action and compare it to the expression obtained via equivariant localization, uncovering a markedly distinct behaviour in the cases of twist and anti twist. Our results provide precise predictions for the large $N$ limit of the corresponding localized partition functions of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories placed on Seifert orbifolds.</description>
