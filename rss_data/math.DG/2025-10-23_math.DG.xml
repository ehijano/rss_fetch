      <title>Embedded convex surfaces in hyperbolic and anti-de Sitter spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that given a quasi-circle $C$ in $\partial_{\infty}\mathbb{H}^3$ (respectively in $\partial_{\infty} \mathbb{ADS}^3$) and a complete conformal metric $h$ on $\mathbb{D}$ whose curvature $K_h$ takes values in a compact subset of $(-1,0)$ (respectively $(-\infty,-1)$), with all derivatives bounded with respect to the hyperbolic metric, there exists a smooth isometric embedding $V : (\mathbb{D}, h) \to \mathbb{H}^3$ (respectively $V : (\mathbb{D}, h) \to \mathbb{ADS}^3$) such that $V$ extends continuously to a homeomorphism $\partial V : \partial_{\infty}\mathbb{H}^2 \to C$. In the case of hyperbolic space, the statement still holds if $C$ is a Jordan curve.</description>

      <title>Strong uniqueness of tangent flows at cylindrical singularities in Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a Lojasiewicz inequality for the pointed $\mathcal{W}$-entropy in the Ricci flow, under the assumption that the geometry near the base point is close to a standard cylinder $\mathbb{R}^k \times S^{n-k}$ or the quotient thereof. As an application, we prove the strong uniqueness of the cylindrical tangent flow at the first singular time of the Ricci flow. Specifically, we show that the modified Ricci flow near the singularity converges to the cylindrical model under a fixed gauge.</description>

      <title>Winding and focussing for geodesics passing a thin cuspidal neck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study geodesics on a family $(M_\varepsilon)$ of manifolds that have a thin neck, which degenerate to a space with an incomplete cuspidal singularity as $\varepsilon\to0$. There are essentially two classes of geodesics passing the waist, i.e. the cross section where the neck is thinnest: 1. Those hitting the waist almost vertically. We find that these exhibit a surprising focussing phenomenon as $\varepsilon\to0$: certain exit directions will be preferred, for a generic limiting singularity. 2. Those hitting the waist obliquely at a uniformly non-vertical angle. They wind around the neck more and more as $\varepsilon\to0$. We give a precise quantitative description of this winding. We illustrate both phenomena by numerical solutions. Our results rest on a detailed analysis at the two relevant scales: the points whose distance to the waist is of order $\varepsilon$, and those much farther away. This multiscale analysis is efficiently expressed in terms of blow-up.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Vn-slant helices and the harmonic curvature functions of Vn-slant helices are de ned in lightlike cone Qn+1, and the differential equations of the harmonic curvature functions Hi, 1&lt;i&lt;n-2 of Vn-slant helices are expressed by using constant vector field W that is the axis of Vn slant helices. Also, the necessary and sufficient conditions are given according to the condition of being Vn-slant helices by using the asymptotic orthonormal frame in Qn+1.</description>

      <title>Poisson structures on weak Sobolev loop spaces and applications to integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for Poisson geometry on loop spaces of low regularity, extending Mokhov's classical constructions from smooth loops to weak Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{S^1},\mathbb{R}^m)$ with $o &lt; s \frac{1}{2}$ and $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty.$ Within this setting we construct presymplectic and Poisson structures of hydrodynamic type, as well as their weakly non local deformations involving inverse derivatives. The analytic backbone relies on the boundedness of fractional multipliers, Hilbert transforms, and Lipschitz Nemytski operators on $W^{s,p}$, which ensures that all operations used in Mokhov's formalisn remain well defined at this level of regularity. We further show that teh horizontal-vertical bicomplex underlying variational Poisson geometry can be extended to $W^{s,p},$ so that the cohomological arguments proving skew-symmetry and the Jacobi identity carry over verbatim. As an application, we embed the Hamiltonian formalisms of several integrable PDEs (KdV, nonlinear Schr\"odinger, Camassa--Holm, and hydrodynamic systems of Dubrovin--Novikov type) into this weak Sobolev setting. Local order-one Poisson operators and their weakly nonlocal extensions are shown to be well posed for $W^{s,p}$ loops, while higher-order operators (e.g. the second KdV bracket) require stronger regularity. Our results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for Poisson geometry on weak loop spaces and open the way for extending the Hamiltonian theory of integrable systems beyond the smooth category.</description>

      <title>Geometric Interpretation of Brownian Motion on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified geometric framework for Brownian motion on manifolds, encompassing intrinsic Riemannian manifolds, embedded submanifolds, and Lie groups. The approach constructs the stochastic differential equation by injecting noise along each axis of an orthonormal frame and designing the drift term so that the resulting generator coincides with the Laplace--Beltrami operator. Both Stratonovich and It\^{o} formulations are derived explicitly, revealing the geometric origin of curvature-induced drift. The drift is shown to correspond to the covariant derivatives of the frame fields for intrinsic manifolds, the mean curvature vector for embedded manifolds, and the adjoint-trace term for Lie groups, which vanishes for unimodular cases. The proposed formulation provides a geometrically transparent and mathematically consistent foundation for diffusion processes on nonlinear configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Abelian instances of nonabelian symplectic reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a Lie group $\mathbb{G}$ with a normal abelian subgroup $\mathbb{A}$. Suppose that $\mathbb{G}$ acts on a Hamiltonian fashion on a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. Such action can be restricted to a Hamiltonian action of $\mathbb{A}$ on $M$. This work investigates the conditions under which the (generally nonabelian) symplectic reduction of $M$ by $\mathbb{G}$ is equivalent to the (abelian) symplectic reduction of $M$ by $\mathbb{A}$. While the requirement that the symplectically reduced spaces share the same dimension is evidently necessary, we prove that it is, in fact, sufficient. We then provide classess of examples where such equivalence holds for generic momentum values. These examples include certain semi-direct products and a large family of nilpotent groups which includes some classical Carnot groups, like the Heisenberg group and the jet space $\mathcal{J}^k(\mathbb{R}^n,\mathbb{R}^m)$.</description>

      <title>Optimal quantitative stability estimates for Alexandrov's Soap Bubble Theorem via Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type interpolation inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper provides optimal quantitative stability estimates for the celebrated Alexandrov's Soap Bubble Theorem within the class of $C^{k,\alpha}$ domains, for any $k \ge 1$ and $0 &lt; \alpha \le 1$, by leveraging Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type interpolation inequalities.
  Optimal estimates of uniform closeness to a ball are established for $L^r$ deviations of the mean curvature from being constant, for any $r\ge 2$ (more generally, for any $r&gt;1$ such that $r\ge (2N-2)/(N+1)$).
  For $r&gt;\frac{N-1}{2}$, the stability profile is linear, thus returning the existing results established in the literature through computations for nearly spherical sets. Surprisingly, all the stability estimates for $r\ge \frac{N-1}{2}$, for which the profile is not linear, are new; even in the particular case $r=2$ (which has been extensively studied, since it is a case of interest for several critical applications), the sharp stability profile that we obtain is new. Interestingly, we also prove that the (non-linear) profile for $r \ge \frac{N-1}{2}$ improves as $k$ becomes larger to such an extent that it becomes formally linear as $k$ goes to $\infty$.
  Finally, for any $r$, we show that all our estimates are optimal for any $k \ge 1$ and $0&lt; \alpha \le 1$, by providing explicit examples.</description>

      <title>H\"older Regularity of Distributional Volume Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f, g^1, \dots, g^d : \mathbb{R}^d \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be H\"older continuous functions. If the H\"older exponents of these functions are less than $1$ but sufficiently large, we use the integral introduced by Z\"ust to construct a distribution, denoted by $f \, \mathrm{d}g^1 \wedge \dots \wedge \, \mathrm{d}g^d$ which depends continuously on the functions $f, g^1, \dots, g^d$ in a sense that we shall specify, and which coincides with the function $f\det(\, \mathrm{d} g)$ when the functions $g^i$ are Lipschitz. We show that this distribution is entirely characterized by these properties and determine its H\"older regularity. We use this distribution to define the integral $ \int_{\Omega} f \, \mathrm{d}g^1 \wedge \dots \wedge \, \mathrm{d}g^d$ by duality, for general domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. When $\Omega$ is a rectangle, this integral coincides with Z\"ust's construction. We then establish a new criterion on the domain $\Omega$ ensuring that the integral is well defined. This criterion allows to recover a condition of Bouafia on the perimeter of the domain, and in the case when $d = 2$, the condition of Alberti-Stepanov-Trevisan on the upper box dimension of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Non-optimal domains for the helicity maximisation problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [J. Cantarella, D. DeTurck, H. Gluck and M. Teytel, J. Math. Phys. 41:5615 (2000)] the helicity isoperimetric problem which asks to find a smooth domain of fixed volume which maximises Biot-Savart helicity among all other smooth domains of fixed volume was initiated. It was shown that if an optimal domain exists, all of its boundary components must be tori.
  The present work extends these results by establishing additional geometric constraints which optimal domains, if they exist, must satisfy. This allows to rule out the optimality of a broad class of solid tori. The existence of optimal domains remains an open problem.</description>

      <title>Riemannian metric representatives of the Stiefel-Whitney classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.05719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $M$ is a closed manifold, and $K$ is a smooth triangulation of $M$, Whitney proved that all of the Stiefel-Whitney classes are specified as cochains on the dual cell complex $(K')^*$ assigning the value $1$ mod $2$ to each dual cell. We provide the pair $(M,K)$ with an arbitrary Riemannian metric $g$, and use Whitney's criteria to show that there are associated representatives of all the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1(M), \ldots , w_n(M)$. The representative of $w_1(M)$ is determined by $\det{g_{ij}}$, the $g_{ij}$s computed in a frame that is locally defined at each dual $1$-cell; the representatives of the even classes $w_{2k}(M)$ are determined by the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet density $2k$-form of locally defined totally geodesic oriented $2k$ manifolds with boundary associated to each dual $2k$-cell; and the representatives of the odd classes $w_{2k+1}(M)$ are determined by the hypersurface area form of the boundary sphere of a locally defined totally geodesic oriented $(2k+1)$ manifold with boundary associated to each dual $(2k+1)$-cell. If $(M,J,g)$ is Hermitian, we prove that the metric representative of $w_{2k}(M)$ so obtained is the $\mathbb{Z}/2$ reduction of the $k$-th Chern class $c_k(M,J)$ induced by the coefficient homomorphism, and that the metric representative of any odd degree class $w_{2k+1}(M)$ so obtained is trivial in cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Newton's method for finding zeros of mappings from a manifold $\mathcal X$ into a vector bundle $\mathcal E$. In this setting a connection on $\mathcal E$ is required to render the Newton equation well defined, and a retraction on $\mathcal X$ is needed to compute a Newton update. We discuss local convergence in terms of suitable differentiability concepts, using a Banach space variant of a Riemannian distance. We also carry over an affine covariant damping strategy to our setting. Finally, we will illustrate our results by applying them to generalized non-symmetric eigenvalue problems and providing a numerical example.</description>

In the course of our proof, we find a criterion for uniform convergence of solutions to the heat equation along a sequence of $\mathbb{F}$-converging Ricci flows, and apply this to new parabolic regularizations of some natural geometric quantities.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity One Expanding Ricci Solitons and the Expander Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the space of smooth gradient expanding Ricci soliton structures on $S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^3$ and $S^2 \times \mathbb{R}^2$ which are invariant under the action of $\text{SO}(3) \times \text{SO}(2)$. In the case of each topology, there exists a $2$-parameter family of cohomogeneity one solitons asymptotic to cones over the link $S^2 \times S^1$, as constructed by Nienhaus-Wink and Buzano-Dancer-Gallaugher-Wang. By analyzing the resultant soliton ODEs, we reconstruct the $2$-parameter families in each case and provide an alternate proof of conicality. Analogous to work of Bamler and Chen, we define a notion of expander degree for these cohomogeneity one solitons through a properness result. We then proceed to calculate this cohomogeneity one expander degree in the cases of the specific topologies.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\rm k}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $G$ a connect, reductive group over it. Let $X$ be a projective $G$-variety of complexity 1. We classify $G$-equivariant normal test configurations of $X$ with integral central fibre via the combinatorial data. We also give a formula of anti-canonical divisors on $X$. Based on this formula, when $X$ is $\mathbb Q$-Fano, we give an expression of the Futaki invariant, and derive a criterion of uniform K-stability in terms of the combinatorial data.</description>
