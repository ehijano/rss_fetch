      <title>Data-Driven Model for Elastomers under Simultaneous Thermal and Radiation Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed neural network framework for predicting the mechanical performance of elastomers exposed to concurrent thermal and gamma-radiation exposure, such as elastomers in nuclear cables or space electronics. Our demonstrated approach integrates the dual-network hypothesis with the microsphere concept to represent soft and brittle sub-networks, while embedding physical laws directly into the machine learning process.
  Hard constraints, e.g., incompressibility, bounded network fractions are enforced through network architecture, and soft constraints e.g., monotonicity, polyconvexity, and fading effects are imposed through the loss function. This integration reduces the effective search space, guiding the optimization toward physically admissible solutions and enhancing robustness under sparse data. Validation against published datasets on silicone rubber, ethylene propylene diene monomer, and silica-reinforced silicone foam shows accurate predictions of stress-strain behavior and elongation-at-break at exposure times not used for training. Results confirm that physics-informed constraints improve extrapolation, capture synergistic thermal-radiation effects, and provide a reliable tool for lifetime assessment of nuclear cable insulation and other radiation-exposed elastomers.</description>

      <title>Dual-moon forced dynamics and nonlinear aggregation in Saturn's F ring: From quasi-periodicity to modulated oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a minimal nonlinear model to investigate the oscillatory dynamics of Saturn's F ring under dual-moon forcing from Prometheus and Pandora. The model extends classical predator--prey dynamics by incorporating both a nonlinear mass aggregation term $kM^n$ and explicit dual-frequency forcing, capturing how higher-order coagulation physics interacts with multi-moon perturbations. Through extensive numerical integration and dynamical systems analysis, including time-series, spectral, stroboscopic mapping, and rotation number diagnostics, we identify distinct dynamical regimes controlled by the parameters $n$ and $k$.
  For moderate nonlinearity $(n=1.28, k=0.54)$, the system exhibits regular quasi-periodic motion on a two-torus, characterized by smooth amplitude modulation and discrete spectral lines. As nonlinearity increases $(n=1.30, k=0.62)$, the dynamics transition to strongly modulated oscillations with intermittent phase slips, broadened Poincar\'e bands, and sideband-rich spectra. A rotation number heatmap reveals organized structures in parameter space, with smooth quasi-periodic regions bounded by near-locking bands analogous to Arnold tongues.
  Our results demonstrate that the F ring's complex morphology can emerge from deterministic multi-frequency dynamics rather than stochastic processes, with the system operating near critical boundaries where small parameter variations can trigger macroscopic reorganization. The model provides a framework for understanding pattern formation in other driven granular systems while offering testable predictions for ring observations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the possibility of applying stochastic quantum mechanics to curved spacetimes, with an emphasis on the Schwarzschild black hole. After reviewing the fundamental concepts of this approach, the quantum stochastic equations are extended to curved spacetime using a fully covariant treatment. Subsequently, the Klein-Gordon equation is solved for scalar perturbations, and the resulting stochastic trajectories are analyzed by varying parameters such as angular momentum, particle frequency, and computational integration time. In conclusion, we find that the trajectories are influenced by gravitational fluctuations in spacetime and that, depending on the variation of the fundamental parameters, different types of stochastic trajectories are obtained.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of three-dimensional (3D) spinless fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional (3D) Ising model is mapped into a 3D spinless fermionic model by the Jordan-Wigner transformation. The exact solution of the 3D model for spinless fermions is derived analytically by performing a diagonalization process consisting of the Clifford algebraic approach, the Fourier transformation and the Bogoliubov transformation. The Clifford algebraic approach is the same as that developed for the 3D Ising model, using a time average within the Jordan-von Neumann-Wigner framework, a linearization procedure and a local gauge transformation. The formulas for eigenvalues, partition function, subsequent thermodynamic properties and critical behaviors are presented. The dimensionality and the topological phases are investigated. The present results for many spinless fermions in a 3D lattice are applicable for studying the mechanisms of magnetism, superfluid, superconductors and topological materials.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis constraints and parameter bounds in $f(T,T_{G})$ modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe within the framework of $f(T,T_{G})$ gravity, where $T$ is the torsion scalar and $T_{G}$ denotes its teleparallel Gauss--Bonnet counterpart. Two illustrative models, $f(T,T_{G})=\alpha T+\beta \sqrt{T_{G}}$ and $f(T,T_{G})=-T+\delta\, T_{G}\ln(T_{G})$, are examined in a power-law background $a(t)=a_{0} t^{m}$. For both models, we derive analytic expressions for the baryon-to-entropy ratio $\eta_{B}/s$ using the standard and generalized baryogenesis formalisms, adopting high-energy decoupling conditions with $g_{b}=1$, $g_{s}=106$, $T_{D}=2\times10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, and $M_{\star}=2\times10^{12}\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Consistency of the cosmological dynamics requires $m&gt;1$, and the observed value $\eta_{B}/s \simeq 9.42\times10^{-11}$ is obtained for constrained intervals of the parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, and $m$. Numerical results confirm that both models reproduce the measured baryon asymmetry without invoking extra fields or exotic matter sources. These findings indicate that teleparallel gravity with a Gauss--Bonnet torsion term provides a natural and viable mechanism for baryogenesis, offering a compelling alternative to curvature-based descriptions of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Clock Paradox in Chukchi Myth and the Teaching of Special Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The teaching of special relativity still follows Einstein's original two-postulate approach and thus recreates the relativistic revolution in the minds of students again and again, with all its attendant shocking and mysterious aspects. As Hermann Bondi long ago noted, such an approach, which emphasizes the revolutionary aspects of a theory rather than its continuity with earlier thought, "is hardly conducive to easy teaching and good understanding". But what could be a better alternative? In 1923, the distinguished Russian ethnographer, linguist, and anthropologist Tan-Bogoraz described the striking similarities between the special theory of relativity and the mythology of Chukchi shamans. Inspired by this surprising observation, I assume that the basic concepts of relativity are not at all alien to our innate perception of time and space, and I propose an approach to the foundations of relativity that emphasizes absolute concepts such as proper time and causal cones rather than relative ones.</description>

      <title>A formalism of Gravitation based on a Physical Field Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reformulation of gravitation in which the gravitational interaction is treated as a genuine force rather than an inertial effect arising from spacetime geometry. Within this framework, the difference between the affine connection and a flat reference connection defines a tensor $\mathrm{K}^\mu{}_{\alpha\beta}$, identified as the gravitational field strength. This object cannot be eliminated by coordinate transformations, demonstrating that gravity possesses true physical degrees of freedom. The formalism introduces vector fields $\xi_a{}^\mu$ that extend the notion of infinitesimal translations to curved spacetime and naturally yield a gauge-invariant field strength $\mathfrak{F}^{\xi a}{}_{\mu\nu}$. The dynamics of the gravitational field are governed by a Lagrangian of Yang--Mills type with an additional scalar degree of freedom $\phi^{2}$, corresponding to the Newtonian potential. In the limit of vanishing gravitational coupling $\mathfrak{g}\to0$, the theory reduces to General Relativity, while for nonzero $\mathfrak{g}$ it constitutes an $\mathrm{SU(2)\times U(1)}$ gauge theory of gravity. The framework provides a unified description in which dark energy emerges as the self-interaction energy of the $\phi$ field, and dark-matter-like effects arise from the extended gravitational degrees of freedom. This formulation offers a consistent bridge between classical and quantum descriptions of gravity and clarifies the conceptual foundations of the gravitational interaction.</description>

      <title>Against the point-like nature of the electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experts in quantum field theory (QFT) generally answer the question of the ``size of an electron'' with ``point-like''. On the other hand, QFT recognizes quantum effects, shielding by virtual particles, the so-called polarization cloud, which should describe the size of physical electrons. Scattering experiments with electrons, such as those carried out in high-energy experiments at particle accelerators, should be able to clarify whether physical electrons are really point-like, as claimed by experts and in textbooks. In this article, I show that both the formulas of QFT and the corresponding cross sections are consistent with an extent of the electron of the size of the classical electron radius. The assumption that the relativistic energy of electrons in the high-energy limit consists solely of deformation energy from the extended electron density distribution allows for a simple interpretation of the experimental cross sections. For this reason, I refer to classical models in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions that have precisely this property. The difference between the terms point-like, structureless, and substructureless is highlighted. The usual objections to the claim that the electron radius is finite and has already been measured in electron scattering experiments are discussed.</description>

      <title>A new theory of tensor-scalar gravity coupled to Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor-scalar theories of gravitation are commonly employed as extensions of General Relativity that allow to describe a much wider phenomenology. They are also naturally generated as low energy limit of higher-dimensional or unified theories, and the gravitational scalar components can represent quantum corrections to the Einstein theory. The coupling of the scalars to an e.m. field does not introduce any relevant new physics if the e.m. action has the usual Maxwell form, implying a vanishing trace of the e.m. energy-momentum tensor. In the case of the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics some interesting new situations are possible, which in this work are analyzed in the gravitational weak-field approximation and for a basic version of tensor-scalar gravity involving only a Brans-Dicke field plus another scalar. Since the Aharonov-Bohm theory differs from Maxwell theory only in the presence of anomalous sources with local violation of charge conservation, which is thought to be possible only at a quantum level, the resulting formal framework can be useful to model interactions between gravitation and physical systems with macroscopic quantization. The theory contains some unknown parameters, the most important being the VEV $\psi_0$ of the second gravitational scalar and the level $\gamma$ of violation of local charge conservation in the e.m. sector. An attempt is done to relate these parameters to some experimental constraints. However, there is presently much space left for uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Non-Gravitational Acceleration in 3I ATLAS: Constraints on Exotic Volatile Outgassing in Interstellar Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS displayed a small but statistically significant non-gravitational acceleration during its passage through the inner Solar System. Using a thermophysical model coupled with stochastic sampling of jet configurations, we investigate whether standard volatile-driven activity can account for the observed acceleration. The model includes diurnal and obliquity-averaged energy balance, empirical vapour-pressure relations, and collimated outflow from localized active areas. We find that CO-dominated activity can reproduce the magnitude of the acceleration inferred from the Marsden non-gravitational parameters for nucleus radii between 0.5 and 3 km with active-area fractions that are substantial but thermodynamically plausible. Less volatile species, including NH_3 and CH_4, contribute less efficiently and cannot provide the required recoil when acting alone, while CO_2 remains radiatively dominated and dynamically ineffective over the heliocentric-distance range relevant to the observations. These results show that the measured acceleration of 3I/ATLAS is consistent with ordinary CO-driven outgassing and does not require unusual physical properties. The analysis delineates the thermophysical conditions under which interstellar comets can exhibit measurable deviations from purely gravitational motion.</description>
