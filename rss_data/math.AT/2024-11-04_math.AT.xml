      <title>$C_{p^n}$-Mahowald invariants and $v_{1,\vec{0}}$-self maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $C_{p^n}$-Mahowald invariant: a relation $\pi_\star S_{C_{p^{n-1}}} \rightharpoonup \pi_\ast S$ between the equivariant and classical stable stems which reduces to the classical Mahowald invariant when $n=1$. We compute the $C_{p^n}$-Mahowald invariants of all elements in the Burnside ring $A(C_{p^{n-1}}) = \pi_0 S_{C_{p^{n-1}}}$, extending Mahowald and Ravenel's computation of $M_{C_p}(p^k)$. As a consequence, we determine the image of the $C_p$-geometric fixed point map $\Phi^{C_p} : \pi_V S_{C_{p^n}} \to \pi_0 S_{C_{p^n}/C_p} \cong A(C_{p^{n-1}})$ when $V$ is fixed point free, extending classical theorems of Bredon, Landweber, and Iriye for $n=1$.
  Our work makes essential use of equivariant $K$-theory, and exhibits patterns suggesting an equivariant Adams periodicity. We refine this to produce equivariant lifts of Adams' $v_1$-self maps on Moore spectra. Given a cyclic $p$-group or generalized quaternion group $G$, fixed point free $G$-representation $V$, and element $X\in A(G)$, subject to constraints depending only on the sizes of $G$, $X$, and $V$, we construct a map $\Sigma^V C(X)_{(p)} \to C(X)_{(p)}$ on the cofiber of $X$ which induces an equivalence in $G$-equivariant $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Differential Calculus and Optimization in Persistence Module Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistence modules are representations of products of totally ordered sets in the category of vector spaces. They appear naturally in the representation theory of algebras, but in recent years they have also found applications in other areas of mathematics, including symplectic topology, complex analysis, and topological data analysis, where they arise from filtrations of topological spaces by the sublevel sets of real-valued functions. Two fundamental properties of persistence modules make them useful in such contexts: (1) the fact that they are stable under perturbations of the originating functions, and (2) the fact that they can be approximated, in the sense of relative homological algebra, by classes of indecomposable modules with an elementary structure. In this text we give an introduction to the theory of persistence modules, then we explain how the above properties can be leveraged to build a framework for differential calculus and optimization with convergence guarantees in persistence module categories.</description>

      <title>Topological complexity of enumerative problems and classifying spaces of $PU_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the topological complexity, in the sense of Smale, of three enumerative problems in algebraic geometry: finding the 27 lines on cubic surfaces, the 28 bitangents and the 24 inflection points on quartic curves. In particular, we prove lower bounds for the topological complexity of any algorithm that finds solutions to the three problems and for the Schwarz genera of their associated covers. The key is to understand cohomology classes of the classifying spaces of projective unitary groups $PU_n$.</description>

      <title>Topological QBits in Flux-Quantized Super-Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first give a brief exposition of our recent realization of anyonic quantum states on single M5-brane probes in 11D super-gravity backgrounds, by non-perturbative quantization of the topological sector of the self-dual tensor field on the 6D worldvolume, after its proper flux-quantization. This opens the prospect of holographic models for topological qbits away from the usual but unrealistic limit of large numbers of branes.
  At the same time, the elementary homotopy-theoretic nature of the construction yields a slick expression of topological quantum gates in homotopically-typed programming languages, opening the prospect of topological-hardware aware quantum programming.
  In view of these results, we end with some more meta-physical remarks on (cohesive) homotopy (type) theory in view of emergent fundamental physics and, possibly, M-theory.</description>

      <title>On Fixed-Point Sets of $\Z_2$-Tori in Positive Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work of Kennard, Khalili Samani, and the last author, they generalize the Half-Maximal Symmetry Rank result of Wilking for torus actions on positively curved manifolds to $\mathbb{Z}_2$-tori with a fixed point. They show that if the rank is approximately one-fourth of the dimension of the manifold, then fixed point set components of small co-rank subgroups of the $\Z_2$-torus are homotopy equivalent to spheres, real projective spaces, complex projective spaces, or lens spaces. In this paper, we lower the bound on the rank of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torus to approximately $n/6$ and $n/8$ and are able to classify either the integral cohomology ring or the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-cohomology ring, respectively, of the fixed point set of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torus.</description>

      <title>The Disc-structure space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Disc-structure space $S^{\rm Disc}_\partial(M)$ of a compact smooth manifold $M$. Informally speaking, this space measures the difference between $M$, together with its diffeomorphisms, and the diagram of ordered framed configuration spaces of $M$ with point-forgetting and point-splitting maps between them, together with its derived automorphisms. As the main results, we show that in high dimensions, the Disc-structure space a) only depends on the tangential 2-type of $M$, b) is an infinite loop space, and c) is nontrivial as long as $M$ is spin. The proofs involve intermediate results that may be of independent interest, including an enhancement of embedding calculus to the level of bordism categories, results on the behaviour of derived mapping spaces between operads under rationalisation, and an answer to a question of Dwyer and Hess in that we show that the map ${\rm BTop}(d)\to {\rm BAut}(E_d)$ is an equivalence if and only if $d$ is at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Sharpness for the Benson-Solomon fusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop tools to prove D\'iaz and Park's sharpness conjecture (see [8]) for fusion systems admitting tame families of fusion subsystems (see Theorem A). We use such tools to prove the conjecture for all Benson-Solomon fusion systems (see Theorem B) thus completing the work started by Henke, Libman and Lynd in [14, Theorems 1.1 and 1.4].</description>

      <title>Isotopy classification of Morse polynomials of degree 3 in ${\mathbb R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enumerate all isotopy classes of Morse polynomials ${\mathbb R}^3 \to {\mathbb R}^1$ of degree 3 with non-degenerate principal homogeneous part, in particular prove that there are exactly 37 of them. These results are obtained with the help of a combinatorial computer program formalizing Morse surgeries, local monodromy and the Picard-Lefschetz theory, which I hereby promote and recommend to the readers.</description>

      <title>Relative cell complexes in closure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13227v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give necessary and sufficient conditions for certain pushouts of topological spaces in the category of Cech's closure spaces to agree with their pushout in the category of topological spaces. We prove that in these two categories, the constructions of cell complexes by a finite sequences of closed cell attachments, which attach arbitrarily many cells at a time, agree. Likewise, the constructions of finite CW complexes relative to a compactly generated weak Hausdorff space also agree. On the other hand, we give examples showing that the constructions of finite-dimensional CW complexes, CW complexes of finite type, and finite relative CW complexes need not agree.</description>
