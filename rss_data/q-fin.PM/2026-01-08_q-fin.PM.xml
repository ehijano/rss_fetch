      <title>A comprehensive review and analysis of different modeling approaches for financial index tracking problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Index tracking, also known as passive investing, has gained significant traction in financial markets due to its cost-effective and efficient approach to replicating the performance of a specific market index. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and strategies developed for index tracking, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach. We categorize the index tracking models into three broad frameworks: optimization-based models, statistical-based models and machine learning based data-driven approach. A comprehensive empirical study conducted on the S\&amp;P 500 dataset demonstrates that the tracking error volatility model under the optimization-based framework delivers the most precise index tracking, the convex co-integration model, under the statistical-based framework achieves the strongest return-risk balance, and the deep neural network with fixed noise model within the data-driven framework provides a competitive performance with notably low turnover and high computational efficiency. By combining a critical review of the existing literature with comparative empirical analysis, this paper aims to provide insights into the evolving landscape of index tracking and its practical implications for investors and fund managers.</description>

      <title>Class of topological portfolios: Are they better than classical portfolios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA), an emerging field in investment sciences, harnesses mathematical methods to extract data features based on shape, offering a promising alternative to classical portfolio selection methodologies. We utilize persistence landscapes, a type of summary statistics for persistent homology, to capture the topological variation of returns, blossoming a novel concept of ``Topological Risk". Our proposed topological risk then quantifies portfolio risk by tracking time-varying topological properties of assets through the $L_p$ norm of the persistence landscape. Through optimization, we derive an optimal portfolio that minimizes this topological risk. Numerical experiments conducted using nearly a decade long S\&amp;P 500 data demonstrate the superior performance of our TDA-based portfolios in comparison to the seven popular portfolio optimization models and two benchmark portfolio strategies, the naive $1/N$ portfolio and the S\&amp;P 500 market index, in terms of excess mean return, and several financial ratios. The outcome remains consistent through out the computational analysis conducted for the varying size of holding and investment time horizon. These results underscore the potential of our TDA-based topological risk metric in providing a more comprehensive understanding of portfolio dynamics than traditional statistical measures. As such, it holds significant relevance for modern portfolio management practices.</description>

      <title>Smart Predict--then--Optimize Paradigm for Portfolio Optimization in Real Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04062v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improvements in return forecast accuracy do not always lead to proportional improvements in portfolio decision quality, especially under realistic trading frictions and constraints. This paper adopts the Smart Predict--then--Optimize (SPO) paradigm for portfolio optimization in real markets, which explicitly aligns the learning objective with downstream portfolio decision quality rather than pointwise prediction accuracy. Within this paradigm, predictive models are trained using an SPO-based surrogate loss that directly reflects the performance of the resulting investment decisions. To preserve interpretability and robustness, we employ linear predictors built on return-based and technical-indicator features and integrate them with portfolio optimization models that incorporate transaction costs, turnover control, and regularization. We evaluate the proposed approach on U.S. ETF data (2015--2025) using a rolling-window backtest with monthly rebalancing. Empirical results show that decision-focused training consistently improves risk-adjusted performance over predict--then--optimize baselines and classical optimization benchmarks, and yields strong robustness during adverse market regimes (e.g., the 2020 COVID-19). These findings highlight the practical value of the Smart Predict--then--Optimize paradigm for portfolio optimization in realistic and non-stationary financial environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal dividend payout with path-dependent drawdown constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal dividend problem with a drawdown constraint in a Brownian motion model, requiring the dividend payout rate to remain above a fixed proportion of its historical maximum. This leads to a path-dependent stochastic control problem, as the admissible control depends on its own past values. The associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is a novel two-dimensional variational inequality with a gradient constraint, a type of problem previously only analyzed in the literature using viscosity solution techniques. In contrast, this paper employs delicate PDE methods to establish the existence of a strong solution. This stronger regularity allows us to explicitly characterize an optimal feedback control strategy, expressed in terms of two free boundaries and the running maximum surplus process. Furthermore, we derive key properties of the value function and the free boundaries, including boundedness and continuity. Numerical examples are provided to verify the theoretical results and to offer new financial insights.</description>
