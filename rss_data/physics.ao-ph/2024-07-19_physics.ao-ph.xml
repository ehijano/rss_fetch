      <title>Distributions and correlation properties of offshore wind speeds and wind speed increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine distributions and correlation properties of offshore wind speeds and wind speed increments by analyzing wind data sampled with a resolution of one second for 20 months at different heights over the sea level in the North Sea. Distributions of horizontal wind speeds can be fitted to Weibull distributions with shape and scale parameters varying weakly with the vertical height separation. Kullback-Leibler divergences between distributions at different heights change with the squared logarithm of the height ratio. Cross-correlations between time derivates of wind speeds are long-term anticorrelated and their correlations functions satisfy sum rules. Distributions of horizontal wind speed increments change from a tent-like shape to a Gaussian with rising increment lag. A surprising peak occurs in the left tail of the increment distributions for lags in a range $10-200\,{\rm km}$ after applying the Taylor's hypothesis locally to transform time lags into distances. The peak is decisive in order to obtain an expected and observed linear scaling of third-order structure functions with distance. This suggests that it is an intrinsic feature of atmospheric turbulence.</description>

      <title>The Radiation Balance for a semi-gray Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The equations governing the radiation balance are discussed and exactly solved for the model of the semi-gray atmosphere, i.e. an atmosphere that has regions of transparant frequencies and regions with the same absorption coefficient.</description>

      <title>Stable Machine-Learning Parameterization of Subgrid Processes with Real Geography and Full-physics Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern climate projections often suffer from inadequate spatial and temporal resolution due to computational limitations, resulting in inaccurate representations of sub-resolution processes. A promising technique to address this is the Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which embeds a small-domain, kilometer-resolution cloud-resolving model within each atmospheric column of a host climate model to replace traditional convection and cloud parameterizations. Machine learning (ML) offers a unique opportunity to make MMF more accessible by emulating the embedded cloud-resolving model and thereby reducing its substantial computational cost. Although many studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept success of emulating the MMF model with stable hybrid simulations, it remains a challenge to achieve operational-level success with real geography and comprehensive variable emulation, such as explicit cloud condensate coupling. In this study, we present a stable hybrid model capable of integrating for at least 5 years with near operational-level complexity, including real geography, seasonality, explicit predictions of cloud condensate and wind tendencies, and land coupling. Our model demonstrates skillful online performance such as 5-year zonal mean biases when comparing to previous MMF emulation studies. Key factors contributing to this online performance include using an expressive U-Net architecture, leveraging input features that includes large-scale forcings and convection memory, and incorporating microphysical constraints. With microphysical constraints mitigating unrealistic cloud formation, our work is the first work that demonstrates realistic multi-year cloud condensate climatology under the multi-scale modeling framework. Our work showcases the potential of ML parameterization for operational-level climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Accurate Zernike-Corrected Phase Screens for Arbitrary Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wave propagation through random continuous media remains an important fundamental problem with applications ranging from remote sensing to quantum communication. Typically, such media are characterized by smooth refractive index fluctuations whose impact on the wave can be captured by the stochastic parabolic equation. The latter can be solved numerically by means of a split-step method, which replaces the continuous medium with a number of discrete phase screens derived from the medium's power spectrum. We introduce and benchmark highly accurate and efficient hybrid phase screens for arbitrary power spectra which are based on the combination of Zernike and Fourier phase screens.</description>
