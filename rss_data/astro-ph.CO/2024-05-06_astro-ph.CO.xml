      <title>JWST Lensed quasar dark matter survey II: Strongest gravitational lensing limit on the dark matter free streaming length to date</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers in which we use JWST MIRI multiband imaging to measure the warm dust emission in a sample of 31 multiply imaged quasars, to be used as a probe of the particle nature of dark matter. We present measurements of the relative magnifications of the strongly lensed warm dust emission in a sample of 9 systems. The warm dust region is compact and sensitive to perturbations by populations of halos down to masses $\sim 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$. Using these warm dust flux-ratio measurements in combination with 5 previous narrow-line flux-ratio measurements, we constrain the halo mass function. In our model, we allow for complex deflector macromodels with flexible third and fourth-order multipole deviations from ellipticity, and we introduce an improved model of the tidal evolution of subhalos. We constrain a WDM model and find an upper limit on the half-mode mass of $10^{7.6} M_\odot$ at posterior odds of 10:1. This corresponds to a lower limit on a thermally produced dark matter particle mass of 6.1 keV. This is the strongest gravitational lensing constraint to date, and comparable to those from independent probes such as the Ly$\alpha$ forest and Milky Way satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: Combining cross-spectral foreground cleaning with multi-tracer $B$-mode delensing for improved constraints on inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Simons Observatory (SO), due to start full science operations in early 2025, aims to set tight constraints on inflationary physics by inferring the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from measurements of CMB polarization $B$-modes. Its nominal design targets a precision $\sigma(r=0) \leq 0.003$ without delensing. Achieving this goal and further reducing uncertainties requires the mitigation of other sources of large-scale $B$-modes such as Galactic foregrounds and weak gravitational lensing. We present an analysis pipeline aiming to estimate $r$ by including delensing within a cross-spectral likelihood, and demonstrate it on SO-like simulations. Lensing $B$-modes are synthesised using internal CMB lensing reconstructions as well as Planck-like CIB maps and LSST-like galaxy density maps. This $B$-mode template is then introduced into SO's power-spectrum-based foreground-cleaning algorithm by extending the likelihood function to include all auto- and cross-spectra between the lensing template and the SAT $B$-modes. Within this framework, we demonstrate the equivalence of map-based and cross-spectral delensing and use it to motivate an optimized pixel-weighting scheme for power spectrum estimation. We start by validating our pipeline in the simplistic case of uniform foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the absence of primordial $B$-modes, $\sigma(r)$ decreases by 37% as a result of delensing. Tensor modes at the level of $r=0.01$ are successfully detected by our pipeline. Even with more realistic foreground models including spatial variations in the dust and synchrotron spectral properties, we obtain unbiased estimates of $r$ by employing the moment-expansion method. In this case, delensing-related improvements range between 27% and 31%. These results constitute the first realistic assessment of the delensing performance at SO's nominal sensitivity level.

      <title>Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter 2024. Proceedings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second "Mineral Detection of Neutrinos and Dark Matter" (MDvDM'24) meeting was held January 8-11, 2024 in Arlington, VA, USA, hosted by Virginia Tech's Center for Neutrino Physics. This document collects contributions from this workshop, providing an overview of activities in the field. MDvDM'24 was the second topical workshop dedicated to the emerging field of mineral detection of neutrinos and dark matter, following a meeting hosted by IFPU in Trieste, Italy in October 2022. Mineral detectors have been proposed for a wide variety of applications, including searching for dark matter, measuring various fluxes of astrophysical neutrinos over gigayear timescales, monitoring nuclear reactors, and nuclear disarmament protocols; both as paleo-detectors using natural minerals that could have recorded the traces of nuclear recoils for timescales as long as a billion years and as detectors recording nuclear recoil events on laboratory timescales using natural or artificial minerals. Contributions to this proceedings discuss the vast physics potential, the progress in experimental studies, and the numerous challenges lying ahead on the path towards mineral detection. These include a better understanding of the formation and annealing of recoil defects in crystals; identifying the best classes of minerals and, for paleo-detectors, understanding their geology; modeling and control of the relevant backgrounds; developing, combining, and scaling up imaging and data analysis techniques; and many others. During the last years, MDvDM has grown rapidly and gained attention. Small-scale experimental efforts focused on establishing various microscopic readout techniques are underway at institutions in North America, Europe and Asia. We are looking ahead to an exciting future full of challenges to overcome, surprises to be encountered, and discoveries lying ahead of us.</description>

      <title>Two shadows on two backlights: forecasting the Ly-$\alpha$ forest $\times$ CMB Lensing bispectrum from ACT/SO/S4 &amp; DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast the sensitivity of future correlations between CMB lensing and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest power spectrum. This squeezed-limit bispectrum probes the connection between the Lyman-$\alpha$ transmission and the underlying large-scale matter density field. We recover the measured signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio obtained with Planck$\times$BOSS, and forecast a SNR of $10.3, 14.8$ and $20.2$ for DESI combined with ACT, SO and CMB-S4 respectively. For DESI and SO/CMB-S4, the correlation should be detectable at SNR$\ge 5$ in 5 redshift bins, useful for distinguishing our signal from several contaminants.Indeed, our forecast is affected by large theoretical uncertainties in the current modeling of the signal and its contaminants, such as continuum misestimation bias or damped-Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers. Quantifying these more accurately will be crucial to enable a reliable cosmological interpretation of this observable in future measurements. We attempt to enumerate the features required in future Lyman-$\alpha$ forest simulations required to do so.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Lagrangian bias estimators and the cumulant bias expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of galaxies is a highly complex phenomenon currently impossible to predict deterministically. However, by using a statistical $\textit{bias}$ relation, it becomes possible to robustly model the average abundance of galaxies as a function of the underlying matter density field. Understanding the properties and parametric description of the bias relation is key to extract cosmological information from future galaxy surveys. Here, we contribute to this topic primarily in two ways: (1) We develop a new set of probabilistic estimators for bias parameters using the moments of the Lagrangian galaxy environment distribution. These estimators include spatial corrections at different orders to measure bias parameters independently of the damping scale. We report robust measurements of a variety of bias parameters for haloes, including the tidal bias and its dependence with spin at a fixed mass. (2) We propose an alternative formulation of the bias expansion in terms of "cumulant bias parameters" that describe the response of the logarithmic galaxy density to large-scale perturbations. We find that cumulant biases of haloes are consistent with zero at orders $n &gt; 2$. This suggests that: (i) previously reported bias relations at order $n &gt; 2$ are an artefact of the entangled basis of the canonical bias expansion; (ii) the convergence of the bias expansion may be improved by phrasing it in terms of cumulants; (iii) the bias function is very well approximated by a Gaussian -- an avenue which we explore in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Lagrangian Galaxy Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding $\textit{galaxy bias}$ -- that is the statistical relation between matter and galaxies -- is of key importance for extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys. While the bias function $f$ is usually approximated through a parametric expansion, we show here, that it can also be measured directly from simulations in a non-parameteric way. Our measurements show that the Lagrangian bias function is very close to a Gaussian for halo selections of any mass. Therefore, we newly introduce a Gaussian bias model with several intriguing properties: (1) It predicts only strictly positive probabilities $f &gt; 0$ (unlike expansion models), (2) It has a simple analytic renormalized form and (3) It behaves gracefully in many scenarios where the classical expansion converges poorly. We show that the Gaussian bias model describes the galaxy environment distribution $p(\delta | \mathrm{g})$, the scale dependent bias function $f$ and the renormalized bias function $F$ of haloes and galaxies generally equally well or significantly better than a second order expansion with the same number of parameters. We suggest that a Gaussian bias approach may enhance the range of validity of bias schemes where the canonical expansion converges poorly and further, that it may make new applications possible, since it guarantees the positivity of predicted galaxy densities.</description>

      <title>The role of LRG1 and LRG2's monopole in inferring the DESI 2024 BAO cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration recently release the first year data (DR1) of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy, quasar and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest tracers. When combined the CMB and SNIa data with DESI BAO, its cosmological implication shows a hint of thawing dark energy behavior. The official distance measurements for cosmology analysis are given in terms of the comoving distances along ($D_H$), and perpendicular to ($D_M$), the line of sight to the observer. We notice that there are $1\sim2\sigma$ deviations in $D_M$ and $D_H$ from the values of Planck cosmology in the luminous red galaxies (LRG) bin 1 and bin 2, namely LRG1 and LRG2. In this paper, we want to study the role of LRG1 and LRG2 in driving the DESI 2024 BAO osmology away from Planck cosmology. Since the angle-averaged distance $D_V$ and the ratio of transverse and line-of-sight comoving distances $F_{\rm AP}=D_M/D_H$ are more directly related with the measured monopole and quadrupole components of galaxy power spectrum or correlation function, we use $D_V$ and $F_{\rm AP}$ instead of the officially adopted $D_M$ and $D_H$. The purpose of this data vector transformation is to isolate the influence of monopoles in LRG1 and LRG2 in driving the deviation from $w=-1$. We find that by removing the $D_V$ data point in LRG2, the DESI + CMB + SNIa data compilation recovers $w=-1$ within $2\sigma$ contour.Similarly, the exclusion of the $D_V$ data point from LRG1 shifts the contour in the $w_0/w_a$ plane toward $w=-1$, though no intersection is observed. This underscores the preference of both the LRG1 and LRG2 BAO monopole components for the thawing dark energy model, with LRG2 exhibiting a stronger preference compared to LRG1. Alongside this paper, we provide the $D_V$ and $F_{\rm AP}$ data as well as their covariance.</description>

      <title>The effective field theory of multi-field inflationary fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build an effective field theory of multi-field inflationary fluctuations based on the adiabatic perturbation and on any number of matter fluctuations in the non-adiabatic sector, without imposing extra symmetries on the latter. Focusing on terms with at most two derivatives in fields' fluctuations, we argue that taking the decoupling limit -- in which gravitational interactions are neglected -- is justified in a quasi de Sitter spacetime with slow-varying Hubble scale. With these working hypotheses, we find simple forms of multi-field mixings (quadratic order) and interactions (cubic order). We explain how to break degeneracies amongst various terms, and we compare the predictions of the effective field theory to those of non-linear sigma models of inflation and more general multi-field Lagrangian in the traditional model approach. We stress that several multi-field cubic interactions are dictated by non-linearly realised spacetime symmetries and are therefore given in terms of parameters already present in the quadratic action. We propose various directions to systematically explore the phenomenology generic to multi-field inflation and beyond the lamppost of known models.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Masked Mock Data Challenge for Beyond-Two-Point Galaxy Clustering Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last few years have seen the emergence of a wide array of novel techniques for analyzing high-precision data from upcoming galaxy surveys, which aim to extend the statistical analysis of galaxy clustering data beyond the linear regime and the canonical two-point (2pt) statistics. We test and benchmark some of these new techniques in a community data challenge "Beyond-2pt", initiated during the Aspen 2022 Summer Program "Large-Scale Structure Cosmology beyond 2-Point Statistics," whose first round of results we present here. The challenge dataset consists of high-precision mock galaxy catalogs for clustering in real space, redshift space, and on a light cone. Participants in the challenge have developed end-to-end pipelines to analyze mock catalogs and extract unknown ("masked") cosmological parameters of the underlying $\Lambda$CDM models with their methods. The methods represented are density-split clustering, nearest neighbor statistics, BACCO power spectrum emulator, void statistics, LEFTfield field-level inference using effective field theory (EFT), and joint power spectrum and bispectrum analyses using both EFT and simulation-based inference. In this work, we review the results of the challenge, focusing on problems solved, lessons learned, and future research needed to perfect the emerging beyond-2pt approaches. The unbiased parameter recovery demonstrated in this challenge by multiple statistics and the associated modeling and inference frameworks supports the credibility of cosmology constraints from these methods. The challenge data set is publicly available and we welcome future submissions from methods that are not yet represented.</description>

      <title>Boosting gravitational waves: a review of kinematic effects on amplitude, polarization, frequency and energy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the kinematic effects on a gravitational wave due to either a peculiar motion of the astrophysical source emitting it or a local motion of the observer. We show, at fully non-linear order in velocity, that the amplitude of the wave is amplified by the Doppler factor in the case in which the source moves with respect to a reference frame, while it is invariant if the observer moves (with respect to a reference observer). However, the observed specific intensity transforms in the same way under a boost of the source or of the observer. We also show at fully non-linear order that under a boost (of either source or observer), the polarization tensor is rotated in the same way the wave direction is rotated by aberration, such that the only net effect of a boost on polarization is to change the phase of the helicity components. We apply these results to a wave emitted by a binary system of compact objects in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the overabundance of luminous $z&gt;10$ objects observed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times ($z&gt;10$) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z&gt;6$. Because many of the high-$z$ objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-$z$ sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters -- which characterize the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation -- to a compilation of $z&gt;10$ JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10\% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive ($M_\bullet/M_\star\sim10^{-2}$) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at $z=4-8$. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on conformal ultralight dark matter couplings from the European Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely precise celestial clocks: as they rotate, the beamed radio waves emitted along the axis of their magnetic field can be detected with radio telescopes, which allows for tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods. A possible effect on the period of a pulsar is given by a potential coupling to dark matter, in cases where it is modeled with an "ultralight" scalar field. In this paper, we consider a universal conformal coupling of the dark matter scalar to gravity, which in turn mediates an effective coupling between pulsars and dark matter. If the dark matter scalar field is changing in time, as expected in the Milky Way, this effective coupling produces a periodic modulation of the pulsar rotational frequency. By studying the time series of observed radio pulses collected by the European Pulsar Timing Array experiment, we present constraints on the coupling of dark matter, improving on existing bounds. These bounds can also be regarded as constraints on the parameters of scalar-tensor theories of the Fierz-Jordan-Brans-Dicke and Damour-Esposito-Far\`{e}se types in the presence of a (light) mass potential term.</description>

      <title>A quantification of the effects using different stellar population synthesis models for epoch of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The luminosity and spectral energy distribution (SED) of high-$z$ galaxies are sensitive to the stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. In this paper, we study the effects of different SPS models on the measurements of high-$z$ galaxies and the budget of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization, by employing each of them in the semi-analytical galaxy formation model {\sc L-Galaxies 2020}. We find that the different SPS models lead to $\lesssim 0.5$ dex differences on the amplitudes of UV luminosity functions, while the two modes of the same SPS model with and without the inclusion of binary stars leads to similar UV luminosity functions at $z \ge 6$. Instead, the binary stars produce $\sim 40\%$ more ionizing photons than the single stars, while such differences are smaller than those caused by different SPS models, e.g. the BPASS model produces $\sim 100\%$ more ionizing photons than other models.</description>

      <title>Bubble wall velocity and gravitational wave in the minimal left-right symmetric model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bubble wall velocity in the first order phase transition plays an important role in determining both the amplitude and the pivot frequency of stochastic gravitational wave background. In the framework of the minimal left-right symmetric model, we study the wall velocity when the first order phase transition can occur. The wall velocity can be determined by matching the distribution functions in the free particle approximation and the local thermal equilibrium approximation. It is found that the wall velocity can be determined in the range $ 0.2 &lt; v_w &lt; 0.5 $ for the parameter space with the first order phase transition. It is also found that for the case when the wall velocity is close to the speed of sound, the peak amplitude of gravitational wave spectrum can be larger than that in the runaway case. Moreover, It is also found that there exists an approximate power law between the wall velocity and pressure difference between broken and symmetry phases, and the power index is equal to 0.41 or so.</description>

      <title>X-ray observations of the Zwicky 3146 galaxy cluster reveal a 3.5 keV excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we present spectral fits of the well-documented sloshing cool-core cluster Zwicky 3146 ($z=0.291$), to test the existence of the highly speculated 3.5 keV line. We report excesses at $&gt;3\sigma$ significance at $E=3.575$ keV, yielding a flux $F = 8.73_{-2.22}^{+2.17}$ $\times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, in \textit{XMM-Newton}, and $E=3.55$ keV, with a flux $F = 10.0_{-2.96}^{+3.05}$ $\times 10^{-6}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in \textit{Chandra}. We explore the possibility that the 3.5 keV excess is correlated to the presence of cold gas within the cluster, based on optical and sub-mm literature analyses. Following the launch of the X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM), high resolution spectroscopy ($\leq 7$ eV) will reveal in unprecedented detail, the origin of this unidentified feature, for which Zwicky 3146 should be considered a viable target, due to the strength of the feature in two independent X-ray telescopes, opening a new window into plasma or charge exchange studies in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Fully Relativistic Derivation of the Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first fully and inherently relativistic derivation of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. This work uses the formalism historically used to compute radiation spectra emerging from inverse Thomson/Compton sources of x-ray radiation. Comparing our results to the traditional approach based on relativistically-corrected classical Kompaneets equation, we find small, but systematic differences. Most notable are the modest (&lt; 10 %) differences in the crossover frequency where the spectral distortion due to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect vanishes, and the energy increase of the distribution at high electron cloud temperatures.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitons and non-stationary processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

      <title>Impact of Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter on Gas Properties at Very High Redshift: A Semi-Analytical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been proposed as potential candidates for dark matter (DM) and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Aims. Our objective is to delve into the distinct impact of PBHs on gas properties and their potential role in shaping the cosmic structure. Specifically, we aim to analyze the evolving gas properties while considering the presence of accreting PBHs with varying monochromatic masses and in different quantities. By studying the feedback effects produced by this accretion, our final goal is to assess the plausibility of PBHs as candidates for DM. Methods. We develop a semi-analytical model which works on top of the CIELO hydrodynamical simulation around $z\sim23$. This model enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of gas properties influenced by PBHs. Our focus lies on the temperature and hydrogen abundances, placing specific emphasis on the region closest to the halo center. We explore PBH masses of $1$, $33$, and $100~\Msun$, located within mass windows where a substantial fraction of DM could exist in the form of PBHs. We investigate various DM fractions composed of these PBHs ($f_{\rm{PBH}}&gt;10^{-4}$). Results. Our findings suggest that the existence of PBHs with masses of $1~\Msun$ and fractions greater than or equal to approximately $10^{-2}$ would be ruled out due to the significant changes induced in gas properties. The same applies to PBHs with a mass of $33~\Msun$ and $100~\Msun$ and fractions greater than approximately $10^{-3}$. These effects are particularly pronounced in the region nearest to the halo center, potentially leading to delayed galaxy formation within haloes.</description>

      <title>Unitarity in the non-relativistic regime and implications for dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity sets upper limits on partial-wave elastic and inelastic cross-sections, which are often violated by perturbative computations. We discuss the dynamics underlying these limits in the non-relativistic regime, namely long-range interactions, and show how the resummation of the elastic 2-particle-irreducible diagrams arising from squaring inelastic processes unitarizes inelastic cross-sections. Our results are model-independent, apply to all partial waves, and affect elastic and inelastic cross-sections, with extensive implications for new physics scenarios, including dark-matter freeze-out and self-interactions.</description>

      <title>An Optical Gamma-Ray Burst Catalogue with Measured Redshift PART I: Data Release of 535 Gamma-Ray Bursts and Colour Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the largest optical photometry compilation of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) with redshifts ($z$). We include 64813 observations of 535 events (including upper limits) from 28 February 1997 up to 18 August 2023. We also present a user-friendly web tool \textit{grbLC} which allows users the visualization of photometry, coordinates, redshift, host galaxy extinction, and spectral indices for each event in our database. Furthermore, we have added a Gamma Ray Coordinate Network (GCN) scraper that can be used to collect data by gathering magnitudes from the GCNs. The web tool also includes a package for uniformly investigating colour evolution. We compute the optical spectral indices for 138 GRBs for which we have at least 4 filters at the same epoch in our sample and craft a procedure to distinguish between GRBs with and without colour evolution. By providing a uniform format and repository for the optical catalogue, this web-based archive is the first step towards unifying several community efforts to gather the photometric information for all GRBs with known redshifts. This catalogue will enable population studies by providing light curves (LCs) with better coverage since we have gathered data from different ground-based locations. Consequently, these LCs can be used to train future LC reconstructions for an extended inference of the redshift. The data gathering also allows us to fill some of the orbital gaps from Swift in crucial points of the LCs, e.g., at the end of the plateau emission or where a jet break is identified.</description>

      <title>Reviving Horndeski after GW170817 by Kaluza-Klein compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Horndeski theory/ Galileons for late time cosmology is heavily constrained by the strict coincidence in the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves. These constraints presuppose that the minimally coupled photon is not modified, not even at the scales where General Relativity (GR) may need modification. We find that the 4D Galileon obtained from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of its higher dimensional version is a natural unified modification of GR and electromagnetism with automatically "luminal" gravitational waves. This property follows without any fine tuning of Galileon potentials for a larger class of theories than previously thought. In particular, the $G_4$ potential is not constrained by the speed test and $G_5$ may also be present. In other words, some Galileon models that have been ruled out since the event GW170817 are, in fact, not necessarily constrained if they arise in 4D from compactifications of their higher dimensional Galileon counterparts. Besides their compelling luminality, the resulting vector Galileons are naturally $U(1)$ gauge invariant.</description>

      <title>Accurate standard siren cosmology with joint gravitational-wave and $\gamma$-ray burst observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint gravitational-wave and $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRB) observations are among the best prospects for standard siren cosmology. However, the strong selection effect for the coincident GRB detection, which is possible only for sources with small inclination angles, induces a systematic uncertainty that is currently not accounted for. We show that this severe source of bias can be removed by inferring the a-priori unknown electromagnetic detection probability directly from multimessenger data. This leads at the same time to an unbiased measurement of the Hubble constant, to constrain the properties of GRB emission, and to accurately measure the viewing angle of each source. Our inference scheme is applicable to real data already in the small-statistics regime, a scenario that might become reality in the near future. Additionally, we introduce a novel likelihood approximant for GW events which treats the dependence on distance and inclination as exact.</description>

      <title>Smooth vs instant inflationary transitions: steepest growth re-examined and primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.07573v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can be produced by a range of mechanisms in the early universe. A particular formation channel that connects PBHs with inflationary phenomenology invokes enhanced primordial curvature perturbations at small scales. In this paper, we examine how rapidly the background can transition between different values of the parameters of the Hubble hierarchy in the context of single-clock inflation, which must ultimately derive from a consistent derivative expansion for the background inflaton field. We discuss artefacts associated with instant or very rapid transitions, and consider the impact on the steepest power spectrum growth and the formation of PBHs. In particular, we highlight the robustness of the $k^4$ steepest growth previously found for single-field inflation with conservatively smoothed transitions and limits on how much the amplitude of the power spectrum can grow, and demonstrate that the PBH mass distribution is sensitive to the artefacts, which go away when the transitions are smoothed. We also show that the mass distribution is relatively insensitive to the steepness of the growth and subsequent decay of the power spectrum, depending primarily on the peak amplitude and the presence of any plateaus that last more than an e-fold. The shape of the power spectrum can of course be constrained by other tracers, and so understanding the physical limitations on its shape remains a pertinent question.</description>

      <title>Governing accelerating Universe via newly reconstructed Hubble parameter by employing empirical data simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new parametrization of the Hubble parameter is proposed to explore the issue of the cosmological landscape. The constraints on model parameters are derived through the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method by employing a comprehensive union of datasets such as 34 data points from cosmic chronometers (CC), 42 points from baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), a recently updated set of 1701 Pantheon$^+$ (P22) data points derived from Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), and 162 data points from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Furthermore, the models are compared by using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), so that a comparative assessment of model performance can be available. Additionally, we compare the Dainotti relation via Gaussian likelihood analysis versus new likelihoods and Calibration of the Dainotti relation through a model-independent method. The kinematic behavior of the models is also investigated by encompassing the transition from deceleration to acceleration and the evolution of the jerk parameter. From the analysis of the parametric models, it is strongly indicated that the Universe is currently undergoing an accelerated phase with diagnostics of the model validating the quintessence phase.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic non-Gaussianity with generic vacua and detection prospects in CMB spectral distortions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming a slow-roll inflationary model where conformal invariance of the Maxwell action is broken via a non-minimal kinetic coupling term, we investigate the non-Gaussian three-point cross-correlation function between the primordial curvature perturbation and the primordial magnetic field, under a fairly general choice of initial vacua for both the scalar and the gauge field sectors. Among the possible triangular configurations of the resulting cross-bispectrum, we find that the squeezed limit leads to local-type non-Gaussianity allowing a product form decomposition in terms of the scalar and magnetic power spectra, which is a generic result independent of any specific choice of the initial states. We subsequently explore its detection prospects in the CMB via correlations between pre-recombination $\mu$-type spectral distortions and temperature anisotropies, sourced by such a primordial cross-correlation. Our analysis with several proposed next-generation CMB missions forecasts a low value of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the $\mu T$ spectrum if both the vacua are assumed to be pure Bunch-Davies. On the contrary, the SNR may be enhanced significantly for non-Bunch-Davies initial states for the magnetic sector within allowed bounds from current CMB data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The immense diversity of the galaxy population in the universe is believed to stem from their disparate merging and star formation histories, and multi-scale influences of diverse environments. No single causal factor of the initial state is known to explain how the galaxies formed and evolved to end up possessing such various traits as they have at the present epoch. However, several observational studies have revealed that the key physical properties of the observed galaxies in the local universe appeared to have a much simpler, lower-dimensional correlation structure than expected, the origin of which remains unexplained. Speculating that the emergence of such a simple correlation structure of the galaxy properties must be triggered by nature rather than by nurture, we explore if the present galaxy properties may be correlated with the initial precondition for protogalaxy angular momentum, $\tau$, and test it against the data from the IllustrisTNG300-1 hydrodynamic simulation. Employing Shannon's information theory, we discover that $\tau$ shares a significantly large amount of mutual information with each of the four basic traits of the TNG galaxies at $z=0$: the spin parameters, formation epochs, stellar-to-total mass ratios, and fraction of kinetic energy in ordered rotation. These basic traits except for the stellar-to-total mass ratios are found to contain even a larger amount of MI about $\tau$ than about the total masses and environments for the case of giant galaxies with $11.5\le \log[M_{\rm t}/(h^{-1}\,M_{\odot})]&lt;13$. Our results imply that the initial condition of the universe must be more impactful on the galaxy evolution than conventionally thought.</description>

      <title>Impact of half-wave plate systematics on the measurement of CMB $B$-mode polarization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can help probe the fundamental physics behind cosmic inflation via the measurement of primordial $B$ modes. As this requires exquisite control over instrumental systematics, some next-generation CMB experiments plan to use a rotating half-wave plate (HWP) as polarization modulator. However, the HWP non-idealities, if not properly treated in the analysis, can result in additional systematics. In this paper, we present a simple, semi-analytical end-to-end model to propagate the HWP non-idealities through the macro-steps that make up any CMB experiment (observation of multi-frequency maps, foreground cleaning, and power spectra estimation) and compute the HWP-induced bias on the estimated tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. We find that the effective polarization efficiency of the HWP suppresses the polarization signal, leading to an underestimation of $r$. Laboratory measurements of the properties of the HWP can be used to calibrate this effect, but we show how gain calibration of the CMB temperature can also be used to partially mitigate it. On the basis of our findings, we present a set of recommendations for the HWP design that can help maximize the benefits of gain calibration.</description>

      <title>High-redshift, small-scale tests of ultralight axion dark matter using Hubble and Webb galaxy UV luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11071v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the abundance of UV-bright galaxies in the presence of ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter (DM), finding that axions suppress their formation with a non-trivial dependence on redshift and luminosity. We set limits on axion DM using both Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and UV luminosity function (UVLF) data. We exclude a single axion as all the DM for $m_{ax} &lt; 10^{-21.6}$ eV and limit axions with $-26 &lt; \log( m_{ax}/{eV}) &lt; -23$ to be less than $22\%$ of the DM (both limits at $95\%$ credibility). These limits use UVLF measurements from 24,000 sources from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that probe small-scale structure at redshifts $4 &lt; z &lt; 10$. We marginalize over a parametric model that connects halo mass and UV luminosity that has been shown to match hydrodynamical simulations. Our results bridge a window in axion mass and DM fraction previously unconstrained by cosmological data, between large-scale CMB and galaxy clustering and the small-scale Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These high-$z$ measurements provide a powerful consistency check of low-$z$ tests of axion DM, which include the recent hint for a sub-dominant ULA DM fraction in Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data. We also consider a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed high-$z$ galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We find that these data are consistent with the HST UVLF assuming $\Lambda$CDM and our flexible parametric model of UV luminosity. Combining HST and JWST UVLF data does not improve our constraints beyond HST alone, but future JWST measurements have the potential to improve these results significantly. We also find an excess of low-mass halos ($&lt; 10^9 M_\odot$) at $z &lt; 3$, which could be probed by sub-galactic structure probes (e.g., stellar streams, satellite galaxies and strong lensing).</description>

      <title>ALP Dark Matter Mini-Clusters from Kinetic Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that very compact axion mini-clusters can form in models where axion-like-particle (ALP) dark matter is produced via the kinetic misalignment mechanism, which is well-motivated in pre-inflationary $U(1)$ symmetry breaking scenarios. This is due to ALP fragmentation. We predict denser halos than what has been obtained so far in the literature from standard misalignment in post-inflationary $U(1)$ breaking scenarios or from large misalignment. The main reason is that adiabatic fluctuations are significant at early times; therefore, even if amplification from parametric resonance effects is moderate, the final size of ALP fluctuations is larger in kinetic misalignment. We compare halo mass functions and halo spectra obtained in kinetic misalignment, large misalignment, and standard misalignment, respectively. Our analysis does not depend on the specific model realization of the kinetic misalignment mechanism. We present our results generally as a function of the ALP mass and the ALP decay constant only. We show that a sizable region of this ALP parameter space can be tested by future experiments that probe small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 Sensitivities to Reheating in Plateau Models of Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sensitivity of LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 to the reheating temperature and the inflaton coupling in three types of plateau-potential models of inflation, namely mutated hilltop inflation, radion gauge inflation, and $\alpha$-attractor T models. We first find relations between model parameters and CMB observables in all models. We then perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain based forecasts to quantify the information gain on the reheating temperature, the inflaton coupling, and the scale of inflation that can be achieved with LiteBIRD and CMB-S4, assuming a fiducial tensor-to-scalar ratio $\bar{r} \sim 0.02$ and neglecting foreground contamination of the B-mode polarization spectrum. We compare the results of the forecasts to those obtained from a recently proposed simple analytic method. We find that both LiteBIRD and CMB-S4 can simultaneously constrain the scale of inflation and the reheating temperature in all three types of models. They can for the first time obtain both an upper and lower bound on the latter, comprising the first ever measurement of the big bang temperature. In the mutated hilltop inflation and radion gauge inflation models this can be translated into a measurement of the inflaton coupling in parts of the parameter space. Constraining this microphysical parameter will help to understand how these models of inflation may be embedded into a more fundamental theory of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Practical approaches to analyzing PTA data: Cosmic strings with six pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a network of cosmic strings using six millisecond pulsars from Data Release 2 (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA). We perform a Bayesian analysis considering two models for the network of cosmic string loops, and compare it to a simple power-law model which is expected from the population of supermassive black hole binaries. Our main strong assumption is that the previously reported common red noise process is a SGWB. We find that the one-parameter cosmic string model is slightly favored over a power-law model thanks to its simplicity. If we assume a two-component stochastic signal in the data (supermassive black hole binary population and the signal from cosmic strings), we get a $95\%$ upper limit on the string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu) &lt; -9.9$ ($-10.5$) for the two cosmic string models we consider. In extended two-parameter string models, we were unable to constrain the number of kinks. We test two approximate and fast Bayesian data analysis methods against the most rigorous analysis and find consistent results. These two fast and efficient methods are applicable to all SGWBs, independent of their source, and will be crucial for analysis of extended data sets.</description>

      <title>A massive galaxy that formed its stars at $z \sim 11$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of galaxies by gradual hierarchical co-assembly of baryons and cold dark matter halos is a fundamental paradigm underpinning modern astrophysics and predicts a strong decline in the number of massive galaxies at early cosmic times. Extremely massive quiescent galaxies (stellar masses $&gt;10^{11}$ M$_\odot$) have now been observed as early as 1-2 billions years after the Big Bang; these are extremely constraining on theoretical models as they form 300-500 Myr earlier and only some models can form massive galaxies this early. Here we report on the spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope of a massive quiescent galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at redshift 3.205 $\pm$ 0.005 that eluded deep ground-based spectrscopy, is significantly redder than typical and whose spectrum reveals features typical of much older stellar populations. Detailed modelling shows the stellar population formed around 1.5 billion years earlier in time (z ~ 11) at an epoch when dark matter halos of sufficient hosting mass have not yet assembled in the standard scenario. This observation may point to the presence of undetected populations of early galaxies and the possibility of significant gaps in our understanding of early stellar populations, galaxy formation and/or the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dissecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background with Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometry, the precise measurement of star motions, offers an alternative avenue to investigate low-frequency gravitational waves through the spatial deflection of photons, complementing pulsar timing arrays reliant on timing residuals. Upcoming data from Gaia and Roman can not only cross-check pulsar timing array findings but also explore the uncharted frequency range bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA. We present an analytical framework to evaluate the feasibility of detecting a gravitational wave background, considering measurement noise and the intrinsic variability of the stochastic background. Furthermore, we highlight astrometry's crucial role in uncovering key properties of the gravitational wave background, such as spectral index and chirality, employing information-matrix analysis. Finally, we simulate the emergence of quadrupolar correlations, commonly referred to as the generalized Hellings-Downs curves.</description>

      <title>A nonperturbative test of nucleation calculations for strong phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nucleation rate computations are of broad importance in particle physics and cosmology. Perturbative calculations are often used to compute the nucleation rate $\Gamma$, but these are incomplete. We perform nonperturbative lattice simulations of nucleation in a scalar field theory with a tree-level barrier, computing a final result extrapolated to the thermodynamic and continuum limits. Although the system in question should be well-described by a complete one-loop perturbative calculation, we find only qualitative agreement with the full perturbative result, with a 20% discrepancy in $|\log \Gamma|$. Our result motivates further testing of the current nucleation paradigm.</description>

      <title>Identifying Halos in Cosmological Simulations with Continuous Wavelet Analysis: The 2D Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous wavelet analysis is gaining popularity in science and engineering for its ability to analyze data across spatial and scale domain simultaneously. In this study, we introduce a wavelet-based method to identify halos and assess its feasibility in two-dimensional (2D) scenarios. We begin with the generation of four pseudo-2D datasets from the SIMBA dark matter simulation by compressing thin slices of three-dimensional (3D) data into 2D. We then calculate the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) directly from the particle distributions, identify local maxima that represent actual halos, and segment the CWT to delineate halo boundaries. A comparison with the traditional Friends-of-Friends (FOF) method shows that our CWT-identified halos, while containing slightly fewer particles, have smoother boundaries and are more compact in dense regions. In contrast, the CWT method can link particles over greater distances to form halos in sparse regions due to its spatial segmentation scheme. The spatial distribution and halo power spectrum of both CWT and FOF halos demonstrate substantial consistency, validating the 2D applicability of CWT for halo detection. Our identification scheme operates with a linear time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$, suggesting its suitability for analyzing significantly larger datasets in the future.</description>
