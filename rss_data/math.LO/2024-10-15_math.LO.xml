      <title>$\omega$-consistency for Different Arrays of Quantifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formalized v statement by allowing the occurrence of different arrays of quantifiers in it. We prove that for some specific arrays of quantifiers we get consistency statements that are S-equivalent to the original $\omega$-consistency statement (S denotes the basis theory to develop metamathematics). We end our paper by creating a theory of truth that proves each $\omega$-consistency-statement.</description>

      <title>Non-forking independence in stable theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that a simple condition suffices to describes non-forking independence over models in a stable theory.
  Under mild assumptions, this description can be extended to non-forking independence over algebraically closed subsets, without having to use the full strength of the work of the seminal work of Kim and Pillay. The results in this note (which are surely well-known among most model theorists) essentially use that types over models in a stable theory are stationary.</description>

      <title>Definable henselian valuations on dp-minimal real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit algebraic characterisation of all definable henselian valuations on a dp-minimal real field. Additionally we characterise all dp-minimal real fields that admit a definable henselian valuation with real closed residue field. We do so by first proving this for the more general setting of almost real closed fields.</description>

      <title>Measurability in the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning states that a hypothesis space is PAC learnable if and only if its VC dimension is finite. For the agnostic model of PAC learning, the literature so far presents proofs of this theorem that often tacitly impose several measurability assumptions on the involved sets and functions. We scrutinize these proofs from a measure-theoretic perspective in order to extract the assumptions needed for a rigorous argument. This leads to a sound statement as well as a detailed and self-contained proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning in the agnostic setting, showcasing the minimal measurability requirements needed. We then discuss applications in Model Theory, considering NIP and o-minimal structures. Our main theorem presents sufficient conditions for the PAC learnability of hypothesis spaces defined over o-minimal expansions of the reals.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analysis of classical algorithms resulted in their axiomatization as transition systems satisfying some simple postulates, and in the formulation of the Abstract State Machine Theorem, which assures us that any classical algorithm can be emulated step-by-step by a most general model of computation, called an ``abstract state machine''. We refine that analysis to take details of intra-step behavior into account, and show that there is in fact an abstract state machine that not only has the same state transitions as does a given algorithm but also performs the exact same tests on states when determining how to proceed to the next state. This enhancement allows the inclusion -- within the abstract-state-machine framework -- of algorithms whose states only have partially-defined equality, or employ other native partial functions, as is the case, for instance, with inversion of a matrix of computable reals.</description>

      <title>Reasoning Around Paradox with Grounded Deduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we reason around logical paradoxes without falling into them? This paper introduces grounded deduction or GD, a Kripke-inspired approach to first-order logic and arithmetic that is neither classical nor intuitionistic, but nevertheless appears both pragmatically usable and intuitively justifiable. GD permits the direct expression of unrestricted recursive definitions - including paradoxical ones such as 'L := not L' - while adding dynamic typing premises to certain inference rules so that such paradoxes do not lead to inconsistency. This paper constitutes a preliminary development and investigation of grounded deduction, to be extended with further elaboration and deeper analysis of its intriguing properties.</description>
