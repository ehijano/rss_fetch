      <title>Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the degree of polarization of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample --based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.</description>

      <title>A Novel 6-axis Force/Torque Sensor Using Inductance Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel six-axis force/torque (F/T) sensor based on inductive sensing technology. Unlike conventional strain gauge-based sensors that require direct contact and external amplification, the proposed sensor utilizes non-contact inductive measurements to estimate force via displacement of a conductive target. A compact, fully integrated architecture is achieved by incorporating a CAN-FD based signal processing module directly onto the PCB, enabling high-speed data acquisition at up to 4~kHz without external DAQ systems. The sensing mechanism is modeled and calibrated through a rational function fitting approach, which demonstrated superior performance in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination ($R^2$), and linearity error compared to other nonlinear models. Static and repeatability experiments validate the sensor's accuracy, achieving a resolution of 0.03~N and quantization levels exceeding 55,000 steps, surpassing that of commercial sensors. The sensor also exhibits low crosstalk, high sensitivity, and robust noise characteristics. Its performance and structure make it suitable for precision robotic applications, especially in scenarios where compactness, non-contact operation, and integrated processing are essential.</description>
