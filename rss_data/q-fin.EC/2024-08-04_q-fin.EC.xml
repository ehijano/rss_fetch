      <title>A Perfect Storm: First-Nature Geography and Economic Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is geography destiny? What is the role of first-nature geography in determining prosperity? This paper estimates the effect of randomly removing and introducing favorable first-nature geography to a specific region using a difference in difference design. In 1825 a storm created a new natural navigable waterway, bringing trade and prosperity to the otherwise relatively isolated northwestern Denmark. 700 years prior, the same event happened in reverse, when a previous channel closed up between 1086 and 1208. The elasticity of geography-induced market access is estimated to be 1.6, corresponding to 26.7 percent population growth within a generation of the event. Demonstrated mechanisms include trade, fertility, fishing, and the rise of manufacturing. The central finding is replicated in reverse in a register of dated archaeological sites. The 1086-1208 closing caused fewer buildings and sites containing coins. The general insight is the same: First-nature geography determines the levels and location of prosperity.</description>

      <title>Towards fair roads -- Why we should &amp; how to improve the fairness in traffic engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic engineering aims to control infrastructure and population behavior to achieve optimal usage of road networks. Fairness is fundamental to stimulate cooperation in large populations, and plays an important role in traffic engineering, as it increases the well-being of users, improves driving safety by rule-adherence, and overcomes public resistance at legislative implementation. Despite the importance of fairness, only a few works have translated fairness into the transportation domain, with a focus on transportation planning rather than traffic engineering. This work highlights the importance of fairness when solving conflicts of large populations for scare, public good, road-network resources with traffic engineering, and establishes a connection to the modern fairness theories. Moreover, this work presents a fairness framework that serves when designing traffic engineering solutions, when convincing in public debates with a useful, argumentative tool-set to confront equity considerations, and enables systematic research and design of control systems.</description>

      <title>How Ethical Should AI Be? How AI Alignment Shapes the Risk Preferences of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the risk preferences of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how aligning them with human ethical standards affects their economic decision-making. Analyzing 30 LLMs reveals a range of inherent risk profiles, from risk-averse to risk-seeking. We find that aligning LLMs with human values, focusing on harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty, shifts them towards risk aversion. While some alignment improves investment forecast accuracy, excessive alignment leads to overly cautious predictions, potentially resulting in severe underinvestment. Our findings highlight the need for a nuanced approach that balances ethical alignment with the specific requirements of economic domains when using LLMs in finance.</description>
