      <title>Egocentric Mixed-Methods SNA: Analyzing Interviews with Women and/or Queer and LGBT+ Ph.D. Physicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network analysis (SNA) has been widely used in physics education research (PER) in recent years, but mostly in a limited range of the available modalities. This paper describes a unique approach to egocentric, mixed-methods SNA applied to qualitative network data obtained from 100 interviews with women and/or queer professional physicists. We focus on our methods for obtaining quantitative network data from these qualitative sources and present novel techniques for analysis of the networks. We also examine the ways in which egocentric and mixed-methods SNA techniques are aligned with critical methods and well-suited to the study of difference, non-normativity, and experiences of marginalization in physics spaces and communities. We explore the limitations and potential applications of these methods and situate this work in the larger context of our study of these interviews. This work bridges a methodological gap between SNA and qualitative work on identity in PER and begins to develop our understanding of the way gender and sexual minority physicists experience support.</description>

      <title>Smartphone-Based Undergraduate Physics Labs: A Comprehensive Review of Innovation, Accessibility, and Pedagogical Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphone-integrated physics laboratories (SmartIPLs) have emerged as scalable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional lab instruction, providing accessible, hands-on experiences for diverse learning environments. This review synthesizes over a decade of research, covering nearly 200 SmartIPLs across key physics domains such as mechanics, optics, acoustics, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and modern physics. SmartIPLs are categorized into two primary types: sensor-based experiments using built-in smartphone tools and camera-based video/image analysis for motion and optical studies. Empirical studies show that SmartIPLs support equal or greater gains in conceptual understanding, science process skills, and student engagement, especially in remote and under-resourced settings. The review explores their theoretical foundations, compares them to traditional and virtual labs, and addresses challenges such as device variability and classroom integration. Future directions include broader curricular integration, AI-driven student feedback, expansion into underrepresented physics topics, interdisciplinary applications, and equity-focused instructional design. Open-access resources, such as the UGA SmartPhone Intro Physics Lab and Modern Optics YouTube channels and the SPIE book Use of Smartphones in Optical Experimentation, highlight community-driven efforts to expand and democratize physics education. As smartphone technology advances, SmartIPLs will offer a promising path toward adaptive, intelligent, and inclusive laboratory instruction for the 21st century.</description>

      <title>Closeness in a physics faculty online learning community predicts impacts in self-efficacy and teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community-based professional development initiatives have been shown to support physics faculty in their adoption of research-based instructional strategies. Hoping to better understand these initiatives' mechanisms of success, we analyze the results of two surveys administered to a faculty online learning community teaching a common physics curriculum designed primarily for pre-service elementary teachers. We use social network analysis to represent the faculty network and compare members' centrality, a family of measures that capture the prominence of individuals within a network, to their reported experience in the community. We use a principal component analysis of different centrality measures to show that closeness, a measure of how closely connected a person is with every other person in their network, is the most appropriate centrality measure for our network. We then compare regression models according to Bayes factors to find relationships between participants' closeness and their survey responses. We find that participants' self-efficacy, as well as their sense of improvement to their teaching and sense of benefitting from the community, are predictors of their closeness with other participants and thus their breadth and depth of participation in the community. Our results are consistent with other studies that have highlighted interactions among faculty as key components of successful professional development initiatives. They may also be useful for designers of similar communities as they decide how to prioritize time and resources to meet specific goals.</description>

      <title>Simulating Bell inequalities with Qibo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present educational material about Bell inequalities in the context of quantum computing. In particular, we provide software tools to simulate their violation, together with a guide for the classroom discussion. The material is organized in three modules of increasing difficulty, and the relative implementation has been written in Qibo, an open-source software suite to simulate quantum circuits with the ability to interface with quantum hardware. The topic of inequalities allows not only to introduce undergraduate or graduate students to crucial theoretical issues in quantum mechanics -- like entanglement, correlations, hidden variables, non-locality --, but also to practically put hands on tools to implement a real simulation, where statistical aspects and noise coming from current quantum chips also come into play.</description>
