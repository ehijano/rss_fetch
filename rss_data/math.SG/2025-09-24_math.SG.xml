      <title>Lagrangian Spheres and Cyclic Quotient T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lagrangian isotopy classification of Lagrangian spheres in the Milnor fibre, $B_{d,p,q}$, of the cyclic quotient surface T-singularity $\frac{1}{dp^2} (1,dpq-1)$. We prove that there is a finitely generated group of symplectomorphisms such that the orbit of a fixed Lagrangian sphere exhausts the set of Lagrangian isotopy classes. Previous classifications of Lagrangian spheres have been established in simpler symplectic $4$-manifolds, being either monotone, or simply connected, whilst the family studied here satisfies neither of these properties. We construct Lefschetz fibrations for which the Lagrangian spheres are isotopic to matching cycles, which reduces the problem to a computation involving the mapping class group of a surface. These fibrations are constructed using the techniques of $J$-holomorphic curves and Symplectic Field Theory, culminating in the construction of a $J$-holomorphic foliation by cylinders of $T^*S^2$. Our calculations provide evidence towards the symplectic mapping class group of $B_{d,p,q}$ being generated by Lagrangian sphere Dehn twists and another type of symplectomorphism arising as the monodromy of the $\frac{1}{p^2}(1,pq-1)$ singularity.</description>

      <title>A Bound on the Symplectic Systolic Ratio of Polytopes in Even-Dimensional Euclidean Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic capacities are invariants in symplectic geometry that are used to obstruct symplectic embeddings. From a certain symplectic capacity, the Ekeland-Hofer-Zehnder capacity, one can construct the systolic ratio, which measures the difference in the capacity and the Euclidean volume. The systolic ratio of a unit ball is always 1. It was conjectured by Viterbo that the systolic ratio is bounded by 1. This conjecture was disproven by Haim-Kislev recently, and now it is open to determine what bounds one may obtain on the systolic ratio if not 1. In this paper, the author investigates bounds on the systolic ratio of polytopes. In particular, a sharp bound on the systolic ratio of simplices in any dimension is obtained, with the dependence on dimension made explicit.</description>

      <title>Exact Lagrangian fillings of twist-spun torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exact Lagrangian fillings of Legendrian torus links $\Lambda(k, n-k)$ that are fixed by a Legendrian loop that acts by $2\pi\ell/n$ rotation. Using these rotationally symmetric fillings, we produce fillings of the corresponding Legendrian twist-spun tori. Our construction is combinatorial in nature, relating symmetric weakly separated collections and plabic graphs to symmetric Legendrian weaves via the T-shift procedure of Casals, Le, Sherman-Bennett, and Weng. The main technical ingredient in this process is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of maximal weakly separated collections of $k$-element subsets of $\{1, \dots, n\}$ that are fixed by addition of $\ell$ modulo $n$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Actions on Homogeneous Bounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines Hamiltonian actions of non-compact Lie groups on homogeneous bounded domains $X$ in $\mathbb{C}^d$. In the main part, a Lie-theoretical condition for closed subgroups $H$ of the automorphism group of $X$ is described such that the symplectic reduction $\mu^{-1}(0)/H$ for the momentum map $\mu$ is a Stein manifold. Moreover, for another class of closed subgroups it is shown that the quotient $(H^\mathbb{C}\cdot X)/H^\mathbb{C}$ is a Stein manifold and the symplectic reduction $\mu^{-1}(0)/H$ is biholomorphic to this quotient.</description>

      <title>A zoo of coisotropic embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the coisotropic embedding theorem obtained by M. J. Gotay for pre-symplectic manifolds to more general geometric settings: cosymplectic, contact, cocontact, $k$-symplectic, $k$-cosymplectic, $k$-contact, and multisymplectic manifolds. The results are obtained by applying a generic methodology, which gives more relevance to the potential applications. In that sense, this paper gives the fundamental basis to be able to apply the results to the so-called regularization problem of singular Lagrangian systems, both in mechanics and in classical field theories.</description>

      <title>A D-brane fantasy on noncommutative mirror symmetry, prelude: Noncommutative ringed spaces from local noncommutative crepant resolutions of a singular Calabi-Yau space, dynamical D-branes thereupon, and questions beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the world-sheet of a fundamental string, the world-volume of stacked D-branes carries an Azumaya noncommutative structure ([L-Y1: Sec.\ 2] (D(1))), allowing it to directly serve as a probe into noncommutative target-spaces. This feature leads to a D-brane fantasy: {\it Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry between noncommutative Calabi-Yau spaces may be realized as different realizations of a supersymmetric D-brane world-volume quantum field theory exactly like the string world-sheet aspect for Mirror Symmetry between (commutative) Calabi-Yau manifolds}. Driven by this fantasy, in the current notes a class of noncommutative ringed spaces shadowing over a $C^\infty$-manifold with corners are constructed from gluing local noncommutative crepant resolutions of Gorenstein isolated singularities. Dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative target-spaces are realized as maps/morphisms from an Azumaya manifold with a fundamental module with a connection $\nabla$ thereto. The notion of $\nabla$-adjusted kinetic energy for such a map is given via the basic noncommutative differential calculus developed earlier in [L-Y4] (D(11.1)). This provides an action functional for dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative spaces in parallel to the Polyakov action functional for fundamental bosonic strings on a commutative target-space. This sets up a basic stage to begin with for the realization of the D-brane fantasy on Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry. Questions beyond are sampled along the discussion.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Poisson $C^\infty$-rings and Poisson local $C^\infty$-ringed spaces. We show that the spectrum of a Poisson $C^\infty$-ring is an affine Poisson $C^\infty$-scheme. We then discuss applications that include singular symplectic and Poisson reductions, singular quasi-Poisson reduction, coisotropic reduction and Poisson-Dirac subschemes.</description>

      <title>Symplectic configurations: a homological and computer-aided approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulated a homological and computer-aided approach to study certain unions of symplectic surfaces, called symplectic configurations, in a rational $4$-manifold $X=CP^2\# N\overline{CP^2}$. We addressed several fundamental theoretical questions, and also as a technical device, developed a symplectic analog of the so-called quadratic Cremona transformations in complex algebraic geometry. As an application, we gave a new proof that a certain line arrangement in $CP^2$, called Fano planes, does not exist in the symplectic category. The nonexistence of Fano planes in the holomorphic category was due to Hirzebruch, and in the topological category, it was first proved by Ruberman and Starkston. Our proof in the symplectic category is independent to both.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <title>The $r$-matrix structure on the moduli space of framed Higgs pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11408v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the space of matrices with rational (trigonometric/elliptic) entries there is a well-known Lie-Poisson $r$-matrix structure. The known $r$-matrices are defined on the Riemann sphere (rational), the cylinder (trigonometric), or the torus (elliptic). We extend the formalism to the case of a Riemann surface $\mathcal C$ of higher genus $g$: we consider the moduli space of framed vector bundles of rank $n$ and degree $ng$, where the framing consists in a choice of basis of $n$ independent holomorphic sections chosen to trivialize the fiber at a given point $\infty\in \mathcal C$. The co-tangent space is known to be identified with the set of Higgs fields, i.e., one-forms on $\mathcal C$ with values in the endomorphisms of the vector bundle, with an additional simple pole at $\infty$. The natural symplectic structure on the co-tangent bundle of the moduli space induces a Poisson structure on the Higgs fields. The result is then an explicit $r$--matrix that generalizes the known ones. A detailed discussion of the elliptic case with comparison to the literature is also provided.</description>
