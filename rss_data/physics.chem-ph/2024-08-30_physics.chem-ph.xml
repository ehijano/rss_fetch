      <title>Conformal Coordinates for Molecular Geometry: from 3D to 5D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the conformal model (an extension of the homogeneous coordinate system) for molecular geometry, where 3D space is represented within R^5 with an inner product different from the usual one. This model enables efficient computation of interatomic distances using what we call the Conformal Coordinate Matrix (C-matrix). The C-matrix not only simplifies the mathematical framework but also reduces the number of operations required for distance calculations compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Combining Effective Hamiltonians and Brillouin-Wigner Approach: A Perturbative Approach to Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical cost of variational methods suggests using perturbative approaches to determine the electronic structure of molecular systems. In this work, a sequential construction of effective Hamiltonians drives the definition of approximate model functions and energies in a multi-state Rayleigh-Schr\"odinger perturbative scheme. A second step takes advantage of an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian to perform a state-specific Brillouin-Wigner energy correction based on a well-tempered perturbation expansion. The multi-step RSBW method is exemplified on model-Hamiltonians to stress its robustness, efficiency and applicability to spectroscopy determination.</description>

      <title>Mapping safety transitions as batteries degrade: A model-based analysis towards full-lifespan battery safety management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery safety is important, yet safety limits are normally static and do not evolve as batteries degrade. Consequently, many battery systems are overengineered to meet increasingly stringent safety demands. In this work we show that failure behaviour evolves over time as batteries degrade, and discuss the challenges and opportunities to manage battery safety dynamically throughout its lifetime. We introduce the first framework for capturing how the likelihood and severity of battery failures change over time based upon the concepts of safety zones and their boundaries. Through the development of a comprehensive physics-based model that integrates multiple degradation and thermal runaway failure mechanisms, we then show how the safety zones and boundaries of a commercial 21700 battery change after varied use and how these changes may lead to false negatives with existing management strategies. Further analyses reveal that degradation mechanisms strongly affect safety characteristics, causing significant changes despite similar capacity fade, highlighting the limitations of using capacity fade alone to assess batteries' usability. By synthesising our results with literature, we map possible degradation-to-failure pathways and recommend future research needs to achieve full-lifespan battery safety management, with advanced diagnostic and modelling techniques to accurately define state-of-safety for real-world applications as key priorities.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposed Distinguishable Cluster. I. Triples Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cost-reduced approach for the distinguishable cluster approximation to coupled cluster with singles, doubles and iterative triples (DC-CCSDT) based on a tensor decomposition of the triples amplitudes. The triples amplitudes and residuals are processed in the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) basis. Truncation of the SVD basis according to the values of the singular values together with the density fitting (or Choleski) factorization of the electron repulsion integrals reduces the scaling of the method to $N^6$, and the DC approximation removes the most expensive terms of the SVD triples residuals and at the same time improves the accuracy of the method. The SVD-basis vectors for the triples are obtained from the CC3 triples density matrices constructed using doubles amplitudes, which are also SVD-decomposed. This allows us to avoid steps that scale higher than $N^6$ altogether. Tests against DC-CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) on a benchmark set of chemical reactions with closed-shell molecules demonstrate that the SVD-error is very small already with moderate truncation thresholds, especially so when using a CCSD(T) energy correction. Tests on alkane chains demonstrated that the SVD error grows linearly with system size confirming the size extensivity of SVD-DC-CCSDT within a chosen truncation threshold.</description>

      <title>The relevance of degenerate states in chiral polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore theoretically whether a parity-violating/chiral light-matter interaction is required to capture all relevant aspects of chiral polaritonics or if a parity-conserving/achiral theory is sufficient (e.g. long-wavelength/dipole approximation). This question is non-trivial to answer, since achiral theories (Hamiltonians) still possess chiral solutions. To elucidate this fundamental theoretical question, a simple GaAs quantum ring model is coupled to an effective chiral mode of a single-handedness optical cavity in dipole approximation. The bare matter GaAs quantum ring possesses a non-degenerate ground state and a doubly degenerate first excited state. The chiral or achiral nature (superpositions) of the degenerate excited state remains undetermined for an isolated matter system. However, inside our parity-conserving description of a chiral cavity, we find that the dressed eigenstates automatically (ab-initio) attain chiral character and become energetically discriminated based on the handedness of the cavity. In contrast, the non-degenerate bare matter state (ground state) does not show an energetic discrimination inside a chiral cavity within dipole approximation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the handedness of the cavity can still be imprinted onto these states (e.g. angular momentum and chiral current densities). Overall, above findings highlight the relevance of degenerate states in chiral polaritonics. In particularly because recent theoretical results indicate the formation of a frustrated and highly-degenerate electronic ground-state under collective strong coupling conditions, which thus might be prone to chiral symmetry breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Universal bound states and resonances with Coulomb plus short-range potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06011v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study charged particles in three dimensions interacting via a short-range potential in addition to the Coulomb potential. When the Bohr radius and the scattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics of the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We develop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of the Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls boundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal their bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a repulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with increasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for an attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length. The zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at infinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles induced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances shorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas shallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Influence of Nonequilibrium Vibrational Dynamics on Spin Selectivity in Chiral Molecular Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of molecular vibrations in the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in the context of charge transport through a molecular nanojunction. We employ a mixed quantum-classical approach that combines Ehrenfest dynamics for molecular vibrations with the hierarchical equations of motion method for the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach treats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial for the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of vibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of merit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in vibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the dynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends on voltage and electronic-vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We demonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational polarization, indicating that dynamics of the molecular vibrations is the driving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.</description>

      <title>A transition state resonance radically reshapes angular distributions of the F + H2 -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction in the 62.09-101.67 meV energy range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive angular distributions of the benchmark F + H2(vi = 0) -&gt; F H(vf = 3) + H reaction show unusual propensity towards small scattering angles, a subject of a long debate in the literature. We use Regge trajectories to quantify the resonance contributions to state-to-state differential cross sections. Conversion to complex energy poles allows us to attribute the effect almost exclusively to a transition state resonance, long known to exist in the F +H2 system and its isotopic variant F +HD. For our detailed analysis of angular scattering we employ the package DCS Regge, recently developed for the purpose [Comp. Phys. Comm., 2022, 277, 108370.]</description>

      <title>Group Conductivity and Nonadiabatic Born Effective Charges of Disordered Metals, Warm Dense Matter and Hot Dense Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The average ionization state is a critical parameter in plasma models for charged particle transport, equation of state, and optical response. The dynamical or nonadiabatic Born effective charge (NBEC), calculated via first principles time-dependent density functional theory, provides exact ionic partitioning of bulk electron response for both metallic and insulating materials. The NBEC can be trivially transformed into a ''group conductivity", that is, the electron conductivity ascribed to a subset of ions. We show that for disordered metallic systems, such as warm dense matter (WDM) and hot dense plasma, the static limit of the NBEC is different from the average ionization state, but that the ionization state can be extracted from the group conductivity even in mixed systems. We demonstrate this approach using a set of archetypical examples, including cold and warm aluminium, low- and high- density WDM carbon, and a WDM carbon-beryllium-hydrogen mixture.</description>

      <title>Exchange kernel $f^h_x(q,\omega)$ of electron liquid from the variational principle of McLachlan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By minimizing, in the $L_2$ norm, the difference between the left- and the right-hand sides of the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation, the variational principle of McLachlan (McLVP) [A. McLachlan, Molecular Physics {\bf 8}, 39 (1964)] provides a powerful tool for the generation of equations of motion. If the trial wave function is the Slater determinant, McLVP produces a temporally and spatially nonlocal exchange potential [V. U. Nazarov, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 87}, 165125 (2013)]. We study the performance of the corresponding wave-vector and frequency-dependent exchange kernel $f^h_x(q,\omega)$ of the homogeneous electron liquid. While the McLVP-based $f^h_x(q,\omega)$ lacks correlations by construction, we find that it accurately accounts for exchange, reproducing features in the quantum Monte Carlo data, which the known constraint-based kernels miss. We argue that the complementary use of the McLVP- and the constraint-based exchange-correlation kernels will enhance the performance of the linear response time-dependent density functional theory of the electron liquid.</description>

      <title>Convective Instability Driven by Diffusiophoresis of Colloids in Binary Liquid Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a binary fluid mixture, the concentration gradient of a heavier molecular solute leads to a diffusive flux of solvent and solute to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. If the solute concentration decreases with height, the system is always in a condition of stable mechanical equilibrium against gravity. We show experimentally that this mechanical equilibrium becomes unstable in case colloidal particles are dispersed uniformly within the mixture, and that the resulting colloidal suspension undergoes a transient convective instability with the onset of convection patterns. By means of a numerical analysis, we clarify the microscopic mechanism from which the observed destabilisation process originates. The solute concentration gradient drives an upward diffusiophoretic migration of colloids, in turn causing the development of a mechanically unstable layer within the sample, where the density of the suspension increases with height. Convective motions arise to minimize this localized rise in gravitational potential energy.</description>

      <title>Universal mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Thermodynamically favourable reactions such as ATP hydrolysis are used by the cell to convert chemical energy into useful structure, function, and mechanical work. This includes the `fuelled' catalysis of chemical reactions that would otherwise be thermodynamically unfavourable. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. Here, we present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. By considering the different aspects of the dynamics, such as the interplay of the non-equilibrium drive and the geometry of the enzyme-substrate complex, we propose three golden rules that should be universally applicable for de novo design of enzymes, as they are based on generic ingredients and physical constraints. These rules lead to optimal combinations of parameters, which can vastly accelerate reactions, while at the same time decreasing the energy dissipation of the combined reaction process, or, in other words, to an efficient enzyme. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

Abstract: Laser spectroscopy and interferometry have provided an unparalleled view into the fundamental nature of matter and the universe through ultra-precise measurements of atomic transition frequencies and gravitational waves. Optical frequency combs have expanded metrology capabilities by phase-coherently bridging radio frequency and optical domains to enable traceable high-resolution spectroscopy across bandwidths greater than hundreds of terahertz. However, quantum mechanics limits the measurement precision achievable with laser frequency combs and traditional laser sources, ultimately impacting fundamental interferometry and spectroscopy. Squeezing the distribution of quantum noise to enhance measurement precision of either the amplitude or phase quadrature of an optical field leads to significant measurement improvements with continuous wave lasers. In this work, we generate bright amplitude-squeezed frequency comb light and apply it to molecular spectroscopy using interferometry that leverages the high-speed and broad spectral coverage of the dual-comb technique. Using the Kerr effect in nonlinear optical fiber, the amplitude quadrature of a frequency comb centered at 1560 nm is squeezed by &gt;3 dB over a 2.5 THz of bandwidth that includes 2500 comb teeth spaced by 1 GHz. Interferometry with a second coherent state frequency comb yields mode-resolved spectroscopy of hydrogen sulfide gas with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nearly 3 dB beyond the shot noise limit, taking full metrological advantage of the amplitude squeezing when the electrical noise floor is considered. The quantum noise reduction leads to a two-fold quantum speedup in the determination of gas concentration, with impact for fast, broadband, and high SNR ratio measurements of multiple species in dynamic chemical environments.</description>

      <title>Gibbs free energies of Fe clusters can be approximated by Tolman correction to accurately model cluster nucleation and growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate Gibbs free energies of Fe clusters are required for predictive modeling of Fe cluster growth during condensation of a cooling vapor. We present a straightforward method of calculating free energies of cluster formation using the data provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply this method to calculate free energies of Fe clusters having from 2 to 100 atoms. The free energies are verified by comparing to an MD-simulated equilibrium cluster size distribution in a sub-saturated vapor. We show that these free energies differ significantly from those obtained with a commonly used spherical cluster approximation - which relies on a surface tension coefficient of a flat surface. The spherical cluster approximation can be improved by using a cluster size-dependent Tolman correction for the surface tension. The values for the Tolman length and effective surface tension were derived, which differ from the commonly used experimentally measured surface tension based on the potential energy. This improved approximation does not account for geometric magic number effects responsible for spikes and troughs in densities of neighbor cluster sizes. Nonetheless, it allows to model cluster formation from a cooling vapor and accurately reproduce the condensation timeline, overall shape of the cluster size distribution, average cluster size, and the distribution width. Using a constant surface tension coefficient resulted in distorted condensation dynamics and inaccurate cluster size distributions.

      <title>Force-Guided Bridge Matching for Full-Atom Time-Coarsened Dynamics of Peptides</title>

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are irreplaceable and ubiquitous in fields of materials science, chemistry, pharmacology just to name a few. Conventional MD simulations are plagued by numerical stability as well as long equilibration time issues, which limits broader applications of MD simulations. Recently, a surge of deep learning approaches have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which learns the state transition mechanism over much larger time scales to overcome these limitations. However, only a few methods target the underlying Boltzmann distribution by resampling techniques, where proposals are rarely accepted as new states with low efficiency. In this work, we propose a force-guided bridge matching model, FBM, a novel framework that first incorporates physical priors into bridge matching for full-atom time-coarsened dynamics. With the guidance of our well-designed intermediate force field, FBM is feasible to target the Boltzmann-like distribution by direct inference without extra steps. Experiments on small peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and demonstrate transferability to unseen peptide systems.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics in a non-equilibrium regime: Application to Stirling engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed a thermodynamic theory in the non-equilibrium regime, which we describe as a thermodynamic system-bath model [S. Koyanagi and Y. Tanimura, J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{160}, 234112 (2024)]. Based on the dimensionless (DL) minimum work principle, non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials are expressed in terms of non-equilibrium extensive and intensive variables in time derivative form. This is made possible by incorporating the entropy production rate into the definitions of non-equilibrium thermodynamic potentials. These potentials can be evaluated from the DL non-equilibrium-to-equilibrium minimum work principle, which is derived from the principle of DL minimum work and is equivalent to the second law of thermodynamics. We thus obtain the non-equilibrium Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the non-equilibrium Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energies. Unlike fluctuation theorem and stochastic thermodynamics theory, this theory does not require the assumption of a factorized initial condition and is valid in the full quantum regime where the system and bath are quantum mechanically entangled. Our results are numerically verified by simulating a thermostatic Stirling engine consisting of two isothermal processes and two thermostatic processes using the quantum hierarchical Fokker--Planck equations and the classical Kramers equation derived from the thermodynamic system-bath model. We then show that, from weak to strong system-bath interactions, the thermodynamic process can be analyzed using a non-equilibrium work diagram analogous to the equilibrium one for given time-dependent intensive variables. The results can be used to develop efficient heat machines in non-equilibrium regimes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on exotic interactions from scalar spin-spin coupling in tritium deuteride (DT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A comparison of theoretical and experimental values of the scalar spin-spin interaction ($J$-coupling) in tritium deuteride molecules yield constraints for nucleon-nucleon exotic interactions of the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_Vg_V$, $g_Ag_A$ and $g_pg_p$, corresponding to the exchange of an vector, axial-vector, and pseudoscalar (axionlike) boson. The couplings between proton ($p$) and nucleon ($N$), denoted by $g_V^p g_V^N$, $g_p^p g_p^N$ are constrained to be less than $1.4 \times 10^{-6}$ and $2.7\times 10^{-6}$, respectively, for boson masses around 5 keV. The coupling constant $g_A^p g_A^N$ is constrained to be less than $1.0 \times 10^{-18}$ for boson masses $\leq 100$ eV. It is noteworthy that this study represents the first instance in which constraints on $g_V g_V$ have been established through the analysis of the potential term $V_2 + V_3$ for both tritium deuteride and hydrogen deuteride molecules.</description>
