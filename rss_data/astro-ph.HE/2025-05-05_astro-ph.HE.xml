      <title>Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have recently found strong evidence for low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) in the nanohertz frequency regime. As GWs pass, they produce deviations in measured lengths and light-travel times. PTA experiments utilize the highly-consistent radio bursts from millisecond pulsars, distributed throughout the local galaxy, to identify miniscule timing deviations indicative of GWs. To distinguish GWs from noise, PTAs search for a particular correlation pattern between different pulsars called Hellings &amp; Downs correlations. The type of GW signal that has recently been identified is a stochastic GW background (GWB), which is observed to have more power at lower GW frequencies. A GWB matching these observations has long been predicted from super-massive black-hole (SMBH) binaries. SMBHs are known to exist in the centers of galaxies, which can then form binaries when two SMBHs are brought together following the merger of galaxies. No example of an SMBH binary has confidently been identified to date, and tremendous uncertainties about their formation and evolution remain. Alternative sources of the GWB have also been proposed, based on models for new fundamental physics, particularly in the early Universe. Improved sensitivity of PTAs will eventual lead to the characterization of GWB anisotropy and constraints on GWs from individual SMBH binaries, either of which could definitively demonstrate the true origin of the GWB. If the source is SMBH binaries, a variety of electromagnetic counterparts are possible, allowing for multimessenger astrophysics with low-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization study of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GX 349+2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first X-ray polarimetric results of the neutron star (NS) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) Z-source GX 349+2 using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We discovered that the X-ray source was polarized at PD = 1.1 +/- 0.3% (1-sigma errors) with a polarization angle of PA = 32 +/- 6 degree (1-sigma errors). Simultaneous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations show that the source transitioned through the normal branch (NB), flaring branch (FB), and soft apex (SA) of the Z-track during our IXPE observations. The X-ray spectro-polarimetry results suggest a source geometry comprising an accretion disk component, a blackbody representing the emission from the NS surface, and a Comptonized component. We discuss the accretion geometry of the Z source in light of the spectro-polarimetric results.</description>

      <title>Connecting afterglow light curves to the GRB central engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow light curves have the potential to inform us about presently unobserved stages in the aftermath of a neutron star merger. Using numerical simulations of short GRB afterglows we obtain an approximate quantitative connection between key aspects of the emission mechanism and the shapes of the resulting light curves. Employing simple, but efficient, parameterizations of the light curve based on a broken power law in terms of physical parameters, fitted to a large dataset of synthetic light curves, we apply basic machine learning techniques to determine the approximate connection between key input parameters of the forward shock model and the light curve parameters. Solving then the inverse problem, we find that the strength of the central engine can be reasonably accurately estimated even with very limited information. In particular, merely the position of jet-break in the on-axis, respectively the maximum in the off-axis light curve determines the kinetic energy at the tens of percent level.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</description>

      <title>QPO signatures of disk restoration after type-I X-ray bursts from 4U~1636$-$536</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I thermonuclear bursts (TNBs) from neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NSLMXBs) originate on the neutron star's surface from the unstable burning of the accreted material. On the other hand, kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are thought to originate in the innermost regions of the in-spiraling accretion disk. Due to the violent nature of the bursts, it is anticipated that Type-I TNBs will impact the inner accretion flow, and, therefore, the kHz QPOs. In this work, we systematically study the evolution of the upper and the lower kHz QPOs immediately before and after a Type-I TNB on 4U 1636$-$536 using {\it{AstroSat}} observations in the 3--20 keV band. The analysis of the power-density-spectra show the presence of kHz QPOs within 200 seconds before the onset of the Type--I burst. However, we have not detected any prominent signature of the same within 100-200 second posterior to the burst. The kHz QPOs then re-emerges after $\approx$ 200 sec. The fractional rms variation in the 3--20 keV band drops by $\approx$ 5-6 \%, supporting the non-existence of kHz QPOs in the 200 sec post-Burst Zone. The time scale of 200 sec coincides with the viscous time scale, highlighting a scenario where the inner disk is temporarily disrupted by the intense radiation from the Type-I TNB. The kHz QPO then re-establishes as the inner disk is restored.</description>

      <title>Charged Anisotropic Pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 in Non-Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of charge on the stability of the pulsar star SAX J1748.9-2021 within the context of $f(\mathbb{Q}, \mathcal{T})$ theory, where $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ represent the non-metricity scalar and the energy-momentum tensor, respectively. To achieve this, we employ the Krori-Barua metric ansatz with anisotropic fluid. We obtain exact relativistic solutions for the corresponding field equations. Additionally, we examine its physical and geometric properties using astrophysical observations of the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021. This approach provides a basis for connecting several physical quantities, including fluid parameters, anisotropy, mass-radius relationship, compactness, redshift, \emph{energy}, the Zeldovich and causality conditions, equation of state parameter, adiabatic index and the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. Our findings align with observational evidence, indicating that the pulsar SAX J1748.9-2021 remains both feasible and stable under this modified theory.</description>

      <title>No-hair theorems in General Relativity and scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present review, we consider the status of the classification of the vacuum, stationary and asymptotically flat black holes in scalar-tensor gravity. Contrary to the similar problem in general relativity, the black hole classification in scalar-tensor theories is much more challenging due to the very complicated character of the field equations and the very complex mathematical structure of the scalar-tensor gravity as a whole. We review most of the known no-hair results, and where possible new ones, as well demonstrate some of the difficulties that appear in our attempts to classify the black holes within scalar-tensor gravity. The proofs of the theorems and the underlying mathematical techniques are given in sufficient detail. To make the review self-contained we also present the vacuum black hole uniqueness theorems in general relativity and their proofs.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbit of arbitrary-mass compact binaries at fourth post-Newtonian order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute by means of post-Newtonian (PN) methods the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of arbitrary-mass (in particular, comparable-mass) compact binaries. Two methods are used with equivalent results: dynamical perturbation of the conservative equations of motion in harmonic coordinates, and dynamical perturbation of the conservative Hamiltonian in ADM coordinates. The perturbation of the non-local tail term at 4PN order in both approaches is carefully investigated. Our final gauge invariant result for the location of the ISCO at 4PN order is close to the numerical value of the ISCO shift computed by the gravitational self-force (GSF) approach in the small mass-ratio limit, and is also in good agreement with the full numerical-relativity calculation in the case of equal masses. The PN method followed here is considered in standard Taylor-expanded form, without any resummation techniques applied. As a complement, we also compute explicitly the gauge transformation from harmonic coordinates to ADM coordinates up to 4PN order, including the tail contribution therein.</description>

      <title>Spin Precession in magnetized Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of spin precession for a test gyroscope in the magnetized Kerr spacetime--an exact electrovacuum solution to the Einstein-Maxwell equations. Our approach accommodates arbitrary magnetic field strengths, enabling a unified treatment across both weak and ultra-strong field regimes. The analysis reveals distinct spin precession behaviors near rotating collapsed objects, which differ characteristically between black holes and naked singularities, offering a potential observational means to differentiate them. The external magnetic field induces a nontrivial modification of the precession frequency through its interaction with the spacetime's gravitoelectromagnetic structure. In the weak-field limit, magnetic fields generally reduce the precession rate, though the effect depends sensitively on the motion and orientation of the test gyro close to the collapsed object. As a special case, we show that in the presence of magnetic fields, the spin precession frequency due to gravitomagnetic effect acquires a long-range $1/r$ (where $r$ is the distance from the central object to the test gyro) correction in contrast to the standard $1/r^3$ falloff. In addition, we obtain the exact geodetic precession (gravitoelectric effect) frequency in magnetized Schwarzschild spacetime, showing that the magnetic field enhances ($\propto r^{1/2}$) geodetic precession in contrast to the standard $1/r^{5/2}$ falloff. Our results provide observationally testable predictions relevant for black holes in strong magnetic environments, including those possibly realized near magnetars or in the early universe. In particular, the strong-field behavior of spin precession could have important implications for transmuted black holes formed via collapse or mergers of magnetized progenitors in both astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>New gravitational waveform model for precessing binary neutron stars with double-spin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two new frequency-domain gravitational waveform models for the analysis of signals emitted by binary neutron star coalescences: IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalv2 and IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2. Both models are available through the public algorithm library LALSuite and represent the first extensions of IMRPhenomX models including matter effects. We show here that these two models represent a significant advancement in efficiency and accuracy with respect to their phenomenological predecessors, IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2 and IMRPhenomPv2_NRTidalv2. The computational efficiency of the new models is achieved through the application of the same multibanding technique previously applied to binary black hole models. Furthermore, IMRPhenomXP_NRTidalv2 implements a more accurate description of the precession dynamics, including double-spin effects and, optionally, matter effects in the twisting-up construction. The latter are available through an option to use a numerical integration of the post-Newtonian precession equations. We show that the new precession descriptions allow the model to better reproduce the phenomenology observed in numerical-relativity simulations of precessing binary neutron stars. Finally, we present some applications of the new models to Bayesian parameter estimation studies, including a reanalysis of GW170817 and a study of simulated observations using numerical relativity waveforms for nonprecessing binary neutron stars with highly spinning components. We find that in these cases the new models make a negligible difference in the results. Nevertheless, by virtue of the aforementioned improvements, the new models represent valuable tools for the study of future detections of coalescing binary neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of the supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A* by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) have opened new avenues for testing gravity theories through black hole shadow observables. These observations offer a means to distinguish between general relativity and modified gravity theories while providing insights into the astrophysical properties of the observed black holes. In this work, we investigate photon orbits and shadow characteristics of rotating black holes within the Einstein-$\mathrm{SU}(N)$ nonlinear sigma model. We first analyze the static, spherically symmetric black hole solution, focusing on its asymptotically Anti-de Sitter behavior and causal structure. The Modified Newman-Janis Algorithm is then applied to obtain the rotating counterpart, followed by an examination of its geometric properties, ergoregions, and causal structure. Utilizing the Lagrangian formalism, we derive the equations of motion for photons and study the resulting black hole shadow on the celestial plane. We explore the dependence of the shadow's size and shape on the black hole parameters $K$ and $N$, imposing constraints using EHT observational data for M87* and Sgr A*. Finally, we analyze the black hole's evaporation rate under different scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Trinity of black hole correspondences: Shadows-quasinormal modes-graybody factors and cautionary remarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correspondences between apparently distant concepts are ubiquitous in theoretical physics. In the context of Black Holes (BHs), Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) were shown to be linked to both shadows, in the so-called eikonal limit, and Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), using the WKB approximation. We test the accuracy of the QNM-GBF correspondence in the context of the Hawking radiation for static and rotating black hole configurations, with particular attention to the superradiant regime. Our analysis reveals the correspondence failure to accurately reproduce the Hawking spectrum due to divergences. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between BH shadows and GBFs by drawing a correspondence between such quantities in the case of generic static and spherically symmetric spacetime configurations. The shadow-GBF correspondence is tested for some case studies, including regular BHs, and its limitations and applicability are discussed. This study opens new perspectives by introducing a new correspondence and remarking on the caution needed when considering these connections.</description>
