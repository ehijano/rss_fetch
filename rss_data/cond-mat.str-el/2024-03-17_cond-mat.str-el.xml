      <title>Perturbative description of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in the Hubbard model via unitary transformation and classical spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unitary transformation is applied to the Hubbard model, which maps the Hubbard interaction to a single particle term. The resulting Hamiltonian consists of unconstrained fermions, which is then mapped to a Hamiltonian of spinless fermions coupled to pseudospins. The fermions are integrated out using second order perturbation theory in $1/U$, resulting in an effective spin Hamiltonian. An order parameter is identified, stabilizing d-wave superconductivity. The groundstate energy of classical spin configurations is minimized at a finite value of this order parameter after a critical chemical potential, resulting in d-wave superconductivity at non-zero doping. This suggests, that the onset of high-$T_c$ superconductivity is governed by the groundstate of a classical spin system.</description>

      <title>Kitaev physics in the two-dimensional magnet NiPSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev interaction, found in candidate materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, occurs through the metal ($M$)-ligand ($X$)-metal ($M$) paths of the edge-sharing octahedra because the large spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the metal atoms activates directional spin interactions. Here, we show that even in $3d$ transition-metal compounds, where the SOC of the metal atom is negligible, heavy ligands can induce bond-dependent Kitaev interactions. In this work, we take as an example the $3d$ transition-metal chalcogenophosphate NiPSe$_3$ and show that the key is found in the presence of a sizable SOC on the Se $p$ orbital, one which mediates the super-exchange between the nearest-neighbor Ni sites. Our study provides a pathway for engineering enhanced Kitaev interactions through the interplay of SOC strength, lattice distortions, and chemical substitutions.</description>

      <title>Fermi Liquid near a q=0 Charge Quantum Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the quasiparticle interaction function (the fully dressed and antisymmetrized interaction between fermions) for a two-dimensional Fermi liquid at zero temperature close to a q=0 charge quantum critical point (QCP) in the $s-$wave channel. By the Ward identities, this vertex function must be related to quasiparticle residue $Z$, which can be obtained independently from the fermionic self-energy. We show that to satisfy these Ward identities, one needs to go beyond the standard diagrammatic formulation of Fermi liquid theory and include series of additional contributions to the vertex function. These contributions are forbidden in a conventional Fermi liquid, but do emerge near a QCP, where the effective 4-fermion interaction is mediated by a soft dynamical boson. We demonstrate explicitly that including these terms restores the Ward identity. We also discuss the role of Aslamazov-Larkin-type diagrams for the vertex function. Our analysis is built on works on the vertex function near an antiferromagnetic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 89, 045108 (2014)] and a d-wave charge-nematic QCP [Phys. Rev. B 81, 045110 (2010)]. We show that for $s-$wave charge QCP (the one leading to phase separation), the analysis is more straightforward. We also discuss the structure of the Landau function in a critical Fermi liquid near a QCP.</description>

      <title>Spiral to stripe transition in the two-dimensional Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an almost complete understanding of the mean-field phase diagram of the two-dimensional Hubbard model on a square lattice with a sizable next-nearest neighbor hopping and a moderate interaction strength. In particular, we clarify the nature of the transition region between the spiral and the stripe phase. Complementing previous [Phys. Rev. B 108, 035139 (2023)] real-space Hartree-Fock calculations on large finite lattices, we solve the mean-field equations for coplanar unidirectional magnetic order directly in the thermodynamic limit, and we determine the nature of the magnetic states right below the mean-field critical temperature $T^*$ by a Landau free energy analysis. While the magnetic order for filling factors $n \geq 1$ is always of N\'eel type, for $n \leq 1$ the following sequence of magnetic states is found as a function of increasing hole-doping: N\'eel, planar circular spiral, multi-spiral, and collinear spin-charge stripe states. Multi-spiral states are superpositions of several spirals with distinct wave vectors, and lead to concomitant charge order. We finally point out that nematic and charge orders inherited from the magnetic order can survive even in the presence of fluctuations, and we present a corresponding qualitative phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Electron screening and strength of long-range Coulomb interactions in phosphorene: From bulk to nanoribbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental observations of anisotropic tightly bound excitons in black phosphorene, and correlated phenomena such as room temperature magnetically active edges in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs), sparked discussions on the controversial screening of the Coulomb interaction in phosphorene-based materials. In this way, we investigate the first-principles electronic screening of the long-range Coulomb interaction in phosphorene from bulk to nanoribbon by employing ab initio calculations in conjunction with the constrained random-phase approximation. The bands near Fermi energy (E_F) are predominantly pz orbital characters, and due to the puckering, they are not well separated from the other bands with s, px, and specially py characters. This proximity in energy levels increases the contribution of px/py $\rightarrow$ pz transitions to the polarization function and significantly alters the Coulomb parameters. In semiconducting systems, the on-site Coulomb interaction values (Hubbard U) range from 4.1 to 6.5 eV and depend on the correlated subspace, electronic structure, nanoribbon's width, and edge passivation. Our long-range interaction has revealed a non-conventional screening in semiconducting nanoribbons. We have discovered that screening actually enhances the electron-hole interaction for separations larger than a critical distance r_c, which is contrary to what was previously seen in conventional semiconductors. In unpassivated zigzag nanoribbons, due to a metallic screening channel stemming from quasi-flat edge bands at E_F, we find U/W_b &gt; 1 (the bandwidth W_b) and large gradient of inter-site Coulomb interactions, making them correlated materials. We have investigated the instability of the paramagnetic state of bare ZPNRs toward ferromagnetism using a Stoner model based on the calculated Hubbard U parameters.</description>

      <title>Polarized Charge Dynamics of a Novel Charge Density Wave in Kagome FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of kagome FeGe, an antiferromagnet with a charge density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\mathrm{CDW}} \simeq 105$ K, using polarized infrared spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We reveal a pronounced optical anisotropy, various excitations associated with flat bands and van Hove singularities (VHSs), and a moderate level of electronic correlations. Notably, there are two types of remarkable spectral weight (SW) redistributions for above and below $T_{\mathrm{CDW}}$. The former involves a transfer between incoherent and coherent excitations driven by the magnetic splitting-induced elevation of flat bands. The latter manifests itself as a sudden change of SW from low to high energies for both $a$ and $c$ directions, suggesting a first-order transition and the three-dimensional nature of CDW. These anomalies in SW significantly differ from those observed in other kagome metals like CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, where the nesting of VHSs results in a pronounced CDW gap feature. Instead, our findings can be accounted for by the jump of VHSs relative to the Fermi energy via a first-order structural transition involving large partial Ge1-dimerization. Our study thus unveils a complex interplay among structure, magnetism, electronic correlations, and charge order in FeGe, offering valuable insights for a comprehensive understanding of CDW order in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Modeling, Multi-magnon condensation and Strain effect in chain compound NaVOPO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing first-principles modelling and many-body methods, the magnetic properties of spin-1/2 chain compound NaVOPO$_4$ are explored. The extensive first-principles calculations establish an intricate three-dimensionally coupled model that consists of weakly alternating $J$-$J^{'}$ antiferromagnetic chains running along cris-cross directions between two consecutive $ab$ planes, connected via two subleading couplings, a ferromagnetic exchange along the $c$ direction ($J_c$) and a weaker antiferromagnetic exchange ($J_a$) along the body diagonal direction. The exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalized group study have been carried out on a two-dimensional spin model with $J$-$J^{'}$-$J_c$ and effective $J_d$ couplings, constructed based on the full model, for numerical ease. The $J_c$-$J_d$ phase diagram is found to host a {\it disorder} phase with finite spin gap for comparable values of $J_c$ and $J_d$, arising out of the competing nature of these two interactions, other than two ordered phases. The predominant manifestation of $J_c$ and $J_d$ in the disorder phase happens in stabilisation of a multi-magnon condensed phase, upon gap closing by application of an external magnetic field. We further explore the effect of tensile uniaxial strain, which is found to drive the system from gapful to gapless ground state.</description>

      <title>Nonmagnetic Ground State in RuO$_2$ Revealed by Muon Spin Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic ground state of single crystalline RuO$_2$ was investigated by the muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) experiment. The spin precession signal due to the spontaneous internal magnetic field $B_{\rm loc}$, which is expected in the magnetically ordered phase, was not observed in the temperature range 5--400~K. Muon sites were evaluated by first-principles calculations using dilute hydrogen simulating muon as pseudo-hydrogen, and $B_{\rm loc}$ was simulated for the antiferromagnetic (AFM) structures with a Ru magnetic moment $|{\bf m}_{\rm Ru}|\approx0.05\mu_\mathrm{B}$ suggested from diffraction experiments. As a result, the possibility was ruled out that muons are localized at sites where $B_{\rm loc}$ accidentally cancels. Conversely, assuming that the slow relaxation observed in $\mu$SR spectra was part of the precession signal, the upper limit for the magnitude of $|{\bf m}_{\rm Ru}|$ was estimated to be $4.8(2)\times10^{-4}\mu_{\rm B}$, which is significantly less than $0.05\mu_\mathrm{B}$. These results indicate that the AFM order, as reported, is unlikely to exist in the bulk crystal.</description>

      <title>Disordered non-Fermi liquid fixed point for two-dimensional metals at Ising-nematic quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the influence of quenched random potential is crucial for comprehending the exotic electronic transport of non-Fermi liquid metals near metallic quantum critical points. In this study, we identify a stable fixed point governing the quantum critical behavior of two-dimensional non-Fermi liquid metals in the presence of a random potential disorder. By performing renormalization group analysis on a dimensional-regularized field theory for Ising-nematic quantum critical points, we systematically investigate the interplay between random potential disorder for electrons and Yukawa-type interactions between electrons and bosonic order-parameter fluctuations in a perturbative epsilon expansion. At the one-loop order, the effective field theory lacks stable fixed points, instead exhibiting a runaway flow toward infinite disorder strength. However, at the two-loop order, the effective field theory converges to a stable fixed point characterized by finite disorder strength, termed the "disordered non-Fermi liquid (DNFL) fixed point." Our investigation reveals that two-loop vertex corrections induced by Yukawa couplings are pivotal in the emergence of the DNFL fixed point, primarily through screening disorder scattering. Additionally, the DNFL fixed point is distinguished by a substantial anomalous scaling dimension of fermion fields, resulting in pseudogap-like behavior in the electron's density of states. These findings shed light on the quantum critical behavior of disordered non-Fermi liquid metals, emphasizing the indispensable role of higher-order loop corrections in such comprehension.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous spin chirality reversal and competing phases in the topological magnet EuAl$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the spontaneous reversal of spin chirality in a single crystal sample of the intermetallic magnet EuAl$_4$. We solve the nanoscopic nature of each of the four magnetically phases of EuAl$_4$ using resonant magnetic x-ray scattering, and demonstrate all four phases order with single-k incommensurate magnetic modulation vectors. Below 15.4 K the system forms a spin density modulated spin structure where the spins are orientated in the ab plane perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic propagation vector. Below 13.2 K a second spin density wave orders with moments aligned parallel to the c-axis, such that the two spin density wave orders coexist. Below 12.2 K a magnetic helix of a single chirality is stabilised across the entire sample. Below 10 K the chirality of the magnetic helix reverses, and the sample remains a single chiral domain. Concomitant with the establishment of the helical magnetic ordering is the lowering of the crystal symmetry to monoclinic, as evidenced the formation of uniaxial charge and spin strip domains. A group theoretical analysis demonstrates that below 12.2 K the symmetry lowers to polar monoclinic, which is necessary to explain the observed asymmetry in the chiral states of the magnetic helix and the spin chiral reversal. We find that in every magnetically ordered phase of EuAl4 the in-plane moment is perpendicular to the orientation of the magnetic propagation vector, which we demonstrate is favoured by magnetic dipolar interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive research has focused on phenomena arising from the chirality of crystalline or magnetic structures. Recently, we have proposed the "Nonlinear Chiral Thermo-Electric (NCTE) Hall effect," in which current flows in the direction of the cross product of the electric field and the temperature gradient in a material with a chiral structure. Despite its importance for device applications such as heat flow sensors and logic circuits, there are no quantitative demonstrations in actual materials. We investigate the NCTE Hall effect and the second-order response to the electric field in Te, which hosts the chiral crystal structure, based on $ab \ initio$ calculations and symmetry argument. We clarify that the NCTE Hall current can flow parallel to the chiral axis, whereas such behavior is absent for the second-order response to the DC electric field. Quantitative estimation predicts the large NCTE Hall current which is sufficiently detectable in experiments, and the orbital magnetic moment will play an important role in the vicinity of the top of the valence band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variational wave function to represent quantum skyrmions as bosonic operators. The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a "quantum cloud" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases which, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic metals taking into account the presence of substrate-induced Rashba spin-orbit coupling. We consider the altermagnet bandstructure using a 2D band Hamiltonian near the $\Gamma$ point under external magnetic field. It is shown that time-reversal-symmetry breaking due to altermagnetism, together with Rashba coupling and external magnetic field, can result in non-trivial band topology. The topological phases can be tuned by magnetic field strength and directions, and are classified by their Chern numbers. Furthermore, we investigate the charge response by computing the full optical conductivity tensor with and without magnetic field. In particular, we focus on magneto-optical responses, which are the finite-frequency analog of the Berry curvature-induced anomalous Hall conductivity. Finally, using experimentally realistic parameters for RuO$_2$, we estimate the Faraday angle in the absence of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Linear-in-temperature resistivity and Planckian dissipation arise in a stochastic quantization model of Cooper pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suppose that a Cooper pair (CP) will experience a damping force exerted by the condensed matter. A Langevin equation of a CP in two dimensional condensed matter is established. Following a method similar to Nelson's stochastic mechanics, generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation of a CP in condensed matter is derived. If the CPs move with a constant velocity, then the corresponding direct current (DC) electrical conductivity can be calculated. Therefore, a Drude like formula of resistivity of CPs is derived. We suppose that the damping coefficient of CPs in two dimensional cuprate superconductors is a linear function of temperature. Then the resistivity and scattering rate of CPs turn out to be also linear-in-temperature. The origin of linear-in-temperature resistivity and Planckian dissipation in cuprate superconductors may be the linear temperature dependence of the damping coefficient of CPs.</description>

Abstract: Here we study nonmonotonic features which appear both in magnetoresistivity and anomalous Hall resistivity during the simple magnetization process, by systematically measuring type-II magnetic Weyl semimetal EuCd$_2$Sb$_2$ films over a wide carrier density range. We find that a positive magnetoresistivity hump can be explained as manifestation of a field-linear term in the generalized magnetoconductivity formula including the Berry curvature. As also confirmed by model calculation, the term can be negative and pronounced near the Weyl point energy in the case that the Weyl cones are heavily tilted.

      <title>Topological frequency conversion in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family, we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net amplification.</description>

      <title>Sequential measurements thermometry with quantum many-body probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the temperature of a quantum system is an essential task in almost all aspects of quantum technologies. Theoretically, an optimal strategy for thermometry requires measuring energy which demands full accessibility over the entire system as well as complex entangled measurement basis. In this paper, we take a different approach and show that single qubit sequential measurements in the computational basis not only allows precise thermometry of a many-body system but may also achieve precision beyond the theoretical bound, avoiding demanding energy measurements at equilibrium. To obtain such precision, the time between the two subsequent measurements should be smaller than the thermalization time so that the probe never thermalizes. Therefore, the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system continuously imprint information about temperature in the state of the probe. This allows the sequential measurement scheme to reach precision beyond the accuracy achievable by complex energy measurements on equilibrium probes.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, we calculated the spin susceptibility, Knight shift, and spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_{1}T$) of the single-component molecular conductor [Ni(dmdt)$_2$] using the random phase approximation in a multi-orbital Hubbard model describing the Dirac nodal line electronic system in this compound. This Hubbard model is composed of three fragment orbitals and on-site repulsive interactions obtained using ab initio many-body perturbation theory calculations. We found fragment-orbital-dependent spin fluctuations with the momentum $\textbf{q}$=$\textbf{0}$ and an incommensurate value of the wavenumber $\textbf{q}$=$\textbf{Q}$ at which a diagonal element of the spin susceptibility is maximum. The $\textbf{q}$=$\textbf{0}$ and $\textbf{Q}$ responses become dominant at low and high temperatures, respectively, with the Fermi-pocket energy scale as the boundary. We show that $1/T_{1}T$ decreases with decreasing temperature but starts to increase at low temperature owing to the $\textbf{q}$=$\textbf{0}$ spin fluctuations, while the Knight shift keeps monotonically decreasing. These properties are due to the intra-molecular antiferromagnetic fluctuations caused by the characteristic wave functions of this Dirac nodal line system, which is described by an $n$-band ($n\geq 3$) model. We show that the fragment orbitals play important roles in the magnetic properties of [Ni(dmdt)$_2$].</description>

      <title>Higgs Condensates are Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: I. Discrete Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Where in the landscape of many-body phases of matter do we place the Higgs condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries, interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.</description>

      <title>Classical spin models of the windmill lattice and their relevance for PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate classical Heisenberg models on the distorted windmill lattice and discuss their applicability to the spin-$1/2$ spin liquid candidate PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$. We first consider a general Heisenberg model on this lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions $J_n$ ($n=1,2,3,4$) up to fourth neighbors. Setting $J_1=J_2$ (as approximately realized in PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$) we map out the classical ground state phase diagram in the remaining parameter space and identify a competition between $J_3$ and $J_4$ that opens up interesting magnetic scenarios. Particularly, these couplings tune the ground states from coplanar commensurate or non-coplanar incommensurate magnetically ordered states to highly degenerate ground state manifolds with subextensive or extensive degeneracies. In the latter case, we uncover an unusual classical spin liquid defined on a lattice of corner sharing octahedra. We then focus on the particular set of interaction parameters $J_n$ that has previously been proposed for PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ and investigate the system's incommensurate magnetic ground state order and finite temperature multistage ordering mechanism. We perform extensive finite temperature simulations of the system's dynamical spin structure factor and compare it with published neutron scattering data for PbCuTe$_2$O$_6$ at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that thermal fluctuations in the classical model can largely explain the signal distribution in the measured spin structure factor but we also identify distinct differences. Our investigations make use of a variety of different analytical and numerical approaches for classical spin systems, such as Luttinger-Tisza, classical Monte Carlo, iterative minimization, and molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

Abstract: The characterization of ground states among all quantum states is an important problem in quantum many-body physics. For example, the celebrated entanglement area law for gapped Hamiltonians has allowed for efficient simulation of 1d and some 2d quantum systems using matrix product states. Among ground states, some types, such as cat states (like the GHZ state) or topologically ordered states, can only appear alongside their degenerate partners, as is understood from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we introduce a new class of simple states, including the $W$ state, that can only occur as a ground state alongside an exactly degenerate partner, even in gapless or disordered models. We show that these states are never an element of a stable gapped ground state manifold, which may provide a new method to discard a wide range of 'unstable' entanglement area law states in the numerical search of gapped phases. On the other hand when these degenerate states are the ground states of gapless systems they possess an excitation spectrum with $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size splitting. One familiar situation where this special kind of gaplessness occurs is at a Lifshitz transition due to a zero mode; a potential quantum state signature of such a critical point. We explore pathological parent Hamiltonians, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions, other related states, and implications for understanding thermodynamic limits of many-body quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets feature vanishing net magnetization, like antiferromagnets, but exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking and momentum-dependent spin-split band structures. Motivated by the prevalence of altermagnetic materials with non-symmorphic symmetry-dictated band degeneracies, we provide realistic minimal models for altermagnetism by constructing tight-binding models for nonsymmorphic space groups with a sublattice defined by two magnetic atoms. These models can be applied to monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, rhombohedral, hexagonal, and cubic materials and can describe d-wave, g-wave, and i-wave altermagnetism. By examining the altermagnetic susceptibility and mean field instabilities within a Hubbard model we reveal that these models have altermagnetic ground states and yield a Berry curvature that is linear in the spin-orbit coupling. We apply our models to RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, FeSb$_2$, $\kappa$-Cl, CrSb, and MnTe.</description>

      <title>Site Symmetry and Multiorbital Flat Bands on Kagome and Pyrochlore Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands in electronic band structures are intriguing platforms for strong correlation and topological physics, primarily due to the suppressed kinetic energy of electrons. Various methods have been developed to create flat bands, utilizing lattice geometry or finely tuned parameters. Despite this, the investigation of orbital symmetry in multiorbital materials is a relatively new area of focus. In this work, we propose a site symmetry based systematic approach to emerging multiorbital flat bands in lattices made of corner-connecting motifs such as the kagome and pyrochlore lattices. As a conceptual advance, the one-orbital flat bands are shown to originate as mutual eigenstates of isolated molecular motifs. Further developing the mutual eigenstate method for multiorbitals transforming differently under the site symmetries such as mirror and inversion, we derive multiorbital flat bands from the skew-symmetric interorbital Hamiltonian and introduce an isolated molecule enabled group-theoretic description of the flat band wavefunctions. Realizations of the multiorbital flatbands in relevant materials are shown to be possible under the Slater-Koster formalism. Our findings provide new directions for exploring flatband electronic structures for novel correlated and topological quantum states.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Picture of Quantum Dynamics</title>

Abstract: Although local Hamiltonians exhibit local time dynamics, this locality is not explicit in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture in the sense that the wavefunction amplitudes do not obey a local equation of motion. We show that geometric locality can be achieved explicitly in the equations of motion by "gauging" the global unitary invariance of quantum mechanics into a local gauge invariance. That is, expectation values $\langle \psi|A|\psi \rangle$ are invariant under a global unitary transformation acting on the wavefunction $|\psi\rangle \to U |\psi\rangle$ and operators $A \to U A U^\dagger$, and we show that it is possible to gauge this global invariance into a local gauge invariance. To do this, we replace the wavefunction with a collection of local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$, one for each patch of space $J$. The collection of spatial patches is chosen to cover the space; e.g. we could choose the patches to be single qubits or nearest-neighbor sites on a lattice. Local wavefunctions associated with neighboring pairs of spatial patches $I$ and $J$ are related to each other by dynamical unitary transformations $U_{IJ}$. The local wavefunctions are local in the sense that their dynamics are local. That is, the equations of motion for the local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$ and connections $U_{IJ}$ are explicitly local in space and only depend on nearby Hamiltonian terms. (The local wavefunctions are many-body wavefunctions and have the same Hilbert space dimension as the usual wavefunction.) We call this picture of quantum dynamics the gauge picture since it exhibits a local gauge invariance. The local dynamics of a single spatial patch is related to the interaction picture, where the interaction Hamiltonian consists of only nearby Hamiltonian terms. We can also generalize the explicit locality to include locality in local charge and energy densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the path-integral of conformal field theories in $D$ dimensions (CFT$_D$) can be constructed by solving for eigenstates of an RG operator following from the Turaev-Viro formulation of a topological field theory in $D+1$ dimensions (TQFT$_{D+1}$), explicitly realising the holographic sandwich relation between a symmetric theory and a TQFT. Generically, exact eigenstates corresponding to symmetric-TQFT$_D$ follow from Frobenius algebra in the TQFT$_{D+1}$. For $D=2$, we constructed eigenstates that produce 2D rational CFT path-integral exactly, which, curiously connects a continuous field theoretic path-integral with the Turaev-Viro state sum. We also devise and illustrate numerical methods for $D=2,3$ to search for CFT$_D$ as phase transition points between symmetric TQFT$_D$. Finally since the RG operator is in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor network, we compute ``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with the AdS/CFT dictionary at $D=2$. Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Gap and magnetic engineering via doping and pressure in tuning the colossal magnetoresistance in (Mn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$)$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ keeps the records of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and angular magnetoresistance (AMR). Here we report tuning the electronic transport properties via doping and pressure in (Mn$_{1-x}$Mg$_x$)$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. As the substitution of nonmagnetic Mg$^{2+}$ for magnetic Mn$^{2+}$, ferrimagnetic transition temperature $T_C$ gradually decreases, while the resistivity increases significantly. At the same time, the CMR and AMR are both enhanced for the low-doping compositions (e.g., $x = 0.1$ and 0.2), which can be attributed to doping-induced broadening of the band gap and a larger variation range of the resistivity when undergoing a metal-insulator transition by applying a magnetic field along the $c$ axis. On the contrary, $T_C$ rises with increasing pressure due to the enhancement of the magnetic exchange interactions until a structural transition occurs at $\sim$13 GPa. Meanwhile, the activation gap is lowered under pressure and the magnetoresistance is decreased dramatically above 6 GPa where the gap is closed. At 20 and 26 GPa, evidences for a superconducting transition at $\sim$5 K are observed. The results reveal that doping and pressure are effective methods to tune the activation gap, and correspondingly, the CMR and AMR in nodal-line semiconductors, providing an approach to investigate the magnetoresistance materials for novel spintronic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At very low density, the electrons in a uniform electron gas spontaneously break symmetry and form a crystalline lattice called a Wigner crystal. But which type of crystal will the electrons form? We report a numerical study of the density profiles of fragments of Wigner crystals from first principles. To simulate Wigner fragments we use Clifford periodic boundary conditions and a renormalized distance in the Coulomb potential. Moreover, we show that high-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock theory becomes exact in the low-density limit. We are thus able to accurately capture the localisation in two-dimensional Wigner fragments with many electrons. No assumptions about the positions where the electrons will localise are made. The density profiles we obtain emerge naturally when we minimise the total energy of the system. We clearly observe the emergence of the hexagonal crystal structure which has been predicted to be ground-state structure of the two-dimensional Wigner crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opening of an energy gap in the electronic structure generally indicates the presence of interactions. In materials with low carrier density and short screening length, long-range Coulomb interaction favors the spontaneous formation of electron-hole pairs, so-called excitons, opening an excitonic gap at the Fermi level. Excitonic materials host unique phenomenons associated with pair excitations. However, there is still no generally recognized single-crystal material with excitonic order, which is, therefore, awaited in condensed matter physics. Here, we show that excitonic states may exist in the quasi-one-dimensional material Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$, which has an almost ideal Dirac-like band structure, with Dirac point located exactly at Fermi level. We find that an energy gap appears at 350 K, and it grows with decreasing temperature. The spontaneous gap opening is absent in a similar material Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$. Intriguingly, the gap is destroyed by the potassium deposition on the crystal, likely due to extra-doped carriers. Furthermore, we observe a pair of in-gap flat bands, which is an analog of the impurity states in a superconducting gap. All these observations can be properly explained by an excitonic order, providing Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a new and promising candidate realizing excitonic states.</description>

      <title>Theory of the spectral function of Fermi polarons at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11805v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of Fermi polarons at nonzero temperature, including particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea shake-up to arbitrarily high orders. The exact set of equations of the spectral function is derived by using both Chevy ansatz and diagrammatic approach, and their equivalence is clarified to hold in free space only, with an unregularized infinitesimal interaction strength. The correction to the polaron spectral function arising from two-particle-hole excitations is explicitly examined, for an exemplary case of Fermi polarons in one-dimensional optical lattices. We find quantitative improvements at low temperatures with the inclusion of two-particle-hole excitations, in both polaron energies and decay rates. Our exact theory of Fermi polarons with arbitrary orders of particle-hole excitations might be used to better understand the intriguing polaron dynamical responses in two or three dimensions, whether in free space or within lattices.</description>
