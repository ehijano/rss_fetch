      <title>Phonon-Induced Exchange Gate Infidelities in Semiconducting Si-SiGe Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-spin exchange interactions between semiconductor spin qubits allow for fast single and two-qubit gates. During exchange, coupling of the qubits to a surrounding phonon bath may cause errors in the resulting gate. Here, the fidelities of exchange operations with semiconductor double quantum dot spin qubits in a Si-SiGe heterostructure coupled to a finite temperature phonon bath are considered. By employing a master equation approach, the isolated effect of each spin-phonon coupling term may be resolved, as well as leakage errors of encoded qubit operations. As the temperature is increased, a crossover is observed from where the primary source of error is due to a phonon induced perturbation of the two electron spin states, to one where the phonon induced coupling to an excited orbital state becomes the dominant error. Additionally, it is shown that a simple trade-off in pulse shape and length can improve robustness to spin-phonon induced errors during gate operations by up to an order of magnitude. Our results suggest that for elevated temperatures within 200-300 mK, exchange gate operations are not currently limited by bulk phonons. This is consistent with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Charge transport in a junction with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin -- negative shot noise at zero-bias voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anisotropic molecular magnets can be employed to manipulate charge transport in molecular nanojunctions. The charge transport through an electronic level connected to source and drain contacts and exchange-coupled with a precessing anisotropic molecular spin in an external magnetic field is studied here. Both the magnetic field and the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy parameter of the molecular spin control the total precession frequency. The Keldysh nonequilibrium Green's functions method is used to derive expressions for charge current and current noise. The precessing molecular magnetization drives inelastic tunnelling processes between electronic quasienergy levels. The dc-bias voltages allow to unveil the quasienergy levels, Larmor frequency and the anisotropy parameter, through characteristics of charge-transport measurements involving steps and peak-dip features. Under zero-bias voltage conditions, negative correlations of opposite-spin currents lead to negative shot noise for a sufficiently large anisotropy parameter that enables the change of the precession direction with respect to Larmor precession. Furthermore, it is possible to adjust the magnetic anisotropy parameter to suppress the precession frequency, leading to the suppression of shot noise. The results show that in the given setup, the charge current and shot noise can be controlled by the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the molecular magnet.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoelectric Electro-Optic Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a generalized constitutive relation describing the current response to external electromagnetic fields in electrically biased quantum materials. While our semiclassical Boltzmann approach reveals the existence of electro-optic effects induced by the Berry curvature dipole of Bloch electrons, we also find a wealth of alternative electro-optic effects originating from the interplay between Berry curvature and magnetic moment. In particular, our symmetry analysis indicates the existence of a magnetoelectric electro-optic effect, derived from the simultaneous presence of Berry curvature and magnetic moment, that requires either time-reversal or inversion symmetry breaking. The revealed conductivity coefficients are explicitly written and we derive the tensor shape describing such alternative electromagnetic responses for chiral materials pertaining to space groups 152 and 198.</description>

      <title>Theory of Magnetoresistance due to Edge Orbital Moment Accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital Hall effect, resulting from non-trivial quantum geometry of 2D materials, causes the accumulation of orbital magnetic moment near the system edges. This accumulation contributes to an electric current that flows parallel to the edges, causing a slight decrease in resistance. The accumulation of orbital moment and the resulting change in resistance can be modulated by an in-plane magnetic field. In this work, we investigate this effect in multilayered 2D materials where electrons can move between layers providing a handle through which the resistance can be controlled. The orbital moment dynamics differs from conventional spin dynamics, being governed by an anisotropic effective inverse mass tensor, for which we provide a microscopic expression. We derive phenomenological equations that describe both generation and control of orbital moment accumulations.</description>

      <title>Analytic approach to quantum metric and optical conductivity in Dirac models with parabolic mass in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the quantum geometric tensor is the Berry curvature, while the real part is the quantum metric. Dirac fermions derived from a tight-binding model naturally contains a mass term $m(k)$ with parabolic dispersion, $m(k)=$ $m+uk^{2}$. However, in the Chern insulator based on Dirac fermions, only the sign of the mass $m$ is relevant. Recently, it is reported that the quantum metric is observable by means of the optical conductivity, which is significantly affected by the parabolic coefficient. We analytically obtain the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Dirac Hamiltonian in arbitrary dimensions, where the Dirac mass has parabolic dispersion. We also study the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and the Haldane model. We find that the optical conductivity has a significant dependence on $u$ in the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, while it is not the case in the Haldane model. We also analytically study the quantum metric and the optical conductivity in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of topological invariants through temporal adiabatic evolution of bulk states in the synthetic Brillouin zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematically, topological invariants arise from the parallel transport of eigenstates on the energy bands, which, in physics, correspond to the adiabatic dynamical evolution of transient states. It determines the presence of boundary states, while lacking direct measurements. Here, we develop time-varying programmable coupling circuits between acoustic cavities to mimic the Hamiltonians in the Brillouin zone, with which excitation and adiabatic evolution of bulk states are realized in a unit cell. By extracting the Berry phases of the bulk band, topological invariants, including the Zak phase for the SSH model and the Chern number for the AAH model, are obtained convincingly. The bulk state evolution also provides insight into the topological charges of our newly developed non-Abelian models, which are also verified by observing the adiabatic eigenframe rotation. Our work not only provides a general recipe for telling various topological invariants but also sheds light on transient acoustic wave manipulations.</description>

      <title>From perfect to imperfect poor man's Majoranas in minimal Kitaev chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poor man's Majoranas (PMMs) hold the promise to engineer Majorana bound states in a highly tunable setup consisting of a chain of quantum dots that are connected via superconductors. Due to recent progress in controlling the amplitudes of elastic cotunneling (ECT) and crossed Andreev reflection (CAR), two vital ingredients for PMMs, experimental investigations of PMMs have gained significant interest. Previously, analytic conditions for the "sweet spots" that result in PMMs have focused on systems with infinite Zeeman energy. Here, we derive analytically a sweet spot condition for PMMs in a system with finite Zeeman energy in the absence of Coulomb interaction. We then consider two numerical models, one in which ECT and CAR are transmitted via superconducting bulk states and one in which they are transmitted via an Andreev bound state. In both models we find numerically near zero-energy states that are highly localized, even in the presence of finite Coulomb interaction. These states can be related to the analytic sweet spot derived in this work. However, we also find that in these more realistic models such states do not perfectly satisfy the characteristics of PMMs, rather they exist only within a "region of threshold" where PMM characteristics are approximately achieved.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Berry phase under the tunneling barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, a quantum wavepacket may acquire a geometrical phase as it evolves along a cyclic trajectory in parameter space. In condensed matter systems, the Berry phase plays a crucial role in fundamental phenomena such as the Hall effect, orbital magnetism, and polarization. Resolving the quantum nature of these processes commonly requires sensitive quantum techniques, as tunneling, being the dominant mechanism in STM microscopy and tunneling transport devices. In this study, we integrate these two phenomena - geometrical phases and tunneling - and observe a complex-valued Berry phase via strong field light matter interactions in condensed matter systems. By manipulating the tunneling barrier, with attoseconds precision, we measure the imaginary Berry phase accumulated as the electron tunnels during a fraction of the optical cycle. Our work opens new theoretical and experimental directions in geometrical phases physics and their realization in condensed matter systems, expanding solid state strong field light metrology to study topological quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Charge state estimation in quantum dots using a Bayesian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of single-electron charges in solid-state nanodevices is a key technique in semiconductor quantum bit readout for quantum information processing and probing electronic properties of nanostructures. This detection is achieved using quantum dot charge sensors, with its speed enhanced by high-speed RF reflectometry. Recently, real-time processing of data from RF reflectometry has attracted much attention to quantum information processing. In this paper, we propose a sequential method based on Bayes' theorem for estimating the charge state and compare its performance with the averaging approach and threshold judgment. When the noise variance differs between the empty and occupied states, the Bayesian approach demonstrates a lower error score, facilitating the extraction of more data points in real-time charge state estimation. Additionally, the Bayesian approach outperforms the averaging method and threshold judgment in terms of error rates for charge state estimation, even during charge transitions. This technique is broadly applicable to single-electron detection and holds substantial utility for quantum bit readout and the operation of nanoprobes that utilize single-electron detection.</description>

      <title>Microwave driven singlet-triplet qubits enabled by site-dependent g-tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hole spin qubits are rapidly emerging as the workhorse of semiconducting quantum processors because of their large spin-orbit interaction, enabling fast all-electric operations at low power. However, spin-orbit interaction also causes non-uniformities in devices, resulting in locally varying qubit energies and site-dependent anisotropies. While these anisotropies can be used to drive single-spins, if not properly harnessed, they can hinder the path toward large-scale quantum processors. Here, we report on a qubit in planar germanium, where we control the anisotropy of two spins in a double quantum dot. By characterising microwave-driven singlet-triplet qubits, we show two distinct operating regimes depending on the magnetic field direction. For in-plane fields, the two spins are largely anisotropic, enabling to measure all the available transitions; coherence times exceeding 3 $\mu$s are extracted. For out-of-plane fields, they have an isotropic response but preserve the substantial energy difference required to address the singlet-triplet qubit. Even in this field direction, where the qubit lifetime is strongly affected by nuclear spins, we find 400 ns coherence times. Our work adds a valuable tool to investigate and harness the anisotropy of spin qubits and can be implemented in any large-scale NxN device, facilitating the path towards scalable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Robustness of electron charge shuttling: Architectures, pulses, charge defects and noise thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semiconductor-based quantum technologies, the capability to shuttle charges between components is profoundly enabling. We numerically simulated various "conveyor-belt" shuttling scenarios for simple Si/SiO2 devices, explicitly modelling the electron's wave function using grid-based split-operator methods and a time-dependent 2D potential (obtained from a Poisson solver). This allowed us to fully characterise the electron loss probability and excitation fraction. Remarkably, with as few as three independent electrodes the process can remain near-perfectly adiabatic even in the presence of pulse imperfection, nearby charge defects, and Johnson-Nyquist noise. Only a substantial density of charge defects, or defects at 'adversarial' locations, can catastrophically disrupt the charge shuttling. While we do not explicitly model the spin or valley degrees of freedom, our results from this charge propagation study support the conclusion that conveyor-belt shuttling is an excellent candidate for providing connectivity in semiconductor quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian entanglement dip from scaling-induced exceptional criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well established that the entanglement entropy of a critical system generally scales logarithmically with system size. Yet, in this work, we report a new class of non-Hermitian critical transitions that exhibit dramatic divergent dips in their entanglement entropy scaling, strongly violating conventional logarithmic behavior. Dubbed scaling-induced exceptional criticality (SIEC), it transcends existing non-Hermitian mechanisms such as exceptional bound states and non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)-induced gap closures, which are nevertheless still governed by logarithmic entanglement scaling. Key to SIEC is its strongly scale-dependent spectrum, where eigenbands exhibit an exceptional crossing only at a particular system size. As such, the critical behavior is dominated by how the generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) sweeps through the exceptional crossing with increasing system size, and not just by the gap closure per se. We provide a general approach for constructing SIEC systems based on the non-local competition between heterogeneous NHSE pumping directions, and show how a scale-dependent GBZ can be analytically derived to excellent accuracy. Beyond 1D free fermions, SIEC is expected to occur more prevalently in higher-dimensional or even interacting systems, where antagonistic NHSE channels generically proliferate. SIEC-induced entanglement dips generalize straightforwardly to kinks in other entanglement measures such as Renyi entropy, and serve as spectacular demonstrations of how algebraic and geometric singularities in complex band structures manifest in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity effect and scale-dependent viscosity in atomic quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been predicted that two-dimensional electron gases possess an anomalous ``tomographic'' transport regime outside of the traditional collisionless and hydrodynamic limits, but an experimental confirmation has been elusive so far. This anomalous regime is marked by the appearance of an odd-even effect in the quasiparticle lifetimes where deformations of the Fermi surface with odd-parity become long-lived in comparison to even-parity ones. In this work, we establish neutral atomic quantum gases as an alternative platform to reveal this new transport regime and demonstrate an odd-even effect in the normal phase of two-component Fermi gases. By diagonalizing the Fermi liquid collision integral, we identify odd-parity modes with anomalously long lifetimes below temperatures $T\leq 0.1 T_F$, which is within the reach of current cold atom experiments. In a marked difference from condensed matter setups, we show that the odd-even effect in neutral gases is widely tunable with interactions along the BCS-BEC crossover and suppressed on the BEC side where the Fermi surface is destroyed. We propose the damping rate of quadrupole oscillations as an experimental signature of the long-lived odd-parity modes. The damping rate is set by the shear viscosity, which for finite trap confinement is dominated by odd-parity modes and thus anomalous enhanced compared to the hydrodynamic limit. Furthermore, a full computation of the shear viscosity within Fermi liquid theory shows that the magnitude of the odd-even effect depends on the particle number and is particularly pronounced in mesoscopic Fermi gases. Our findings suggest that the hydrodynamic behavior of neutral degenerate quantum gases is much richer than previously thought and should include additional long-lived modes.</description>

      <title>Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</description>

      <title>Improved Electrical Conductivity of Copper and Nitrogen Functionalized Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the electrical conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with a particular focus on the effects of doping. Using a first-principles approach, we study the electronic structure, phonon dispersion, and electron-phonon scattering to understand the finite-temperature electrical transport properties in CNTs. Our study covers both prototypical metallic and semiconducting CNTs, with special emphasis on the influence of typical defects such as vacancies and the incorporation of copper or nitrogen, such as pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N, and oxidized N. Our theoretical study shows significant improvements in the electrical conduction properties of copper-CNT composites, especially when semiconducting CNTs are functionalized with nitrogen. Doping is found to cause significant changes in the electronic density of states near the Fermi level, which affects the electrical conductivity. Calculations show that certain types of functional groups, such as N-pyrrolic, result in a ~30-fold increase in the conductivity of semiconducting CNTs compared to Cu-incorporated CNTs alone. For metallic CNTs, the conductivity is in agreement with existing experimental data, and our prediction of significant increases in conductivity with N-pyrrolic functional group is consistent with recent experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness of doping in modifying conductivity. Our study provides valuable insight into the electronic properties of doped CNTs and contributes to the development of ultra-high conductivity CNT composites.</description>

      <title>Strain-modulated Intercalated Phases of Pb Monolayer with Dual Periodicity in SiC(0001)-Graphene Interface</title>

Abstract: Intercalation of metal atoms at the SiC(0001)-graphene (Gr) interface can provide confined 2D metal layers with interesting properties. The intercalated Pb monolayer (ML) has shown the coexistence of the Gr(10x10)-moire and a stripe phase, which still lacks understanding. Using density functional theory calculation and thermal annealing with ab initio molecular dynamics, we have studied the formation energy of SiC(0001)/Pb/Gr for different coverages of intercalated Pb. Near the coverage of a Pb(111)-like ML mimicking the (10x10)-moire, we find a slightly more stable stripe structure, where one half of the structure has compressive strain with Pb occupying the Si-top sites and the other half has tensile strain with Pb off the Si-top sites. This stripe structure along the Gr zigzag direction has a periodicity of 2.3 nm across the [1-210] direction agreeing with the previous observations using scanning tunneling microscopy. Analysis with electron density difference and density of states show the tensile region has a more metallic character than the compressive region, while both are dominated by the charge transfer from the Pb ML to SiC(0001). The small energy difference between the stripe and Pb(111)-like structures means the two phases are almost degenerate and can coexist, which explains the experimental observations.</description>

Abstract: The typical material bismuth shows a several-fold change in electrical resistivity at 4 K over a 400 {\AA} film thickness period. In 2021, we discovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 {\AA} on strongly correlated compound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to an increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion. However, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray diffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 {\AA} periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic correlation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott insulators depending on the film thickness. We refer to the remarkable size effect stemming from strong electron correlation as the 'Mott size effect'.</description>

      <title>Stretch-induced tunability of electrical transport properties of three-dimensional graphene-based foam structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fast electron transport and superior multidirectional flexibility of three-dimensional graphene-based foams (GFs) are pivotal in the realm of stretchable electronics. We observed pre-stretching induced modulation of the temperature-dependent electrical resistivity of GFs, where, as the pre-stretch strain level increased, the distinct temperature dependence of the resistivity of a GF sample would change and might even exhibit a notable transition from negative dependence to positive dependence. We attempted to interpret the phenomenon by proposing a new conduction network model that represents GF structures as interconnected graphene islands and island/island conduction junctions and incorporates three conduction mechanisms: thermally activated conduction, phonon-limited conduction, and fluctuation-induced tunneling conduction. By fitting-assisted analysis, we found that the temperature dependence of the resistivity of a GF sample primarily relies on the discrete quantities of graphene islands and island/island conduction junctions, and the resistivity originating from each conduction mechanism. As pre-stretch strain level increases, these factors would change due to conduction network alteration, local strain-induced phonon hardening, and local strain-induced transport gap modulation, all resulting from pre-stretching. Our results offer valuable insights into the optimization of GFs-based stretchable electronic devices, such as performance enhancement through structural modifications.</description>

      <title>Long-range optomechanical interactions in SiN membrane arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical systems using a membrane-in-the-middle configuration can exhibit a long-range type of interaction similar to how atoms show collective motion in an optical potential. Photons bounce back and forth inside a high-finesse Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity and mediate the interaction between multiple membranes over a significant distance compared to the wavelength. Recently, it has been demonstrated that light coupling the center-of-mass mode of the membranes can cause coherent mechanical noise cancellation. Long-range interactions involving the breathing mode of the membranes have to date not been experimentally demonstrated, however. In our experiment, a double-membrane system inside a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity resonantly enhances the cavity field, resulting in a stronger optomechanical coupling strength from the increased radiation pressure. The resonance condition is first identified by analyzing the slope of the dispersion relation. Then, the optomechanical coupling is determined at various chip positions over one wavelength range. The optimum coupling conditions are obtained and enhancement is demonstrated for double membrane arrays with three different reflectivites, reaching nearly four-fold enhancement for the breathing mode of $R=65\%$ double membranes. The cavity losses at the optimum coupling are also characterized and the potential of reaching the single-photon strong coupling regime is discussed.</description>

      <title>Superadiabatic Landau-Zener transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition dynamics of two-state systems with time-dependent energy levels, first considered by Landau, Zener, Majorana, and St\"uckelberg, is one of the basic models in quantum physics and has been used to describe various physical systems. We propose here a generalization of the Landau-Zener (LZ) problem characterized by distinct paths of the instantaneous eigenstates as the system evolves in time, while keeping the instantaneous eigenenergies exactly as in the standard LZ model. We show that these paths play an essential role in the transition probability $P$ between the two states, and can lead to superadiabatic transitions, i.e., to a substantial reduction of $P$. As an instructive extreme case, we identify an unconditionally adiabatic regime with $P=0$ no matter how fast the system evolves in time and regardless of the energy gap between the two levels at the anticrossing point. On the other hand, large $P$ occur even in the absence of any anticrossing point. These phenomena can be explained by observing the rotation of the instantaneous eigenvectors on the Bloch sphere. The superadiabatic LZ model can describe valley transition dynamics during charge and spin shuttling in semiconductor quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Density Functional Theory for Strain-Dependent Magnetic Properties of MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with Diffusion Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the predictive power of density functional theory (DFT) for the magnetic properties of MnBi\(_2\)Te\(_4\) (MBT), an intrinsically magnetic topological insulator with potential applications in spintronics and quantum computing. Our theoretical understanding of MBT has been challenged by discrepancies between experimental results and \textit{ab initio} calculations, particularly with respect to its electronic and magnetic properties. Our results show that the magnetic phase diagram of MBT varies significantly depending on the Hubbard $U$ parameter in the DFT framework, highlighting the importance of benchmark calculations. To address these challenges, we establish an optimized Hubbard $U$ approach derived from Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) calculations, which directly solves the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation based on the stochastic process, and implement it in the DFT framework. Once the optimized $U$ value is determined as a function of strain, we apply it to achieve DMC-level accuracy within our DFT framework. This approach is instrumental in accurately describing the magnetic states of MBT and understanding the underlying mechanisms governing its magnetic properties and their dependence on external factors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Switch and Spatial Lattice Solitons of Photonic s-p Orbitals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop fs laser-fabricated asymmetric couplers and zig-zag arrays consisting of single and two-mode waveguides with bipartite nonlinearity. The fundamental mode ($s$ orbital) is near resonance with the neighboring higher-order $p$ orbital, causing efficient light transfer at low power. Due to Kerr nonlinearity, the coupler works as an all-optical switch between $s$ and $p$ orbitals. Single- and double-peak spatial solitons of $s$-$p$ orbitals form in the lattice due to the bipartite nature of the on-site nonlinearity. We probe highly localized bulk and edge solitons, peaked at the $s$ and $p$ orbitals, spectrally residing in the photonic band gap. Our work will be important for exploring inter-orbital couplings and nonlinear interactions in intricate photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Low-lying magnon frequency comb in skymion crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stable, low-power and tunable magnon frequency comb (MFC) is crucial for magnon-based precision measurements, quantum information processing and chip integration. Original method for creating MFC utilizes the nonlinear interactions between propagating spin waves and localized oscillations of an isolated magnetic texture, e.g., skyrmion. It requires a driving frequency well above the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and the spectrum frequency of MFC will quickly approach to the detection limit of conventional microwave technique after only tens of comb teeth. In addition, the detection and manipulation of a single skyrmion is challenging in experiments due to its high degree of locality. These issues hinder the applications of MFC. In this work, we report the low-lying MFC with comb frequencies below the FMR in a skyrmion crystal (SkX). We show that the MFC originates from the three-wave mixing between the collective skyrmion gyration and breathing in the SkX. Our findings significantly improve the efficiency of the nonlinear frequency conversion from a single-frequency mircowave input, and establish a synergistic relationship between the SkX and MFC, which paves the way to coherent information processing and ultra-sensitive metrology based on MFC.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Assisted Tunneling through Quantum Dot Systems Connected to Majorana Bound States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze phonon-assisted tunneling transport in a quantum dot side connected to a Majorana bound state in a topological superconducting nanowire. We investigate the behavior of the current through the dot, for a range of experimentally relevant parameters, in the presence of one long-wave optical phonon mode. We consider the current-gate voltage, the current-bias voltage and the current-dot-Majorana coupling characteristics under the influence of the electron-phonon coupling. In the absence of electron-phonon interaction, the Majorana bound states suppress the current when the gate voltage matches the Fermi level, but the increase in the bias voltage counteracts this effect. In the presence of electron-phonon coupling, the current behaves similarly as a function of the renormalized gate voltage. As an added feature at large bias voltages, it presents a dip or a plateau, depending on the size of the dot-Majorana coupling. Lastly, we show that the currents are most sensitive to, and depend non-trivially on the parameters of the Majorana circuit element, in the regime of low temperatures combined with low voltages. Our results provide insights into the complex physics of quantum dot devices used to probe Majorana bound states.</description>

      <title>Flat Bands in Three-dimensional Lattice Models with Non-trivial Hopf Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the presence of exactly and nearly flat bands with non-trivial topology in three-dimensional (3D) lattice models. We first show that an exactly flat band can be realized in a 3D lattice model characterized by a 3D topological invariant, namely Hopf invariant. In contrast, we find another distinct 3D model, exhibiting both 2D Chern and 3D Hopf invariant, namely Hopf-Chern insulator, that can host nearly or perfect flat bands across different 2D planes. Such a Hopf-Chern model can be constructed by introducing specific hopping along the orthogonal direction of a simple two-orbital 2D Chern insulator in the presence of in-plane nearest-neighbor and next-nearest hopping among different orbitals. While the Chern planes host nearly perfect flat bands, the orthogonal planes can host both perfect or nearly perfect flat bands with zero Chern number at some special parameter values. Interestingly, such a 3D lattice construction from 2D allows finite Hopf invariant too. Finally, we show that higher Chern models can also be constructed in the same lattice setup with only nearest and next-nearest hopping, but the appearance of flat bands along high-symmetric path in the Brillouin zone requires longer-range hopping. We close with a discussion on possible experimental platforms to realize the models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl fermions are hypothetical chiral particles that can also manifest as excitations near three-dimensional band crossing points in lattice systems. These quasiparticles are subject to the Nielsen-Ninomiya "no-go" theorem when placed on a lattice, requiring the total chirality across the Brillouin zone to vanish. This constraint results from the topology of the (orientable) manifold on which they exist. Here, we ask to what extent the concepts of topology and chirality of Weyl points remain well-defined when the underlying manifold is non-orientable. We show that the usual notion of chirality becomes ambiguous in this setting, allowing for systems with a non-zero total chirality. This circumvention of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem stems from a generic discontinuity of the vector field whose zeros are Weyl points. Furthermore, we discover that Weyl points on non-orientable manifolds carry an additional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant which satisfies a different no-go theorem. We implement such Weyl points by imposing a non-symmorphic symmetry in the momentum space of lattice models. Finally, we experimentally realize all aspects of their phenomenology in a photonic platform with synthetic momenta. Our work highlights the subtle but crucial interplay between the topology of quasiparticles and of their underlying manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scalability of spin qubit devices is conditioned by qubit-to-qubit variability. Disorder in the host materials indeed affects the wave functions of the confined carriers, which leads to variations in their charge and spin properties. Charge disorder in the amorphous oxides is particularly detrimental owing to its long-range influence. Here we analyze the effects of charge traps at the semiconductor/oxide interface, which are generally believed to play a dominant role in variability. We consider multiple random distributions of these interface traps and numerically calculate their impact on the chemical potentials, detuning and tunnel coupling of two adjacent quantum dots in SiGe heterostructure. Our results highlight the beneficial screening effect of the metal gates. The surface of the heterostructure shall, therefore, be covered as much as possible by the gates in order to limit variability. We propose an alternative layout with tip-shaped gates that maximizes the coverage of the semiconductor/oxide interface and outperforms the usual planar layout in some regimes. This highlights the importance of design in the management of device-to-device variability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising for optoelectronic applications due to their strongly bound excitons. While bright excitons have been thoroughly scrutinized, dark excitons are much less investigated as they are not observable with far-field spectroscopy. However, with their non-zero momenta, dark excitons are significant for applications requiring long-range transport or coupling to external fields. We access such dark excitons in WS2 monolayer using transient photoemission electron microscopy with sub-diffraction limited spatial resolution (75 nm) and exceptionally high temporal resolution (13 fs). Image time series of TMD flakes are recorded at several different fluences. We directly observe the ultrafast formation of dark K-Q excitons in monolayer WS2 occurring within 14-50 fs and follow their subsequent picosecond decay. We distinguish exciton dynamics between the interior and edges of the monolayer TMD and conclude that the long-term evolution of dark excitations is defect-mediated while intervalley scattering is not affected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the seminal works in the fifties it has been known that a bath of non-interacting electrons mediates an interaction between local moments (such as nuclear spins or magnetic impurities) coupled to distant sites of the lattice. Recent efforts in simultaneous control of multi-qubit arrays rely on defining quantum dots in environments which likewise contain electrons capable of mediating effective interactions. It is therefore interesting to analyze systems with more than two impurities in higher orders of perturbation theory. Here we derive and discuss the significance of the effective spin interactions between four impurities in fourth order of the coupling between the impurities and the substrate, mediated by conduction electrons of a two-dimensional square lattice. This effective interaction resembles the ring exchange -- a coupling of four spins appearing in perturbative treatment of the Hubbard model. Despite it being a higher-order effect, it can dramatically influence the magnetic ordering. We show that as an effective interaction between impurity spins, the ring exchange can also compete with the more familiar two-spin interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Triple-Q density waves are often realized in many materials such as charge density waves in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) and spin density waves, such as Skyrmion crystal, in B20 compounds. Compared with the single-Q density waves, triple-Q density waves have an internal degree of freedom (phase shift) made from the phase of the order parameters in addition to the translations of density waves. Although this phase shift has been studied in Ginzburg-Landau theory or in spin Hamiltonian, its impact on the electronic states has not yet been explored from the microscopic point of view. Here, we systematically investigate the interference of different Q density waves revealing its pivotal effects depending on the phase shift. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in affecting the interference effects of triple-Q density waves on electronic states. Due to such interference, the band geometry in the momentum space becomes nontrivial, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that the nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Microwave-optical spectroscopy of Rydberg excitons in the ultrastrong driving regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ultrastrong driving of Rydberg excitons in Cu$_2$O by a microwave field. The effect of the field is studied using optical absorption spectroscopy, and through the observation of sidebands on the transmitted laser light. A model based on Floquet theory is constructed to study the system beyond the rotating wave approximation. We obtain near quantitative agreement between theory and experiment across a 16-fold range of microwave field strengths spanning from the perturbative to the ultrastrong driving regime. Compared to Rydberg atoms, the large non-radiative widths of Rydberg excitons leads to new behaviour such as the emergence of an absorption continuum without ionization.</description>

      <title>Excitons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exciton is a Coulomb-driven bound state, which normally consists of an electron and a hole. Under the influence of charge fractionalization, an exotic construction of excitons arises from pairing between fractional particle and hole charge. Despite numerous theoretical considerations, experimental realization of fractional excitons remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report hallmark transport signatures of excitonic pairing that coexist with fractional quantum Hall effect states. By investigating the composition of interlayer excitons and their role in the construction of the underlying wavefunction, we describe two types of never-before-seen fractional quantum Hall effect orders. One can be viewed as the fractional analogue of the exciton condensate at total filling of one. The other involves a different type of exciton, which obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Automation of Quantum Dot Measurement Analysis via Explainable Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13699v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum dot (QD) devices for quantum computing has necessitated more efficient and automated methods for device characterization and tuning. Many of the measurements acquired during the tuning process come in the form of images that need to be properly analyzed to guide the subsequent tuning steps. By design, features present in such images capture certain behaviors or states of the measured QD devices. When considered carefully, such features can aid the control and calibration of QD devices. An important example of such images are so-called \textit{triangle plots}, which visually represent current flow and reveal characteristics important for QD device calibration. While image-based classification tools, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to verify whether a given measurement is \textit{good} and thus warrants the initiation of the next phase of tuning, they do not provide any insights into how the device should be adjusted in the case of \textit{bad} images. This is because CNNs sacrifice prediction and model intelligibility for high accuracy. To ameliorate this trade-off, a recent study introduced an image vectorization approach that relies on the Gabor wavelet transform [1]. Here we propose an alternative vectorization method that involves mathematical modeling of synthetic triangles to mimic the experimental data. Using explainable boosting machines, we show that this new method offers superior explainability of model prediction without sacrificing accuracy. This work demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of applying explainable machine learning techniques to the analysis of quantum dot measurements, paving the way for further advances in automated and transparent QD device tuning.</description>

      <title>Optimality and Noise-Resilience of Critical Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15559v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare critical quantum sensing to passive quantum strategies to perform frequency estimation, in the case of single-mode quadratic Hamiltonians. We show that, while in the unitary case both strategies achieve precision scaling quadratic with the number of photons, in the presence of dissipation this is true only for critical strategies. We also establish that working at the exceptional point or beyond threshold provides sub-optimal performance. This critical enhancement is due to the emergence of a transient regime in the open critical dynamics, and is invariant to temperature changes. When considering both time and system size as resources, for both strategies the precision scales linearly with the product of the total time and the number of photons, in accordance with fundamental bounds. However, we show that critical protocols outperform optimal passive strategies if preparation and measurement times are not negligible. Our results are applicable to a broad variety of critical sensors whose phenomenology can be reduced to that of a single-mode quadratic Hamiltonian, including systems described by finite-component and fully-connected models.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <title>Theory of nonlinear terahertz susceptibility in ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytical theory is developed for predicting the nonlinear susceptibility of ionic polarization to continuous electromagnetic waves in both bulk and strained thin film ferroelectrics. Using a perturbation method for solving the nonlinear equation of motion for ionic polarization within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, the full second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor is derived as a function of frequency, temperature, and strain. The theory predicts the coexistence of a significantly enhanced second-order dielectric susceptibility and a relatively low dielectric loss in BaTiO3 films with a strain-stabilized monoclinic ferroelectric phase and in a strained SrTiO3 film near its temperature-driven second-order ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. This work establishes a theoretical framework for predicting and exploiting nonlinear interactions between THz waves and ferroelectric materials, and more generally, suggests exciting opportunities to strain-engineer nonlinear dynamical properties of ferroelectrics beyond the static and quasi-static limits.</description>

      <title>Edge states in all-dielectric square-lattice arrays of bianisotropic microwave resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a bianisotropic response associated with a broken mirror symmetry of a dielectric resonator allows opening the bandgap in simple square lattice arrays of such resonators. Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we characterize the dispersion of edge states, examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience towards various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. The considered design opens novel possibilities in constructing optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>Relevance of Anisotropy in the Kondo Effect -- Lessons From the Symplectic Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Kondo model with symplectic symmetry was recently put forward as the effective low-energy theory of a superconducting-island device coupled to multiple leads. This model, which possesses non-Fermi liquid physics and effective anyons, was argued to belong to the class of topological Kondo effects. Here, we clarify the extent of stability of its exotic fixed point using perturbative and numerical renormalization group in conjunction with bosonization and conformal field theory. In contrast to previous claims, we show that asymmetry in the coupling to the leads destabilizes the non-Fermi liquid. Other destabilizing perturbations include asymmetry in the superconducting pairing or internal energy of the individual quantum dots in the island. Nevertheless, these perturbations all generate the same relevant operators. Thus, only a small number of couplings need to be tuned individually, and these can be selected according to experimental convenience. Our results highlight a common misconception that anisotropy in the Kondo coupling is always irrelevant. As demonstrated, relevant terms will emerge whenever the group generators do not span the full space of impurity operators. This calls for a more detailed inspection of models that exhibit this property, such as large-spin impurities and SO(M) Kondo models</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: Enhanced Laser Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular, single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state engineering, and quantum measurement and control.</description>

      <title>Something from Nothing: A Theoretical Framework for Enhancing or Enabling Cooling of a Mechanical Resonator via the anti-Stokes or Stokes Interaction and Zero-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to describe how zero-photon detection may be utilized to enhance laser cooling via the anti-Stokes interaction and, somewhat surprisingly, enable cooling via the Stokes interaction commonly associated with heating. Our description includes both pulsed and continuous measurements as well as optical detection efficiency and open-system dynamics. For both cases, we discuss how the cooling depends on the system parameters such as detection efficiency and optomechanical cooperativity, and we study the continuous-measurement-induced dynamics, contrasting to single-photon detection events. For the Stokes case, we explore the interplay between cooling and heating via optomechanical parametric amplification, and we find the efficiency required to cool a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection. This work serves as a companion article to the recent experiment [E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, K. D. Major, et al., arXiv:2408.01734 (2024)], which demonstrated enhanced laser cooling of a mechanical oscillator via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes signal. The framework developed here provides new approaches for cooling mechanical resonators that can be applied to a wide range of areas including nonclassical state preparation, quantum thermodynamics, and avoiding the often unwanted heating effects of parametric amplification.</description>
