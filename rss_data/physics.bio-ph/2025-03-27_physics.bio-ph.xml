      <title>Coherent Turning Behaviors Revealed Across Adherent Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adherent cells have long been known to display two modes during migration: a faster mode that is persistent in direction and a slower one where they turn. Compared to the persistent mode, the turns are less studied. Here we develop a simple yet effective protocol to isolate the turns quantitatively. With the protocol, we study different adherent cells in different morphological states and find that, during turns, the cells behave as rotors with constant turning rates but random turning directions. To perform tactic motion, the cells bias the sign of turning towards the stimuli. Our results clarify the bimodal kinematics of adherent cell migration. Compared to the rotational-diffusion-based turning dynamics - which has been widely implemented, our data reveal a distinct picture, where turns are governed by a deterministic angular velocity.</description>

      <title>From reductionism to realism: Holistic mathematical modelling for complex biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At its core, the physics paradigm adopts a reductionist approach to modelling, aiming to understand fundamental phenomena by decomposing them into simpler, elementary processes. While this strategy has been tremendously successful in physics and is typically considered the pinnacle of scientific formulation, it has often fallen short in addressing fundamental questions in the biological sciences. This limitation arises from the inherent complexity of biological systems, characterised by heterogeneity, poly-functionality and interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the traditional framework of complex systems modelling also falls short, as its emphasis on broad theoretical principles has often failed to produce realistic, predictive, empirically grounded insights. To advance towards the goal of actionable mathematical models in biology, we argue here, using neuroscience as a case study, that it is necessary to move beyond simple reductionist approaches and instead embrace the intrinsic complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems-leveraging the growing availability of high-resolution data and recent advances in high-performance computing. In particular, we advocate for a holistic mathematical modelling paradigm that harnesses rich representational structures such as annotated and multilayer networks, employs agent-based models and simulation-based approaches, and focuses on the inverse problem of inferring system properties from dynamical observations. Finally, we emphasise that this approach is fully compatible with the search for fundamental principles in biophysics, and we highlight the substantial potential it holds to drive progress in mathematical biology over the next two decades.</description>

      <title>Self-construction and destruction of living transport networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological transport networks adapt through dynamic interactions between material transport and structural modification during growth and development. In this work, we present a model of transport network growth driven by local material concentration. Using an advection-diffusion framework on a metric graph with a tip growth rule, we investigate how successive construction and destruction influence network development. Our results reveal that while repeated cycles of elongation and retraction can facilitate growth enhancement, a network need to have a structure that mitigates material dissipation. This finding suggests that additional regulatory mechanisms are necessary for networks to efficiently redistribute resources following structural retraction.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle Collision Dynamics Simulations of the Flagellar Apparatus in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the swimming dynamics, orientational behavior, and hydrodynamic interactions of the flagellar apparatus (FA) of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD) simulations. Extending the model established in Yang et al., we simulate the FA as a chain of monomers connected by elastic springs. Our simulations reveal that an FA with a nonzero mean curvature in its flagellar beat pattern exhibits sustained ballistic motion for several hundred beats before crossing over to a diffusion-dominated regime due to rotational diffusion. In contrast, $FA_0$, a flagellar apparatus consisting of two flagella with zero average curvature positioned head-to-head, fails to achieve net propulsion due to its mirror-symmetric deformations, confirming that non-reciprocal shape deformation is necessary but not sufficient condition for propulsion. The orientational auto-correlation function (OACF) of FA decays exponentially, aligning with that of an inactive FA, while the OACF of $FA_0$ also follows an exponential decay, similar to an inactive $FA_0$. These findings indicate that active beating does not influence the rotational diffusion of the flagellar apparatus. Additionally, simulations of an asymmetric FA, where the arms beat at different frequencies, corroborate experimental observations, revealing a helical swimming trajectory. When two FAs swim along the same axis in close proximity, they form stable pairs, leading to enhanced swimming speeds. Conversely, head-on encounters result in mutual blocking, preventing any net displacement. These findings provide valuable insights into the collective behavior of microswimmers and their hydrodynamic interactions in low Reynolds number environments.</description>

      <title>Evolution of robust cell differentiation mechanisms under epigenetic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-cellular organisms, cells differentiate into multiple types as they divide. States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be robust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic landscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding with final cell types. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution? To address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression dynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By evolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major differentiation mechanisms exhibiting different properties regarding their variance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these mechanisms, type A, exhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until reaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing process where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the stable landscape of the cells towards varying final cell states. Lastly, type C exhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into pre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through periodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well with Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B demonstrate a novel method through dimensional reduction of gene-expression states during differentiation. Correspondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through differentiation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Load-dependent resistive-force theory for helical filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive rotation of rigid helical filaments is the propulsion strategy used by flagellated bacteria and some artificial microswimmers to navigate at low Reynolds numbers. In a classical 1976 paper, Lighthill calculated the `optimal' resistance coefficients in a local (logarithmically accurate) resistive-force theory that best approximates predictions from the nonlocal (algebraically accurate) slender-body theory for force-free swimming of a rotating helix without an attached load (e.g., no cell body). These coefficients have since been widely applied, often beyond the conditions for which they were originally derived. Here, we revisit the problem for the case where a load is attached to the rotating filament, such as the cell body of a bacterium or the head of an artificial swimmer. We show that the optimal resistance coefficients depend in fact on the size of the load, and we quantify the increasing inaccuracy of Lighthill's coefficients as the load grows. Finally, we provide a physical explanation for the origin of this unexpected load-dependence.</description>

      <title>Structured Random Binding: a minimal model of protein-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe Structured Random Binding (SRB), a minimal model of protein-protein interactions rooted in the statistical physics of disordered systems. In this model, nonspecific binding is a generic consequence of the interaction between random proteins, exhibiting a phase transition from a high temperature state where nonspecific complexes are transient and lack well-defined interaction interfaces, to a low temperature state where the complex structure is frozen and a definite interaction interface is present. Numerically, weakly-bound nonspecific complexes can evolve into tightly-bound, highly specific complexes, but only if the structural correlation length along the peptide backbone is short; moreover, evolved tightly-bound homodimers favor the same interface structure that is predominant in real protein homodimers.</description>

      <title>Structure-Based Experimental Datasets for Benchmarking Protein Simulation Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review article provides an overview of structurally oriented experimental datasets that can be used to benchmark protein force fields, focusing on data generated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and room temperature (RT) protein crystallography. We discuss what the observables are, what they tell us about structure and dynamics, what makes them useful for assessing force field accuracy, and how they can be connected to molecular dynamics simulations carried out using the force field one wishes to benchmark. We also touch on statistical issues that arise when comparing simulations with experiment. We hope this article will be particularly useful to computational researchers and trainees who develop, benchmark, or use protein force fields for molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.</description>

      <title>Seasonal footprints on ecological time series and jumps in dynamic states of protein configurations from a non-linear forecasting method characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13811v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have analyzed phenology data and protein configurations from molecular dynamics simulations with the nonlinear forecasting method proposed by May and Sugihara. Our primary focus in this work is to characterize the dynamic state of a system by quantifying prediction quality from data. Full plots of prediction quality as a function of dimensionality $E$ and forecasting time $T_p$, the two basic parameters of the method, give fast and valuable information about Complex Systems dynamics. We detect changes in protein dynamics due to mutations and, regarding ecology data, we show how cycles and {\it rhythms} of the environment manifests in parameter space $(E,T_p)$ for some species.</description>

      <title>Dynamic optical coherence tomography algorithm for label-free assessment of swiftness and occupancy of intratissue moving scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>
