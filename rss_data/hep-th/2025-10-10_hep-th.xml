      <title>Correlation Function/Wilson Loop Duality in Gauge Theory from EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we initiate a systematic study of the $n$-point correlation functions (CF) in gauge theories in the sequential light-cone (SLC) limit. Focusing on QCD, we formulate a factorization theorem for the CF of four vector currents in this limit using tools from soft-collinear effective field theory (SCET). This result unveils a duality between CF and Wilson loops in non-conformal field theories, according to which the singular structure of the CF is described by a null polygonal Wilson loop dressed by universal jet functions and current form factors, directly related to well-known ingredients in collider physics. We employ this new factorization theorem to obtain the singular terms of the four-point CF in QCD in the SLC limit up to three loops. This constitutes the first determination of terms beyond one loop and in particular determines, for the first time, conformal-symmetry-breaking terms induced by the non-vanishing $\beta$-function of QCD. As a stringent check, we verify that our result satisfies the anomalous conformal Ward identities and its leading-transcendental term reproduces the known correlation function in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM to three loops. Our results are easily generalized to the multi-point case, offering a powerful tool for future applications of SCET to the study of the fundamental structure of gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Localized states of BFSS super quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recently discovered localized and non-uniform phases of the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix quantum mechanics. Building on [1], we provide first-principles derivations of their properties and extend the results with new analytic and numerical insights. We show that strongly coupled BFSS dynamics emerge from a specific Carrollian transformation of 11-dimensional supergravity, which we justify in detail. In this framework, the uniform BFSS phase corresponds to a black string in a $pp$-wave background. We demonstrate that this background is unstable to a Gregory-Laflamme instability and, for the first time, compute the associated growth rate. The instability gives rise to non-uniform and localized phases that dominate the microcanonical ensemble in certain low-energy regimes, with the localized phase also prevailing in the canonical ensemble at low temperatures. We identify the corresponding first- and second-order phase transitions and derive analytic formulas for the thermodynamics of the localized phase, accurate to better than $0.3\%$ against numerical results.</description>

      <title>Spinning Mellin amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a definition of Mellin amplitudes for conformal correlators involving arbitrary spinning operators in tensor representations of the Lorentz group. These representations cover all bosonic local operators. Our strategy is to perform discrete Mellin transforms on all scalar products involving polarization vectors, so that each polarization vector can be interpreted as the position of a fictitious scalar operator. We establish the general pole structures and factorization properties of these spinning Mellin amplitudes. We also provide a systematic algorithm to derive factorization formulas with arbitrary spinning exchanges, yielding new explicit results up to spin-4. To illustrate the practicality of our formalism, we bootstrap the 3- and 4-point current correlators in a 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory, which are dual to gluon scattering amplitudes in $\mathrm{AdS}_5 \times \mathrm{S}^3$. The results agree with the snowflake channel of 6- and 8-point scalar supergluon amplitudes in the literature.</description>

      <title>Heterotic Footprints in Classical Gravity: PM dynamics from On-Shell soft amplitudes at one loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical scattering of charged black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory. Working in the classical (Post-Minkowskian) regime, we extract the conservative two-body potential by expanding the one loop amplitudes in the soft regime. We show explicitly that, as in GR, the relevant soft amplitudes are infrared (IR) finite once the long-range interactions are consistently treated via Lippmann-Schwinger equation and the associated IR subtraction. The scattering angle is then obtained from the eikonal exponentiation of the soft amplitude. Our results track the separate roles of electromagnetic and dilatonic charges in both the conservative dynamics and the eikonal phase, and they reduce smoothly to the GR limit when the charges and dilaton coupling are switched off. Where applicable, we compare with existing results in the literature and find agreement. These findings provide amplitude-based benchmarks for compact-object dynamics in EMD and furnish building blocks for waveform modeling in beyond-GR scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the consistent disformal couplings to fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disformal couplings to fermions lead to a unique derivative coupling to the axial fermionic current, which contains higher derivatives in general. We derive general conditions on consistent disformal couplings by requiring the absence of higher time derivatives, as they typically lead to ghost degrees of freedom. For a two-scalar field disformal transformation, we show that the consistent disformal coupling must have a degenerate field space metric. This allows us to explore consistent, new two-scalar field modified gravity models. We show that the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action leads to two-field Horndeski or two-field DHOST theories. Our formalism also applies to disformal transformations with higher derivatives. We derive the consistent subclasses of disformal transformations that include second derivatives of a scalar field and first derivatives of a vector field that lead to generalized U-DHOST and degenerate beyond generalized Proca theories.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Spectral Edge in SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work on Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity has shown that, at low temperatures, the annealed entropy becomes negative and departs from the quenched entropy. From the perspective of the random-matrix theory (RMT) dual of JT gravity, this effect is encoded in the level spacing statistics of the spectral edge that is universally described by the Airy model. At low temperature, the quenched entropy exhibits a power law dependence determined by the symmetry class of the RMT ensemble. Here we study the same question in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model which possesses much more structure than RMT. Through numerical simulations, we find that the level spacing statistics of the SYK model match the relevant RMT ensembles even near the spectral edge, thus leading to an agreement with the RMT prediction for the quenched entropy at low temperatures. We also show similar effects in supersymmetric wormholes filled with matter, which is modeled by the $\mathcal N = 2$ supersymmetric SYK model. Numerically extracting the spectral edge properties of the BPS operators allows us to compute the quenched entanglement entropy of the wormhole in the large particle number limit.</description>

      <title>The Rise of Linear Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider constraints on the low-energy spectrum of amplitudes with higher-spin exchange. Assuming unitarity, crossing symmetry, and super-convergent high energy behavior, reminiscent of the scattering of spin-1 and spin-2 massless helicity states, we demonstrate that the spectrum that maximizes the leading higher spin couplings of the second and third resonances is consistently given by a linear trajectory. Furthermore, for gravitational theories, the optimal spectrum is the linear trajectory defined by the mass and spin of the graviton and the lightest spin-4 resonance.</description>

      <title>CPT breaking in noncommutative Magueijo-Smolin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review an instance of noncommutative geometry based on a specific realization of the model of doubly special relativity proposed by Magueijo and Smolin (MS) on noncommutative spacetime. In particular, we discuss the Hopf algebra associated to it, which has not been considered in the literature till now. We show that the momentum sector of this model can be viewed as a particular basis of the \kp model. An interesting property is that the MS Hamiltonian is not invariant under the reversal of the sign of the energy, and in particular it is not invariant under the standard definition of charge conjugation. Therefore, if following Dirac one identifies the negative energy states with antiparticles, their mass differs from that of particles. We examine the possible consequences of this fact in the context of first quantization and discuss its interpretation from the point of view of quantum field theory, taking into account possible alternative definitions of charge conjugation proposed in the noncommutative framework.</description>

      <title>Holographic solutions from 5D $SO(2)\times ISO(3)$ $N=4$ gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various types of holographic solutions from five-dimensional $N=4$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with $SO(2)\times ISO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity can be obtained from the maximal gauged supergravity in seven dimensions on a Riemann surface. For a negatively curved Rimann surface $H^2$, the resulting five-dimensional gauged supergravity admits a supersymmetric $N=4$ $AdS_5$ critical point. This $AdS_5$ vacuum is dual to an $N=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT) arising from M5-branes wrapped on $H^2$. We study holographic RG flow solutions describing deformations of this SCFT by turning on relevant, marginal and irrelevant operators to $N=2$ non-conformal phases in the IR. Solutions describing conformal interfaces between these non-conformal phases and singular boundaries are also given. We finally study a number of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black string and black hole solutions holographically dual to RG flows across dimensions from the $N=2$ SCFT to two-dimensional SCFTs and superconformal quantum mechanics in the IR. All of the solutions can be uplifted to M-theory by a consistent truncation on $H^2\times S^4$.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Bulk-to-Defect via Ward Identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conformal field theory, the presence of a defect partially breaks the global symmetry, giving rise to defect operators such as the tilts. In this work, we derive integral identities that relate correlation functions involving bulk and defect operators -- including tilts -- to lower-point bulk-defect correlators, based on a detailed analysis of the Lie algebra of the symmetry group before and after the defect-induced symmetry breaking. As explicit examples, we illustrate these identities for the 1/2 BPS Maldacena-Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM and for magnetic lines in the $O(N)$ model in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. We demonstrate that these identities provide a powerful tool both to check existing perturbative correlators and to impose nontrivial constraints on the CFT data.</description>

      <title>Tripartite entanglement in the HaPPY code is not holographic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic states satisfy several entropic inequalities owing to the Ryu-Takayangi formula. A drawback of these inequalities is that they only use bipartite entanglement in their formulation. We investigate a recently proposed "GHZ-forbidding" inequality, built out of the reflected entropy and the tripartite multi-entropy, that holds for holographic states. We show that the inequality is either violated or saturated, but never strictly satisfied, by stabilizer states, thereby showing that stabilizer states are not holographic. As a consequence, we show that tripartite entanglement in the HaPPY code is not holographic.</description>

      <title>Axion Quality Problem: Keep Calm and Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion models generically suffer from a severe quality problem when coupled to gravity. In this article we provide a very simple model with a high quality axion. The axion is a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson of the baryon number symmetry, $U(1)_B$, of a new composite sector that breaks $U(1)_B$ spontaneously when it confines. A controlled example is a supersymmetric QCD (SQCD) with $N_c = N_f$. The axion shift symmetry is automatically protected due to the high dimension of the gauge-invariant baryon operator, with the Peccei-Quinn breaking operators arising at dimension $N_c+2$. The standard model gauge group is embedded as a subgroup of the flavor symmetry group of SQCD that has an anomaly with $U(1)_B$, generating the standard coupling with gluons.</description>

      <title>Emergent spacetime supersymmetry at 2D fractionalized quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While experimental evidence for spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) in particle physics remains elusive, condensed matter systems offer a promising arena for its emergence at quantum critical points (QCPs). Although there have been a variety of proposals for emergent SUSY at symmetry-breaking QCPs, the emergence of SUSY at fractionalized QCPs remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate emergent space-time SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in the Kitaev honeycomb model with Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) spin-phonon coupling. Specifically, through numerical computations and analytical analysis, we show that the anisotropic SSH-Kitaev model hosts a fractionalized QCP between a Dirac spin liquid and an incommensurate/commensurate valence-bond-solid phase coexisting with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. A low-energy field theory incorporating phonon quantum fluctuations reveals that this fractionalized QCP features an emergent $\mathcal{N}=2$ spacetime SUSY. We further discuss their universal experimental signatures in thermal transport and viscosity, highlighting the concrete lattice realization of emergent SUSY at a fractionalized QCP in 2D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State merging is a fundamental protocol in quantum information theory that generalizes quantum teleportation. Traditionally, it is achieved by local operations on shared entanglement and classical communication. In this work, we study state merging done with alpha-bits, a versatile quantum communication resource weaker than qubits. We study alpha-bit state merging with and without catalytic entanglement, and we find a potential gap between the rates of alpha-bits consumed. In light of our result, we discuss how to interpret entanglement wedge reconstruction in AdS/CFT in terms of alpha-bit state merging</description>

      <title>Weakly turbulent saturation of the nonlinear scalar ergoregion instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform time-domain evolutions of the ergoregion instability on a horizonless spinning ultracompact spacetime in scalar theories with potential-type and derivative self-interactions mimicking the nonlinear structure of the Einstein equations. We find that the instability saturates by triggering a weakly turbulent direct cascade, which transfers energy from the most unstable and large-scale modes to small scales. The cascade's nonlinear timescales of each mode are orders of magnitude shorter than the corresponding linear e-folding times. Through this mechanism, the counter-rotating stable light ring is filled with a spectrum of higher-order azimuthal modes forming a ring-like shape. Thereby we demonstrate that turbulent processes are likely also important during the fully gravitational saturation of the instability, leaving imprints in the gravitational wave emission.</description>

      <title>Ergoregion instability in bosonic stars: scalar mode structure, universality, and weakly nonlinear effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracompact spinning horizonless spacetimes with ergoregions are subject to the ergoregion instability. We systematically investigate the instability of a massless scalar field in a variety of rapidly spinning Proca stars and boson stars using WKB-, frequency-, and time-domain methods. We find universal features in the mode structure: the onset of the instability is signaled by a zero-mode, the mode frequencies and growth rates are related by a simple scaling relation in the small-frequency limit (as found for Kerr-like objects), the mode frequencies approach the orbital frequency of counter-rotating stably trapped null geodesics in the eikonal limit, and for each unstable azimuthal mode only a finite number of overtones and polar modes are exponentially growing. The e-folding times are as short as $\tau\sim 10^4 M$ (in terms of the spacetime's ADM mass $M$). Interestingly, we find a near universal relationship between the frequencies and growth rates across all bosonic stars and also compared with Kerr-like objects. Furthermore, we show that weakly nonlinear backreaction of the instability induces a shift in growth rates as well as emission of gravitational waves; we find evidence that these effects lead to an amplification of the unstable process. This suggests that strongly nonlinear interactions are important during the gravitational saturation of the instability.</description>

      <title>Quantizing Bosonized Fermi Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.</description>

Degenerate minima of a curvature-minimizing potential correspond to Euclidean, Lorentzian or mixed phases of geometry.

      <title>Effects of magnetic fields on spinning test particles orbiting Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the kinematic effects of spinning test particles orbiting the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black hole. Employing with the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations, we explore the dynamics of precessing orbits and distinct orbital types, including circular orbits and innermost stable circular orbits. Our results reveal the substantial impact of the magnetic field on the trajectories of spinning particles, particularly in regions characterized by significant radial distances. More importantly, our study shows that an augmented magnetic field necessitates an increased orbital angular momentum to uphold spinning particles within their characteristic orbits at equivalent radial distances. Our result contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the spinning celestial object motion around black holes endowed with magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>The large-$N$ limit of the topological susceptibility of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang-Mills theories via Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a large-$N$ determination of the topological susceptibility $\chi$ of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Yang--Mills theories using non-perturbative numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory for $3\le N \le 6$, and adopting the Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions (PTBC) algorithm to bypass topological freezing for $N&gt;3$. Thanks to this algorithm I am able to explore a uniform range of lattice spacing across all values of $N$, and to precisely determine $\chi$ for finer lattice spacings compared to previous studies with periodic or open boundary conditions. By taking the continuum limit at fixed smoothing radius in physical units, I am also able to show the independence of the continuum limit of $\chi$ from this choice. I conclude providing a comprehensive comparison of my new PTBC results with previous determinations of the topological susceptibility in the literature, both at finite $N$ and in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement without Spin-Analyzing Power Dependence at the Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum entanglement at the colliders which is independent of the spin-analyzing powers. Taking $\Lambda(\to p\pi^-)\bar{\Lambda}(\to \bar{p}\pi^+)$ as an example, we investigate whether quantum entanglement in fermion pairs produced at colliders can be certified by using only angular information from final-state decays, while remaining independent of the parity-violating decay parameters $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$. Building on a general decomposition of any angular observable in terms of Wigner d-functions, we show that the expectation value must take the form $\mathcal{O}_0+\mathcal{O}_1\alpha_\Lambda+\mathcal{O}_2\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}+\mathcal{O}_3\alpha_\Lambda\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$, with coefficients $\mathcal{O}_i$ ($i=0,1,2,3$) linear in the spin-density matrix elements $\alpha_{k,j}\alpha^*_{m,n}$. We obtain the value ranges of observables over the general and separable spaces of $\alpha_{k,j}$, and demonstrate a sufficient entanglement condition for pure states, extending it to mixed states by convexity. In constructing an $\alpha_\Lambda$- and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$-independent witness from angular observables alone, we find that there are obstacles to probe quantum entanglement via the inequality-type and ratio-type ways. Finally, we present the successful constructions with additional spin information: for the process of $e^+e^-\to J/\Psi\to \Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ at $e^+ e^-$ collider, independent spin information provided by beam-axis selection enables the construction of normalized observables $f_i~(i=1,2)$ that are insensitive to $\alpha_\Lambda$ and $\alpha_{\bar{\Lambda}}$; if their measured values lie in $\left[-1,-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)\cup\left(\tfrac{1}{2},1\right]$, entanglement is certified, irrespective of purity or mixedness.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Regge-Wheeler potential: some nonperturbative results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbation theory of black holes in noncommutative spacetimes with noncommutativity of the type $[t\stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \alpha A(r)$ and $[\varphi \stackrel{\star}{,} r] = i a \beta A(r)$ for arbitrary $A(r)$, which includes several Moyal-type spaces and also the $\kappa$-Minkowski space. The main result of this paper is an analytical expression for the effective potential of the axial perturbation modes, valid to all orders in the noncommutativity parameter. This is achieved by evaluating the $\star$-products using translations in the radial direction, i.e., Bopp shift. We comment on various regimes, such as Planck-scale black holes, where the noncommutativity length scale is of the same order of magnitude as the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of pure $R^2$ gravity: full Hamiltonian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a full Hamiltonian constraint analysis of pure Ricci-scalar-squared ($R^2$) gravity to clarify recent controversies regarding its particle spectrum. While it is well established that the full theory consistently propagates three degrees of freedom, we confirm that its linearised spectrum around Minkowski spacetime is empty. moreover, we show that this is not a feature unique to Minkowski spacetime, but a generic property of all traceless-Ricci spacetimes that have a vanishing Ricci scalar, such as the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole spacetimes. The mechanism for this phenomenon is a change in the nature of the constraints upon linearisation: ten second-class constraints of the full theory become first-class, while the three momentum constraints degenerate into a single constraint. Furthermore, we show that higher order perturbation theory around these singular backgrounds reveals no degrees of freedom at any order. This is in conflict with the general analysis and points to the fact that such backgrounds are surfaces of strong coupling in field space, where the dynamics of perturbations becomes nonperturbative. We further show via a cosmological phase-space analysis that the evolving universe is able to penetrate through the singular $R=0$ surface.</description>

      <title>Probing departures from $\Lambda$CDM by late-time datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational data play a pivotal role in identifying cosmological models that are both theoretically consistent and empirically viable. In this work, we investigate whether the standard $\Lambda$CDM model exhibits significant departure with current late time datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI DR2, and various Type Ia supernova compilations (Pantheon$^+$, DES-SN5Y, Union3). We analyze several dynamical dark energy models, including $\omega$CDM, o$\omega$CDM, $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE. While CC + DESI DR2 data show mild deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($\lesssim 2\sigma$), adding supernova samples (DES-SN5Y or Union3) increases deviations, with BA, JBP, and Logarithmic models reaching $3-3.5\sigma$, and CC + DESI DR2 + DES-SN5Y producing the largest deviations. We find consistent evidence for $\omega_0 &gt; -1$ and $\omega_a &lt; 0$ in all dark energy models, indicating that the cosmological constant faces a potential crisis and that dynamical dark energy models could provide a possible solution, characterized by a Quintom-B type scenario. The $\Lambda$CDM model has long served as the cornerstone of modern cosmology, successfully shaping our understanding of the Universe from its earliest epochs to the present day. However, in light of DESI DR2 and other recent measurements, emerging cracks in this paradigm suggest that a complete understanding of the cosmos may require moving beyond the cosmological constant and exploring new physics governing the dark sector.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a family of 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ superconformal field theories that have zero-dimensional Coulomb and Higgs branches and propose that the rational vertex operator algebras $W^{\text{min}}_{k - \scriptstyle{\frac{1}{2}}}(\mathfrak{sp}_{2N})$ and $L_{k}(\mathfrak{osp}_{1|2N})$ model the modular tensor categories of line operators in their topological $A$ and $B$ twists, respectively. Our analysis indicates that the action of 3d mirror symmetry on this family of theories is related to a novel level-rank duality and leads to several conjectural $q$-series identities of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Unitarity, Causality, and Solar System Bounds May Significantly Limit the Use of Gravitational Waves to Test General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12118v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prospect of detecting/constraining deviations from general relativity by studying gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes has been one of the primary motivations of GW interferometers like LIGO/Virgo. Within pure gravity, the only possible way deviations can arise is from the existence of higher order derivative corrections, namely higher powers of the Riemann curvature tensor, in the effective action. Any observational bounds imply constraints on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. At the level of the action, one can imagine the coefficients are sufficiently large so as to be in principle detectable. However, from the point of view of some fundamental principles, namely causality and unitarity, this is much less clear, as we examine here. We begin by reviewing certain known bounds on these coefficients, which together imply a low cut off on the effective theory. We then consider a possible mechanism to generate such terms, namely in the form of many scalars, minimally coupled to only gravity, that can be integrated out to give these higher order operators. We show that a by product of this is the generation of quantum corrections to Newton's potential, whose observable consequences are already ruled out by solar system tests. We point out that over 7 orders of magnitude of improvement in interferometer sensitivity would be required to avoid such solar system constraints. We also mention further constraints from Hawking radiation from black holes.</description>

Abstract: Formulating a quantum theory of gravity lies at the heart of fundamental theoretical physics. This collection of lecture notes encompasses a selection of topics that were covered in six mini-courses at the Nordita PhD school "Towards Quantum Gravity". The scope was to provide a coherent picture, from its foundation to forefront research, emphasizing connections between different areas. The lectures begin with perturbative quantum gravity and effective field theory. Subsequently, two ultraviolet-complete approaches are presented: asymptotically safe gravity and string theory. Finally, elements of quantum effects in black hole spacetimes are discussed.</description>

Abstract: To deepen our understanding of Quantum Gravity and its connections with black holes and cosmology, building a common language and exchanging ideas across different approaches is crucial. The Nordita Program "Quantum Gravity: from gravitational effective field theories to ultraviolet complete approaches" created a platform for extensive discussions, aimed at pinpointing both common grounds and sources of disagreements, with the hope of generating ideas and driving progress in the field. This contribution summarizes the twelve topical discussions held during the program and collects individual thoughts of speakers and panelists on the future of the field in light of these discussions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Ryu-Takayanagi Formula for Multi-Boundary Black Holes from 2D Large-$c$ CFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12388v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of quantum states involving multiple entangled CFTs in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, associated with multi-boundary black hole geometries, and demonstrate that the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula for entanglement entropy can be derived using only boundary CFT data. Approximating the OPE coefficients by their Gaussian moments within the 2D large-$c$ CFT ensemble, we show that both the norm of the states and the entanglement entropies associated with various bipartitions--reproducing the expected bulk dual results--can be computed purely from the CFT. All $\textit{macroscopic geometric}$ structures arising from gravitational saddles emerge entirely from the universal statistical moments of the $\textit{microscopic algebraic}$ CFT data, revealing a statistical-mechanical mechanism underlying semiclassical gravity. We establish a precise correspondence between the CFT norm, the Liouville partition function with ZZ boundary conditions, and the exact gravitational path integral over 3D multi-boundary black hole geometries. For entanglement entropy, each RT phase arises from a distinct leading-order Gaussian contraction, with phase transitions--analogous to replica wormholes--emerging naturally from varying dominant statistical patterns in the CFT ensemble. Our derivation elucidates how the general mechanism behind holographic entropy, namely a boundary replica direction that elongates and becomes contractible in the bulk dual, is encoded explicitly in the statistical structure of the CFT data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a first-principle construction of baryons as quantum Hall droplets in single-flavor holographic QCD. The baryons are described as charged D6-branes with a circular boundary on a flavor D8-brane in the Type IIA backgrounds dual to the confining and non-confining phases. The holographic description allows us to calculate precisely their properties, such as mass and size. We also consider other objects with baryonic charge, such as vortons, domain walls with holes, and "sandwich vortons", and discuss the relative (meta)stability of all these configurations.</description>

      <title>DSSYK at Infinite Temperature: The Flat-Space Limit and the 't Hooft Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18054v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the limit of infinite radius de Sitter space becomes locally flat and the static patch tends to Rindler space. A holographic description of the static patch must result in a holographic description of some flat space theory, expressed in Rindler coordinates. Given such a holographic theory how does one decode the hologram and determine the bulk flat space theory, its particle spectrum, forces, and bulk quantum fields? In this paper we will answer this question for a particular case: DSSYK at infinite temperature and show that the bulk theory is a strongly coupled version of the 't Hooft model, i.e., (1+1)-dimensional QCD, with a single quark flavor. It may also be thought of as an open string theory with mesons lying on a single Regge trajectory.</description>

      <title>A partially broken Fronsdal model for massless higher-spin particles of integer spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing arbitrary parameters in the usual Fronsdal model, we find a region in the parameters space away from the ``Fronsdal point'' where we still have an irreducible description of massless particles of arbitrary integer spin $s\ge 3$. The higher spin gauge symmetry is further constrained by a vanishing double divergence condition on the traceless gauge parameter: $\partial\cdot\partial\cdot\bar\Lambda=0$. Remarkably, it does not introduce extra propagating gauge invariants. We demonstrate that we only have spin-$s$ helicity states as propagating modes for arbitrary integer $s\ge 3$. For the simplest $s=3$ case we present a gauge invariant proof while for $s\ge 4$ we use a light-cone gauge. The reduction in the gauge symmetry allows for more general source couplings when compared to the Fronsdal model.</description>

Abstract: We propose an AdS$\times$S factorization formula at the level of the generating function for correlators with arbitrary Kaluza-Klein configurations, and implement it in the supergravity limit of $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. By incorporating this mechanism into Mellin space bootstrap, together with an observed $Z_2$ symmetry under AdS$\ \leftrightarrow\ $S, we manage to simultaneously work out unified formulas both for all five-point half-BPS correlators and for all four-point correlators with one superdescendant. This AdS\times$S bootstrap method is directly applicable to generic multi-point computation at tree level.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate radiation from near-extremal black holes formed by collapse, focusing on the role of large backreaction effects arising from gravitational fluctuations in the near-horizon region. Such effects have previously been identified from computations based on JT gravity and its Schwarzian description, most notably for the Euclidean partition function. Restricting attention to the s-wave sector, we integrate out gravity by solving the constraint equations in the Hamiltonian formalism, obtaining an effective scalar action with a coupling that grows at low temperature, thus enabling a real-time treatment of quantum backreaction. We then take initial steps toward evaluating the impact of this interaction on correlations of the outgoing radiation, and compare our findings with earlier results.</description>

We find several such dualities and one Poisson--Lie triality.

Abstract: We study the dynamics of electrically charged black-hole binaries and their gravitational-wave emission during the inspiral phase. Within the post-Newtonian framework, we derive the conservative and dissipative dynamics up to second order (2PN), combining Effective Field Theory and classical methods. We compute the NNLO conservative Lagrangian, LO dissipative effects in harmonic and Lorenz gauges, and provide the equations of motion, center-of-mass transformations, and the Lagrangian/Hamiltonian in ADM-type coordinates. We also obtain gauge-invariant expressions for the binding energy, periastron advance in quasi-circular orbits, and the scattering angle in unbound orbits. Our results extend previous analyses and are fully consistent with recent post-Minkowskian findings.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT phase transitions and criticality for charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05423v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the holographic dual of the extended thermodynamics of spherically symmetric, charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. The gravitational thermodynamics of Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes can be extended by allowing for variations of the cosmological constant and Newton's constant. In the dual CFT this corresponds to including the central charge C and its chemical potential $\mu$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic variables. In addition, compared to Einstein's theory of gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity introduces higher-order curvature terms. The coupling constants of these higher-order curvature terms $\alpha$ can serve as new thermodynamic quantities, which will also be dual to thermodynamic quantities on the boundary CFT, a feature not present in the CFT dual to Einstein's gravity previously. Based on the holographic dictionary, we consider the critical behavior and phase transition phenomena of the CFT description of the charged Gauss-Bonnet black holes in $d=4$ and $d=5$ in the ensemble at fixed $(C, \mathcal{V}, \tilde{Q}, \tilde{\mathcal{A}})$. We find that the conventional description of free energy cannot adequately describe the phase transitions and critical behavior of the CFT in this ensemble. This may stem from the fact that the constraints we have adopted are different from the conventional ones.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix (TM), while the second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). We introduce some extensions of these method that provide also spins of the CFT operators, modulo an integer. With comparable computing resources, the TM and LDO methods perform equally well. The agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins is excellent up to the scaling dimesnion 4.125, and reasonably good up to 2 units higher. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical. Our results also suggest certain integrality and wall-crossing conjectures for capped vertex functions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for sub-EW-scale ALP searches via $\gamma+b\bar{b}$ signatures at the LHC using jet substructure techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data show no clear indication of new physics and only incremental improvements are anticipated at the energy frontier in the near future. However, while the focus of the LHC has been on constraining TeV scale physics, new particles could still be hiding below the electroweak scale. In order to obtain sensitivity to a new light boson with couplings to SM fermions, a potentially promising decay channel, for resonances with mass $\gtrsim {\cal O}(10)$ GeV, would be the decay to $b\bar b$ pairs. The measurement of such signatures is challenging due to the trigger requirements at the LHC. In this work, we explore the LHC sensitivity to a light pseudoscalar, or axion-like particle (ALP), in the $b\bar{b}$ final state with an associated photon, using jet substructure techniques, in the mass range between 10 GeV and 100 GeV. We obtain projected exclusions on the ALP-fermion coupling in a region of phase space which has not so far been probed by direct searches. We further discuss the impact that lower trigger thresholds may have on the LHC reach.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Cherenkov radiation can be interpreted as ghost instability of a certain type. Solutions of modified gravity theories often contain ghost instabilities. One type of such ghost instability is associated with existence of different types of species with causal cones that do not share common time, which leads to vacuum decay via creation of particles with positive and negative energies. We show that this ghost instability can be seen as Cherenkov radiation and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Topologically Charged Vortices at Superconductor-Quantum Hall Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore interface states between a type-II $s$-wave superconductor (SC) and a $\nu = 1$ quantum Hall (QH) state. We show that the effective interaction gives rise to two emergent Abelian Higgs fields, representing paired electrons localized at the SC-QH interface. These fields interact with each other in the presence of a Chern-Simons term originating from the QH sector. The Chern-Simons term leads to a topological contribution to the photon mass and imparts a \emph{fractional} topological charge of $e/2$ to the interface vortices. The topological mass modifies the vortex lattice at the interface, while the topological charge leads to formation of vortex quadruplets. We predict that these effects lead to a \emph{topological} Abrikosov lattice at the interface.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the viscous properties and the Bjorken expansion of the QGP medium at finite angular velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the viscous properties as well as the Bjorken expansion of a rotating QGP medium. In the noncentral events of heavy-ion collisions, the produced medium can carry a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity. This rotation can significantly affect various properties, including viscous properties and the expansion of the QGP medium. Using a novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation at finite angular velocity, we have calculated the shear and bulk viscosities and compared them with their counterparts in the standard relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach. Our results show that the angular velocity increases both shear and bulk viscosities, suggesting an enhanced momentum transfer within the medium and greater fluctuations in local pressure. This rotational effect on viscosities is more evident at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. Our analysis also shows that, compared to the standard relaxation time approximation, the shear viscosity is lower while the bulk viscosity is higher in the novel relaxation time approximation for all temperatures. Additionally, some observables related to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are markedly impacted due to rotation. We have also studied the hydrodynamic evolution of matter within the Bjorken boost-invariant scenario and have found that the energy density evolves faster in the presence of finite rotation than in the nonrotating case. Consequently, rapid rotation accelerates the cooling process of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Modeling Tidal Disruptions with Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) occur when stars pass close enough to supermassive black holes to be torn apart by tidal forces. Traditionally, these events are studied with computationally intensive hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we present a fast, physically motivated two-stage model for TDEs. In the first stage, we model the star's tidal deformation using linear stellar perturbation theory, treating the star as a collection of driven harmonic oscillators. When the tidal energy exceeds a fraction $\gamma$ of the star's gravitational binding energy (with $\gamma \sim \mathcal O(1)$), we transition to the second stage, where we model the disrupted material as free particles. The parameter $\gamma$ is determined with a one-time calibration to the critical impact parameter obtained in hydrodynamical simulations. This method enables fast computation of the energy distribution ${\rm d} M/{\rm d}E$ and fallback rate ${\rm d} M/{\rm d} T$, while offering physical insight into the disruption process. We apply our model to MESA-generated profiles of middle-age main-sequence stars. Our code is available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: We describe asymptotic symmetries at spatial infinity of asymptotically flat spacetimes within the context of a generalization of the Beig-Schmidt-Ashtekar-Romano-framework. We demonstrate that it is possible to relax certain smoothness requirements of the asymptotic transformations considered previously, without violating asymptotic flatness. This leads to an enhancement of the asymptotic symmetry group that includes logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity. Our results complement several recent results which confirm the existence of logarithmic supertranslations at spatial infinity in the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvement in quantum simulations of bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum simulation of bosons on digital quantum computers requires truncating the Hilbert space to finite dimensions. The method of truncation and the choice of basis states can significantly impact the complexity of the quantum circuit required to simulate the system. For example, a truncation in the Fock basis where each boson is encoded with a register of $Q$ qubits, can result in an exponentially large number of Pauli strings required to decompose the truncated Hamiltonian. This, in turn, can lead to an exponential increase in $Q$ in the complexity of the quantum circuit. For lattice quantum field theories such as Yang-Mills theory and QCD, several Hamiltonian formulations and corresponding truncations have been put forward in recent years. There is no exponential increase in $Q$ when resorting to the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, while we do not know how to remove the exponential complexity in $Q$ in the commonly used Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian. Specifically, when using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian, the continuum limit, or, in other words, the removal of the ultraviolet energy cutoff, is obtained with circuits whose resources scale like $Q$, while they scale like $\mathcal{O}(\exp(Q))$ for the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian: this can be seen as an exponential speed up in approaching the physical continuum limit for the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian formulation. We show that the universal framework, advocated by three of the authors (M.~H., S.~M., and E.~R.) and collaborators, provides a natural avenue to solve the exponential scaling of circuit complexity with $Q$, and it is the reason why using the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Axionic Black-Hole Clouds as Seeds for Graviton Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01689v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that both, standard general relativity (GR) and Chern-Simons (CS) gravity, the latter containing chiral gravitational anomaly terms, seed the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a multi-mode squeezed state. This involves the interaction of gravitons with the axionic cloud surrounding a superradiant Kerr (rotating) black hole background. The order of magnitude of the squeezing effect, specifically the number of graviton excitations in the squeezed vacuum, is estimated in the non-relativistic limit, relevant for the superradiance process. It is found analytically that the squeezing from the GR process of annihilation of two axions into two gravitons, dominates, by many orders of magnitude, that coming from the axion decay into two gravitons, induced by the higher-derivative CS term. It is also shown that significant squeezing effects are produced in the case of long-lived axionic clouds, whose lifetimes are much longer than the timescale for which superradiance is effective. A brief discussion on current exclusion (for the first time) of very-long axion-cloud lifetimes, through comparison of our results with current LIGO data, as well as potential detection of such effects in future interferometers is also given</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical modeling of SN 2025kg associated with the Fast X-ray Transient EP250108a</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) associated with X-Ray Flashes (XRFs) are extremely rare. Therefore, the discovery of each new object in this class offers a unique opportunity to improve our understanding about their origins and potential connection with other high-energy phenomena. SN 2025kg is one of the most recent events discovered in this category, and exhibits a double-peaked light curve, with an initial cooling phase followed by the main peak. Here, we investigate the possible mechanisms powering its bolometric light curve and expansion velocities, using numerical calculations to simulate the explosion. We found that low ejecta masses (Mej ~ 2 Msun) and moderate explosion energies (E ~ 2e51 erg) are required to reproduce the data. Our models also show that a large amount of nickel (M_Ni = 0.85 Msun) is needed to achieve the high luminosity of SN 2025kg, which makes this scenario difficult to sustain. As an alternative, we explore a model in which a millisecond magnetar serves as the primary energy source. A magnetar with a spin period of 3 ms, approximately, and a magnetic field of 28e14 G gives an adequate match to the data. To account for the early cooling phase, we assume the presence of a dense circumstellar material surrounding the progenitor, with a mass of 0.27 Msun and an extension of 500 Rsun. A comparison and modeling of a select group of SNe--SN 2006aj, SN 2020bvc and SN 2023pel--is also presented. A remarkable similarity emerges between SN 2025kg and SN 2023pel. As SN 2023pel was recently proposed to be powered by a magnetar, this further supports the magnetar scenario for SN 2025kg.</description>

      <title>Comparing Minimal and Non-Minimal Quintessence Models to 2025 DESI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we examine the 2025 DESI analysis of dark energy, which suggests that dark energy is evolving in time with an increasing equation of state $w$. We explore a wide range of quintessence models, described by a potential function $V(\varphi)$, including: quadratic potentials, quartic hilltops, double wells, cosine functions, Gaussians, inverse powers. We find that while some provide improvement in fitting to the data, compared to a cosmological constant, the improvement is only modest. We then consider non-minimally coupled scalars which can help fit the data by providing an effective equation of state that temporarily obeys $w&lt;-1$ and then relaxes to $w&gt;-1$. Since the scalar is very light, this leads to a fifth force and to time evolution in the effective gravitational strength, which are both tightly constrained by tests of gravity. For a very narrow range of carefully selected non-minimal couplings we are able to evade these bounds, but not for generic values.</description>

      <title>Generation of Volume-Law Entanglement by Local-Measurement-Only Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeated local measurements typically have adversarial effects on entangling unitary dynamics, as local measurements usually degrade entanglement. However, recent works on measurement-only dynamics have shown that strongly entangled states can be generated solely through non-commuting random multi-site and multi-spin projective measurements. In this work, we explore a generalized measurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that volume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet non-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model comprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where generalized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to detector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law entanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the main chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics. Remarkably, we find that such large-entanglement generation can be achieved using only the measurements of one-body operators. Moreover, we show that measurements of non-local higher-body operators can be used to control and reduce entanglement generation by introducing kinetic constraints to the dynamics. We discuss the statistics of entanglement measures along the quantum trajectories, the approach to stationary distributions of entanglement or long-time steady states, and the associated notions of limited ergodicity in the measurement-only dynamics. Our findings highlight the potential of non-random measurement protocols for controlled entanglement generation and the study of non-unitary many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Defect mediated quantum melting of charge ordered insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2d) electronic systems on a lattice at fractional filling $\nu = p/q$ exhibit a competition between charge ordered insulators, called Wigner-Mott insulators (WMIs), at large Coulomb repulsion and Fermi-liquid metals at large electronic kinetic energy. When those two energy scales are roughly equal, insulating states that restore the lattice translation symmetry, which we call quantum charge liquids (QCLs), may emerge. When gapped, these QCLs must exhibit topological order. In this work, we show that the allowed topological ordered phases that are proximate to the WMI strongly depend on the charge ordering in the WMI. In particular, we show that when $q$ is even, no direct transition exists between a WMI with the smallest allowed unit cell size from filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" WMI, and the topological order with the smallest ground state degeneracy on a torus allowed by filling constraints, i.e., the "minimal" TO. Furthermore, we describe the quantum melting transition of the WMIs to the proximate QCLs in terms of the proliferation of the topological defects of the WMIs. The field theory of this transition in terms of the topological defects reveals their role as precursors to the anyon excitations in the QCLs.</description>
