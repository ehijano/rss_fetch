      <title>On $k$-planar Graphs without Short Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of forbidding short cycles to the edge density of $k$-planar graphs; a $k$-planar graph is one that can be drawn in the plane with at most $k$ crossings per edge. Specifically, we consider three settings, according to which the forbidden substructures are $3$-cycles, $4$-cycles or both of them (i.e., girth $\ge 5$). For all three settings and all $k\in\{1,2,3\}$, we present lower and upper bounds on the maximum number of edges in any $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices. Our bounds are of the form $c\,n$, for some explicit constant $c$ that depends on $k$ and on the setting. For general $k \geq 4$ our bounds are of the form $c\sqrt{k}n$, for some explicit constant $c$. These results are obtained by leveraging different techniques, such as the discharging method, the recently introduced density formula for non-planar graphs, and new upper bounds for the crossing number of $2$-- and $3$-planar graphs in combination with corresponding lower bounds based on the Crossing Lemma.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Domineering Positions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domineering is a partizan game where two players have a collection of dominoes which they place on the grid in turn, covering up squares. One player places tiles vertically, while the other places them horizontally; the first player who cannot move loses. It has been conjectured that the highest temperature possible in Domineering is 2. We have developed a program that enables a parallel exhaustive search of Domineering positions with temperatures close to or equal to 2 to allow for analysis of such positions</description>

      <title>Degree-balanced decompositions of cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every cubic graph on $n$ vertices contains a spanning subgraph in which the number of vertices of each degree deviates from $\frac{n}{4}$ by at most $\frac{1}{2}$, up to three exceptions. This resolves the conjecture of Alon and Wei (Irregular subgraphs, Combin. Probab. Comput. 32(2) (2023), 269--283) for cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Equitable factorizations of highly edge-connected graphs: complete characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that every highly edge-connected graph $G$, under a necessary and sufficient degree condition, can be edge-decomposed into $k$ factors $G_1,\ldots, G_k$ such that for each vertex $v\in V(G_i)$ with $1\le i\le k$, $|d_{G_i}(v)-d_G(v)/k|&lt;1$. This characterization covers graphs having at least $k-1$ vertices with degree not divisible by $k$. In addition, we investigate almost equitable factorizations in arbitrary edge-connected graphs.
  Next, we establish a simpler criterion for the existence of factorizations $G_1,\ldots, G_k$ satisfying $d_{G_i}(v)\ge \lfloor d_G(v)/k\rfloor$ for all vertices $v$ (reps. $d_{G_i}(v)\le \lceil d_G(v)/k\rceil$). As an application, we come up with a criterion to determine whether a highly edge-connected graph with $\delta(G)\ge \delta_1+\cdots+ \delta_m$ (resp. $\Delta(G)\le \Delta_1+\cdots+ \Delta_m$) can be edge-decomposed into factors $G_1,\ldots, G_m$ satisfying $\delta(G_i)\ge \delta_i$ (resp. $\Delta(G_i)\le \Delta_i$) for all $i$ with $1\le i \le m$, provided that $\delta_1+\cdots+ \delta_m$ is divisible by an odd number $p$ and $\delta_i\ge p-1\ge 2$ (resp. $\Delta_1+\cdots+ \Delta_m$ is divisible by $p$ and $\Delta_i\ge p-1\ge 2$).
  For graphs of even order, we replace an odd-edge-connectivity condition. In particular, for the special case $m=2$, we refine the needed odd-edge-connectivity further by giving a sufficient odd-edge-connectivity condition for a graph $G$ to have a partial parity factor $F$ such that for each vertex $v$ with a given parity constraint, $| d_{F}(v)-\varepsilon d_G(v)|&lt; 2$, and for all other vertices $v$, $| d_{F}(v)-\varepsilon d_G(v)|\le 1$, where $\varepsilon $ is a real number and $0&lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$. Finally we introduce another application on the existence of almost even factorizations of odd-edge-connected graphs.</description>

      <title>The Briggs inequality for partitions and overpartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence of $\{a_n\}_{n\ge 0}$ satisfies the Briggs inequality if \begin{align*} a_n^2(a_n^2-a_{n-1}a_{n+1})&gt;a_{n-1}^2(a_{n+1}^2-a_na_{n+2}) \end{align*} holds for any $n\ge 1$. In this paper we show that both the partition function $\{p(n+N_0)\}_{n\geq 0}$ and the overpartition function $\{\overline{p}(n+\overline{N}_0)\}_{n\ge 0}$ satisfy the Briggs inequality for some $N_0$ and $\overline{N}_{0}$. Based on Chern's formula for $\eta$-quotients, we further prove that the $k$-regular partition function $\{p_k(n+N_{k})\}_{n\geq 0}$ and the $k$-regular overpartition function $\{\overline{p}_k(n+\overline{N}_k)\}_{n\ge 0}$ also satisfy the Briggs inequality for $2\le k\le 9$ and some $N_k,\overline{N}_{k}$.</description>

      <title>Hecke growth diagrams, and maximal increasing and decreasing sequences in fillings of stack polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a bijection between $01$-fillings of stack polyominoes with at most one $1$ per column and labelings of the corners along the top-right border of stack polyominoes. These labellings indicate the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing chains of the largest rectangular region below and to the left of the corners. Our results provide an alternative proof of Guo and Poznanovi\'c's theorem on the lengths of the longest increasing and decreasing chains have a symmetric joint distribution over $01$-fillings of stack polyomino. Moreover, our results offer new perspective to Chen, Guo and Pang's result on the crossing number and the nesting number have a symmetric joint distribution over linked partitions. In particular, our construction generalizes the growth diagram techniques of Rubey for the $01$-fillings of stack polyominoes with at most one $1$ per column and row.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker domination game critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maker-Breaker domination game (MBD game) is a two-player game played on a graph $G$ by Dominator and Staller. They alternately select unplayed vertices of $G$. The goal of Dominator is to form a dominating set with the set of vertices selected by him while that of Staller is to prevent this from happening. In this paper MBD game critical graphs are introduced. Their existence is established and critical graphs are characterized for most of the cases in which the first player can win the game in one or two moves.</description>

      <title>Quaternary Legendre pairs II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quaternary Legendre pairs are pertinent to the construction of quaternary Hadamard matrices and have many applications, for example in coding theory and communications.
  In contrast to binary Legendre pairs, quaternary ones can exist for even length $\ell$ as well. It is conjectured that there is a quaternary Legendre pair for any even $\ell$. Before, the smallest open case had been $\ell=28$ and $\ell=38$ was the only length $\le 60$ resolved before. Here we provide constructions for $\ell=28,30,32$, and $34$. In parallel and independently, Jedwab and Pender found a construction of quaternary Legendre pairs of length $\ell=(q-1)/2$ for any prime power $q\equiv 1\bmod 4$, which in particular covers $\ell=30$, $36$, and $40$, so that now $\ell=42$ is the smallest unresolved case.
  The main new idea of this paper is a way to separate the search for the subsequences along even and odd indices which substantially reduces the complexity of the search algorithm.
  In addition, we use Galois theory for cyclotomic fields to derive conditions which improve the PSD test.</description>

      <title>A Connection Between Unbordered Partial Words and Sparse Rulers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\textit{Partial words}$ are words that contain, in addition to letters, special symbols $\diamondsuit$ called $\textit{holes}$. Two partial words of $a=a_0 \dots a_n$ and $b=b_0 \dots b_n$ are $\textit{compatible}$ if for all $i$, $a_i = b_i$ or at least one of $a_i, b_i$ is a hole. A partial word is $\textit{unbordered}$ if it does not have a nonempty proper prefix and a suffix that are compatible. Otherwise the partial word is $\textit{bordered}$.
  A set $R \subseteq \{0, \dots, n\}$ is called a $\textit{complete sparse ruler of length $n$}$ if for all $k \in \{0, \dots, n\}$ there exists $r, s \in R$ such that $k = r - s$. These are also known as $\textit{restricted difference bases}$.
  From the definitions it follows that the more holes a partial word has, the more likely it is to be bordered. By introducing a connection between unbordered partial words and sparse rulers, we improve bounds on the maximum number of holes an unbordered partial word can have over alphabets of sizes $4$ or greater. We also provide a counterexample for a previously reported theorem.
  We then study a two-dimensional generalization of these results. We adapt methods from one-dimensional case to solve the correct asymptotic for the number of holes an unbordered two-dimensional binary partial word can have. This generalization might invoke further research questions.</description>

      <title>Half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'{o}sa property for non-null $S$-$T$ paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a group $\Gamma$, a $\Gamma$-labelled graph is an undirected graph $G$ where every orientation of an edge is assigned an element of $\Gamma$ so that opposite orientations of the same edge are assigned inverse elements. A path in $G$ is non-null if the product of the labels along the path is not the neutral element of $\Gamma$. We prove that for every finite group $\Gamma$, non-null $S$-$T$ paths in $\Gamma$-labelled graphs exhibit the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. More precisely, there is a function $f$, depending on $\Gamma$, such that for every $\Gamma$-labelled graph $G$, subsets of vertices $S$ and $T$, and integer $k$, one of the following objects exists: a family $\cal F$ consisting of $k$ non-null $S$-$T$ paths in $G$ such that every vertex of $G$ participates in at most two paths of $\cal F$; or a set $X$ consisting of at most $f(k)$ vertices that meets every non-null $S$-$T$ path in $G$. This in particular proves that in undirected graphs $S$-$T$ paths of odd length have the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define a new hypergraph $\mathcal{H(V,E)}$ on a loop $L$, where $\mathcal{V}$ is the set of points of the loop $L$ and $\mathcal{E}$ is the set of hyperedges $e=\{x,y,z\}$ such that $x,y$ and $z$ associate in the order they are written. We call this hypergraph as the associating hypergraph on a loop $L$. We study certain properites of associating hypergraphs on the Moufang loop $M(D_n,2)$, where $D_n$ denotes the dihedral group of order $2n$.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-cut algorithms for colorful components problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle three optimization problems in which a colored graph, where each node is assigned a color, must be partitioned into colorful connected components. A component is defined as colorful if each color appears at most once. The problems differ in the objective function, which determines which partition is the best one. These problems have applications in community detection, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We present integer non-linear formulations, which are then linearized using standard techniques. To solve these formulations, we develop exact branch-and-cut algorithms, embedding various improving techniques, such as valid inequalities, bounds limiting the number of variables, and warm-start and preprocessing techniques. Extensive computational tests on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. The branch-and-cut algorithms can solve reasonably sized instances efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an exact algorithm for solving these problems.</description>

      <title>Generating maps on oriented surfaces using the homomorphism principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we describe an algorithm that can be applied for the generation of various classes of maps on orientable surfaces. It uses existing generators for abstract graphs and combines them with an efficient embedding and isomorphism rejection routine. The generation rate of the program implementing the algorithm depends a lot on the class of maps to be generated, but is quite high -- more than a million non-isomorphic structures per second -- for some relevant classes of maps. The same program can also be used to embed specific graphs on a given orientable surface in all non-isomorphic ways. It can serve as a tool in many applications where classes of maps on orientable surfaces are studied and provides a very general independent test for specialized generation programs. We also give enumeration results for 3-regular, 4-regular, and 5-regular maps as well as all maps and some maps with just one face.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revisiting Kra\'skiewicz and Pragacz's construction of Schubert modules, we provide a new proof that their characters are equal to Schubert polynomials. The main innovation is a representation-theoretic interpretation of a recurrence relation for Schubert polynomials recently discovered by Nadeau, Spink, and Tewari. Along the way, we review several related constructions, and show that the Nadeau-Spink-Tewari recursion determines the characters of flagged Schur modules coming from a broader class of translucent diagrams.</description>

      <title>Modular Golomb rulers and almost difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(v,k,\lambda)$-difference set in a group $G$ of order $v$ is a subset $\{d_1, d_2, \ldots,d_k\}$ of $G$ such that $D=\sum d_i$ in the group ring ${\mathbb Z}[G]$ satisfies $$D D^{-1} = n + \lambda G,$$ where $n=k-\lambda$. In other words, the nonzero elements of $G$ all occur exactly $\lambda$ times as differences of elements in $D$.
  A $(v,k,\lambda,t)$-almost difference set has $t$ nonzero elements of $G$ occurring $\lambda$ times, and the other $v-1-t$ occurring $\lambda+1$ times. When $\lambda=0$, this is equivalent to a modular Golomb ruler. In this paper we investigate existence questions on these objects, and extend previous results constructing almost difference sets by adding or removing an element from a difference set.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property of tripods in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a directed graphs with distinguished sets of sources $S\subseteq V(D)$ and sinks $T\subseteq V(D)$. A tripod in $D$ is a subgraph consisting of the union of two $S$-$T$-paths that have distinct start-vertices and the same end-vertex, and are disjoint apart from sharing a suffix.
  We prove that tripods in directed graphs exhibit the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property. More precisely, there is a function $f\colon \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ such that for every digraph $D$ with sources $S$ and sinks $T$, if $D$ does not contain $k$ vertex-disjoint tripods, then there is a set of at most $f(k)$ vertices that meets all the tripods in $D$.</description>

      <title>On Criticality and Additivity of the Pseudoachromatic Number Under Join</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A vertex coloring of a graph is said to be pseudocomplete if, for any two distinct colors, there exists at least one edge with those two colors as its end vertices. The pseudoachromatic number of a graph is the greatest number of colors possible used in a pseudocomplete coloring. This paper studies properties relating to additivity of the pseudoachromatic number under the join. Errors from the literature are corrected and the notion of weakly critical is introduced in order to study the problem.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph saturation for the bow tie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and S\'os initiated the study of the maximum size of a $k$-uniform set system, for $k \geq 4$, with no singleton intersections $50$ years ago. In this work, we investigate the dual problem: finding the minimum size of a $k$-uniform hypergraph with no singleton intersections, such that adding any missing hyperedge forces a singleton intersection. These problems, known as saturation and semi-saturation, are typically challenging. Our focus is on an elementary-to-state case in the line of work by Erd\H{o}s, F\"uredi and Tuza. We establish tight linear bounds for $k=4$, marking one of the first non-obvious cases with such a bound.</description>

      <title>Orbits of permutation groups with no derangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial finite permutation group of degree $n$. If $G$ is transitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement. Equivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper subgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and this can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size $(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size exactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture when $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we conjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper subgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of the subgroups is maximal. We prove other cases of the conjecture, and we highlight connections our results have with intersecting families of permutations and roots of polynomials modulo primes. Along the way, we also prove a linear variant on Isbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study several combinatorial properties of finite groups that are related to the notions of sequenceability, R-sequenceability, and harmonious sequences. In particular, we show that in every abelian group $G$ with a unique involution $\imath_G$ there exists a permutation $g_0,\ldots, g_{m}$ of elements of $G \backslash \{\imath_G\}$ such that the consecutive sums $g_0+g_1, g_1+g_2,\ldots, g_{m}+g_0$ also form a permutation of elements of $G\backslash \{\imath_G\}$. We also show that in every abelian group of order at least 4 there exists a sequence containing each non-identity element of $G$ exactly twice such that the consecutive sums also contain each non-identity element of $G$ twice. We apply several results to the existence of transversals in Latin squares.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify the conjectures due to Lewis, Reiner and Stanton about the Hilbert series of the invariant ring of the truncated polynomial ring for all parabolic subgroups up to rank $3$. This is done by constructing an explicit set of generators for each invariant ring in question. We also propose a conjecture concerning the action of the Steenrod algebra and the Dickson algebra on a certain naturally occurring filtration of the invariant ring under the general linear group.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by applications to crystalline materials, we generalize the merge tree and the related barcode of a filtered complex to the periodic setting in Euclidean space. They are invariant under isometries, changing bases, and indeed changing lattices. In addition, we prove stability under perturbations and provide an algorithm that under mild geometric conditions typically satisfied by crystalline materials takes $\mathcal{O}({(n+m) \log n})$ time, in which $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of vertices and edges in the quotient complex, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We provide an algebraic-geometrical interpretation of the classical semistandard Young-tableaux via the notion of Seshadri stratifications. The columns appearing in such a tableau correspond to vanishing multiplicities of certain rational functions on Schubert varieties. To build a framework for this correspondence we generalize Seshadri stratifications to multiprojective varieties, which forms the largest part of this article.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadratic traveling salesperson problem (QTSP) is a generalization of the traveling salesperson problem, in which all triples of consecutive customers in a tour determine the travel cost. We propose compact optimization models for QTSP in mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), constraint programming (CP), and domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP). Our experimental results demonstrate that the DIDP model performs better than other approaches in optimality gap and solution quality when the problem size is large enough.</description>

      <title>Hypercontractivity on HDX II: Symmetrization and q-Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bourgain's symmetrization theorem is a powerful technique reducing boolean analysis on product spaces to the cube. It states that for any product $\Omega_i^{\otimes d}$, function $f: \Omega_i^{\otimes d} \to \mathbb{R}$, and $q &gt; 1$:
  $$||T_{\frac{1}{2}}f(x)||_q \leq ||\tilde{f}(r,x)||_{q} \leq ||T_{c_q}f(x)||_q$$ where $T_{\rho}f = \sum\limits \rho^Sf^{=S}$ is the noise operator and $\widetilde{f}(r,x) = \sum\limits r_Sf^{=S}(x)$ `symmetrizes' $f$ by convolving its Fourier components $\{f^{=S}\}_{S \subseteq [d]}$ with a random boolean string $r \in \{\pm 1\}^d$.
  In this work, we extend the symmetrization theorem to high dimensional expanders (HDX). Adapting work of O'Donnell and Zhao (2021), we give as a corollary a proof of optimal global hypercontractivity for partite HDX, resolving one of the main open questions of Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu (STOC 2022). Adapting work of Bourgain (JAMS 1999), we also give the first booster theorem for HDX, resolving a main open questions of Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett (STOC 2022).
  Our proof is based on two elementary new ideas in the theory of high dimensional expansion. First we introduce `$q$-norm HDX', generalizing standard spectral notions to higher moments, and observe every spectral HDX is a $q$-norm HDX. Second, we introduce a simple method of coordinate-wise analysis on HDX which breaks high dimensional random walks into coordinate-wise components, and allows each component to be analyzed as a $1$-dimensional operator locally within $X$. This allows for application of standard tricks such as the replacement method, greatly simplifying prior analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Fast and Simple $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-Edge-Coloring of Dense Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon \in (0, 1)$ and $n, \Delta \in \mathbb N$ be such that $\Delta = \Omega\left(\max\left\{\frac{\log n}{\epsilon},\, \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log \frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^2\right\}\right)$. Given an $n$-vertex $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$, we present a randomized $O\left(m\,\log^3 \Delta\,/\,\epsilon^2\right)$-time algorithm that computes a proper $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring of $G$ with high probability. This improves upon the best known results for a wide range of the parameters $\epsilon$, $n$, and $\Delta$. Our approach combines a flagging strategy from earlier work of the author with a shifting procedure employed by Duan, He, and Zhang for dynamic edge-coloring. The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and may be of practical interest.</description>

Abstract: Extended $1$-perfect codes in the Hamming scheme $H(n,q)$ can be equivalently defined as codes that turn to $1$-perfect codes after puncturing in any coordinate, as completely regular codes with certain intersection array, as uniformly packed codes with certain weight coefficients, as diameter perfect codes with respect to a certain anticode, as distance-$4$ codes with certain dual distances. We define extended $1$-perfect bitrades in $H(n,q)$ in five different manners, corresponding to the different definitions of extended $1$-perfect codes, and prove the equivalence of these definitions of extended $1$-perfect bitrades. For $q=2^m$, we prove that such bitrades exist if and only if $n=lq+2$. For any $q$, we prove the nonexistence of extended $1$-perfect bitrades if $n$ is odd.

      <title>Analysis of the Lifting Graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The `lifting` or `splitting-off` operation on graphs is performed by deleting two edges sv and sw having a common end s and adding a new edge between v and w. Such a lift is considered good if it preserves a certain local edge-connectivity between the pairs of vertices different from the vertex s at which lifting takes place. The operation is important for inductive proofs concerning edge-connectivity, and can be seen widely applied in the literature on connectivity augmentation, network design, orientation (of finite and infinite graphs), and edge-disjoint linkage. It was studied by Lovasz, who used the term splitting-off, and Mader, who used the term lifting. They proved the first two significant results on it, in 1976 and 1978 respectively, showing the existence of a good lift under certain conditions. Then it was used and studied by other researchers, through the 1980s, both for undirected and directed graphs. In particular, it was investigated further by Frank who proved in 1992 that there are floor of deg(s)/2 disjoint good lifts. Motivated by the applications, a new method for studying the operation was introduced by Jordan in the late 1990s. He defined and studied the structure of the `non-admissibility` graph, which is the complement of the lifting graph; the subject of this paper. He proved a number of significant structural results on it, which he applied to connectivity augmentation. Independently, in 2016, Thomassen defined the `lifting graph`, and called its complement the `bad graph`, to apply it in finding orientations of infinite graphs. Later in the same year, Thomassen with Ok and Richter extended the study, and applied their results to linkages in infinite graphs.
  Here we give a more comprehensive analysis of the structure of the lifting graph.</description>

      <title>Kneser graphs are Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03918v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For integers $k\geq 1$ and $n\geq 2k+1$, the Kneser graph $K(n,k)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element ground set, and an edge between any two disjoint sets. It has been conjectured since the 1970s that all Kneser graphs admit a Hamilton cycle, with one notable exception, namely the Petersen graph $K(5,2)$. This problem received considerable attention in the literature, including a recent solution for the sparsest case $n=2k+1$. The main contribution of this paper is to prove the conjecture in full generality. We also extend this Hamiltonicity result to all connected generalized Johnson graphs (except the Petersen graph). The generalized Johnson graph $J(n,k,s)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element ground set, and an edge between any two sets whose intersection has size exactly $s$. Clearly, we have $K(n,k)=J(n,k,0)$, i.e., generalized Johnson graph include Kneser graphs as a special case. Our results imply that all known natural families of vertex-transitive graphs defined by intersecting set systems have a Hamilton cycle, which settles an interesting special case of Lov\'asz' conjecture on Hamilton cycles in vertex-transitive graphs from 1970. Our main technical innovation is to study cycles in Kneser graphs by a kinetic system of multiple gliders that move at different speeds and that interact over time, reminiscent of the gliders in Conway's Game of Life, and to analyze this system combinatorially and via linear algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a variant of the celebrated Szemer\'edi--Trotter theorem, Guth and Katz proved that $m$ points and $n$ lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with at most $\sqrt{n}$ lines in a common plane must determine at most $O(m^{1/2}n^{3/4})$ incidences for $n^{1/2}\leq m\leq n^{3/2}$. This upper bound is asymptotically tight and has an important application in Erd\H{o}s distinct distance problem. We characterize the extremal constructions towards the Guth--Katz bound by proving that such a large dense point-line arrangement must contain a $k$-clique in general position provided $m \ll n$. This is an analog of a result by Solymosi for extremal Szemer\'edi--Trotter constructions in the plane.</description>

      <title>Between weak and Bruhat: the middle order on permutations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a partial order $\mathcal{P}_n$ on permutations of any given size $n$, which is the image of a natural partial order on inversion sequences. We call this the ``middle order''. We demonstrate that the poset $\mathcal{P}_n$ refines the weak order on permutations and admits the Bruhat order as a refinement, justifying the terminology. These middle orders are distributive lattices and we establish some of their combinatorial properties, including characterization and enumeration of intervals and boolean intervals (in general, or of any given rank), and a combinatorial interpretation of their Euler characteristic. We further study the (not so well-behaved) restriction of this poset to involutions, obtaining a simple formula for the M\"obius function of principal order ideals there. Finally, we offer further directions of research, initiating the study of the canonical Heyting algebra associated with $\mathcal{P}_n$, and defining a parking function analogue of $\mathcal{P}_n$.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical estimates of the diameters of the Rubik's Cube groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A strict lower bound for the diameter of a symmetric graph is proposed, which is calculable with the order ($n$) and other local parameters of the graph such as the degree ($k$), even girth $g$ ($\geq 4$), and number of $g$-cycles traversing a vertex, which are easily determined by inspecting a small portion of the graph (unless the girth is large). It is applied to the symmetric Cayley graphs of some Rubik's Cube groups of various sizes and metrics, yielding slightly tighter lower bounds of the diameters than those for random $k$-regular graphs proposed by Bollob\'{a}s and de la Vega. They range from 60% to 77% of the correct diameters of large-$n$ graphs.</description>

      <title>Unimodality and certain bivariate formal Laurent series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the unimodality and strict unimodality of certain formal bivariate Laurent series with non-negative coefficients. We show that the sets of these formal bivariate Laurent series form commutative semirings under the operations of addition and multiplication of formal Laurent series. This result is used to establish the unimodality of sequences involving Gauss polynomials and certain refined color partitions. In particular, we solve an open problem posed by Andrews on the unimodality of generalized Gauss polynomials and establish an unimodal result for a statistic of plane partitions. We also establish many unimodal results for rank statistics in partition theory, including the rank statistics of concave and convex compositions studied by Andrews, as well as certain unimodal sequences studied by Kim-Lim-Lovejoy. Additionally, we establish the unimodality of the Betti numbers and Gromov-Witten invariants of certain Hilbert schemes of points.</description>

      <title>A note on the 2-Factor Hamiltonicity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 2-factor Hamiltonicity Conjecture by Funk, Jackson, Labbate, and Sheehan [JCTB, 2003] asserts that all cubic, bipartite graphs in which all 2-factors are Hamiltonian cycles can be built using a simple operation starting from $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph.
  We discuss the link between this conjecture and matching theory, in particular by showing that this conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the two exceptional graphs in the conjecture are the only 2-factor Hamiltonian, cubic braces, where braces are connected, bipartite graphs in which every matching of size at most two is contained in a perfect matching. In the context of matching theory this conjecture is especially noteworthy as $K_{3,3}$ and the Heawood graph are both strongly tied to the important class of Pfaffian graphs, with $K_{3,3}$ being the canonical non-Pfaffian graph and the Heawood graph being one of the most noteworthy Pfaffian graphs.
  Our main contribution is a proof that the Heawood graph is the only 2-factor Hamiltonian, Pfaffian, cubic brace. This is shown by establishing that, aside from the Heawood graph, all Pfaffian braces contain a cycle of length four, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The nucleus of a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph with diameter $D\geq 1$. For a vertex $x$ of $\Gamma$ the corresponding subconstituent algebra $T=T(x)$ is generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $\Gamma$ and the dual adjacency matrix $A^*=A^*(x)$ of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We introduce a $T$-module $\mathcal N = \mathcal N(x)$ called the nucleus of $\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We describe $\mathcal N$ from various points of view. We show that all the irreducible $T$-submodules of $\mathcal N$ are thin. Under the assumption that $\Gamma$ is a nonbipartite dual polar graph, we give an explicit basis for $\mathcal N$ and the action of $A, A^*$ on this basis. The basis is in bijection with the set of elements for the projective geometry $L_D(q)$, where $GF(q)$ is the finite field used to define $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy groups and quantitative Sperner-type lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of Sperner's lemma for a triangulation $T$ of $(m+1)$-discs $D$ whose vertices are colored in $c=n+2$ colors. A proper coloring of $T$ on the boundary of $D$ determines a simplicial mapping $f:S^m \to S^n$ and the element $x=[f]$ in $\pi_m(S^n)$. For any element $x$ in this homotopy group we define a non--negative integer $\mu(x)$. For some cases this invariant can be found explicitly. Namely, if $m=n$ then this number is the Brouwer degree of the mapping $f$. For the case $m=3, n=2$ we found a lower bound for $\mu(x)$, where $x$ is the Hopf invariant, and proved that $\mu(1)=\mu(2)=9$. The main result of this paper is the theorem that the number of fully colored $n$-simplexes in $T$ is not less than $\mu([f])$. To prove this theorem, we use an extension of the Pontryagin theorem for relative framed cobordisms</description>

      <title>Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.
  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most $\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a joint introduction to classical and free probability, which are twin sisters. We first review the foundations of classical probability, notably with the main limiting theorems (CLT, CCLT, PLT, CPLT), and with a look into examples coming from Lie groups and random matrices. Then we present the foundations and main results of free probability, notably with free limiting theorems, and with a look into examples coming from quantum groups and random matrices. We discuss then a number of more advanced aspects, in relation with free geometry and with subfactor theory.</description>

      <title>Large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for zeros in character tables of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a brief report on some recent large-scale Monte Carlo simulations for approximating the density of zeros in character tables of large symmetric groups. Previous computations suggested that a large fraction of zeros cannot be explained by classical vanishing results. Our computations eclipse previous ones and suggest that the opposite is true. We find empirically that almost all of the zeros are of a single classical type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we characterize Cohen-Macaulay permutation graphs. In particular, we show that a permutation graph is Cohen-Macaulay if and only if it is well-covered and there exists a unique way of partitioning its vertex set into $r$ disjoint maximal cliques, where $r$ is the cardinality of a maximal independent set of the graph. We also provide some sufficient conditions for a comparability graph to be a uniquely partially orderable (UPO) graph.</description>

Abstract: Maesaka, Seki, and Watanabe recently discovered an equality called the MSW formula. This paper provides a $q$-analogue of the MSW formula. It discusses the new proof of the duality relation for finite multiple harmonic $q$-series at primitive roots of unity via $q$-analogue of the MSW formula. This paper also gives a $q$-analogue of Yamamoto's generalization of the MSW formula for Schur type.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences via Beukers' method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, using modular forms F. Beukers posed a unified method that can deal with a large number of supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Ap\'ery-like numbers. In this paper, we use Beukers' method to prove some conjectures of the first author concerning the congruences for $$\sum_{k=0}^{(p-1)/2}\frac{\binom{2k}k^3}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k^2\binom{4k}{2k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k\binom{3k}k\binom{6k}{3k}}{m^k}, \ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{V_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{T_n}{m^n},\ \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\frac{D_n}{m^n} $$ and $\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}(-1)^nA_n$ modulo $p^3$, where $p$ is an odd prime representable by some suitable binary quadratic form, $m$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, $V_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{2k}k^2\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}^2$, $T_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}n^2$, $D_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{2k}k\binom{2n-2k}{n-k}$ and $A_n$ is the Ap\'ery number given by $A_n=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom nk^2\binom{n+k}k^2$.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of Order-Divisor Graphs of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the properties of order-divisor graphs associated with finite groups. An order-divisor graph of a finite group is an undirected graph in which the set of vertices includes all elements of the group, and two distinct vertices with different orders are adjacent if the order of one vertex divides the order of the other. We prove some beautiful results in order-divisor graphs of finite groups. The primary focus is on examining the girth, degree of vertices, and size of the order-divisor graph. In particular, we provide a comprehensive description of these parameters for the order-divisor graphs of finite cyclic groups and dihedral groups.</description>
