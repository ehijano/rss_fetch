      <title>Key factors and network model for location-based cultural mobile game design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of smart devices as media for digital learning constitutes a new-generation digital learning paradigm. Therefore, context-aware game-based learning has attracted considerable attention. Location-based games have not only positive effects on learning but also pronounced effects on culture and history. Accordingly, focusing on railway cultural heritages, we attempted to assess interdependent relationships between key factors crucial for the design of a location-based mobile game for cultural heritages. We adopted the analytic network process (ANP) for our assessment. We initially performed a literature review to generalize relevant criteria and elements and developed a questionnaire based on the fuzzy delphi method (FDM); thus, key factors, namely 3 criteria and 15 elements, were selected. We also applied an online ANP-based questionnaire; on the basis of the experts opinions, we established a network model and determined the priority order of the key factors. The results revealed that experts considered culture learning to be of the highest importance, with the most important three elements being prior knowledge, challenge levels, and cultural narrative. In addition, culture learning exhibited a strong interaction with content design. In each criterion, one element had a considerable influence on the remaining elements, as determined by an analysis of matrices.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Stability and Assessing Uncertainty in Community Detection through a Consensus-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex data in social and natural sciences find effective representation through networks, wherein quantitative and categorical information can be associated with nodes and connecting edges. The internal structure of networks can be explored using unsupervised machine learning methods known as community detection algorithms. The process of community detection is inherently subject to uncertainty as algorithms utilize heuristic approaches and randomised procedures to explore vast solution spaces, resulting in non-deterministic outcomes and variability in detected communities across multiple runs. Moreover, many algorithms are not designed to identify outliers and may fail to take into account that a network is an unordered mathematical entity. The main aim of our work is to address these issues through a consensus-based approach by introducing a new framework called Consensus Community Detection (CCD). Our method can be applied to different community detection algorithms, allowing the quantification of uncertainty for the whole network as well as for each node, and providing three strategies for dealing with outliers: incorporate, highlight, or group. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated on artificial benchmark networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Twitter Bot Detection via Multimodal Invariant Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting Twitter Bots is crucial for maintaining the integrity of online discourse, safeguarding democratic processes, and preventing the spread of malicious propaganda. However, advanced Twitter Bots today often employ sophisticated feature manipulation and account farming techniques to blend seamlessly with genuine user interactions, posing significant challenges to existing detection models. In response to these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Twitter Bot Detection framework called BotSAI. This framework enhances the consistency of multimodal user features, accurately characterizing various modalities to distinguish between real users and bots. Specifically, the architecture integrates information from users, textual content, and heterogeneous network topologies, leveraging customized encoders to obtain comprehensive user feature representations. The heterogeneous network encoder efficiently aggregates information from neighboring nodes through oversampling techniques and local relationship transformers. Subsequently, a multi-channel representation mechanism maps user representations into invariant and specific subspaces, enhancing the feature vectors. Finally, a self-attention mechanism is introduced to integrate and refine the enhanced user representations, enabling efficient information interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BotSAI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two major Twitter Bot Detection benchmarks, exhibiting superior performance. Additionally, systematic experiments reveal the impact of different social relationships on detection accuracy, providing novel insights for the identification of social bots.</description>

      <title>Measuring interconnectedness of infectious diseases in funded and unfunded research: a temporal network analysis on bibliometric data 1995-2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial investments in infectious disease research over the past decades, the field continues to struggle with inadequate long-term investment strategies and resource disparities, which highlights the critical need for a better understanding of funding and research landscapes to support evidence-based policymaking. Our study presents a novel perspective on the interconnectedness of evolving infectious disease knowledge. Through identifying publications based on funded and unfunded research, the analysis of temporal network of infectious disease associations reveals (i) growing compartmentalisation of funded research, i.e., it focuses on the groups of infectious diseases with readily established connections, and (ii) the growth in global integration in unfunded research, i.e., it tends to be more widely exploratory and links distant diseases. Moreover, we find that in both funded and unfunded research prominent diseases like HIV, malaria and tuberculosis have strong bridging effects facilitating global integration, while diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are characterised with strong local connectivity between themselves. We also find that although coronavirus has seen a surge in publications since COVID-19, its systemic impact on the interconnectedness of infectious disease knowledge remains relatively low. Our work highlights the importance of considering the interconnectedness of infectious diseases in health policy making and has potential to contribute to more efficient health resource allocation.</description>

      <title>The Dawn of Decentralized Social Media: An Exploration of Bluesky's Public Opening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bluesky is a Twitter-like decentralized social media platform that has recently grown in popularity. After an invite-only period, it opened to the public worldwide on February 6th, 2024. In this paper, we provide a longitudinal analysis of user activity in the two months around the opening, studying changes in the general characteristics of the platform due to the rapid growth of the user base. We observe a broad distribution of activity similar to more established platforms, but a higher volume of original than reshared content, and very low toxicity. After opening to the public, Bluesky experienced a large surge in new users and activity, especially posting English and Japanese content. In particular, several accounts entered the discussion with suspicious behavior, like following many accounts and sharing content from low-credibility news outlets. Some of these have already been classified as spam or suspended, suggesting effective moderation.</description>

      <title>"Sharing, Not Showing Off": How BeReal Approaches Authentic Self-Presentation on Social Media Through Its Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the pressures created by social media, such as heightened self-consciousness and the need for extensive self-presentation. In this study, we investigate how BeReal, a social media platform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents' self-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand their experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on spontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and reciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of the audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by BeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing social comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived as limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic. Drawing on this empirical data, we distill a set of design guidelines for creating platforms that support authentic self-presentation online, such as scaffolding reciprocity and expanding beyond spontaneous photo-sharing to allow users to more accurately and comfortably portray themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm to approximate the percolation centrality of every node in a graph. Such a centrality measure quantifies the importance of the vertices in a network during a contagious process. In this paper, we present a randomized approximation algorithm that can compute probabilistically guaranteed high-quality percolation centrality estimates, generalizing techniques used by Pellegrina and Vandin (TKDD 2024) for the betweenness centrality. The estimation obtained by our algorithm is within $\varepsilon$ of the value with probability at least $1-\delta$, for fixed constants $\varepsilon,\delta \in (0,1)$. We our theoretical results with an extensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide empirical evidence that our algorithm improves the current state of the art in speed, and sample size while maintaining high accuracy of the percolation centrality estimates.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Similarity-based Efficient Global Aggregation for Heterophilous Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) realize great success in graph learning but suffer from performance loss when meeting heterophily, i.e. neighboring nodes are dissimilar, due to their local and uniform aggregation. Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose SIGMA, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that SIGMA inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SIGMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains 5$\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset \emph{pokec} with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</description>

      <title>Using mathematics to study how people influence each other's opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People sometimes change their opinions when they discuss things with other people. Researchers can use mathematics to study opinion changes in simplifications of real-life situations. These simplified settings, which are examples of mathematical models, help researchers explore how people influence each other through their social interactions. In today's digital world, these models can help us learn how to promote the spread of accurate information and reduce the spread of inaccurate information. In this article, we discuss a simple mathematical model of opinion changes that arise from social interactions. We briefly describe what such opinion models can tell us and how researchers try to make them more realistic.</description>

      <title>Television Discourse Decoded: Comprehensive Multimodal Analytics at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the complex task of analyzing televised debates, with a focus on a prime time news debate show from India. Previous methods, which often relied solely on text, fall short in capturing the multimodal essence of these debates. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive automated toolkit that employs advanced computer vision and speech-to-text techniques for large-scale multimedia analysis. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms and speech-to-text methods, we transcribe, diarize, and analyze thousands of YouTube videos of a prime-time television debate show in India. These debates are a central part of Indian media but have been criticized for compromised journalistic integrity and excessive dramatization. Our toolkit provides concrete metrics to assess bias and incivility, capturing a comprehensive multimedia perspective that includes text, audio utterances, and video frames. Our findings reveal significant biases in topic selection and panelist representation, along with alarming levels of incivility. This work offers a scalable, automated approach for future research in multimedia analysis, with profound implications for the quality of public discourse and democratic debate. To catalyze further research in this area, we also release the code, dataset collected and supplemental pdf.</description>

      <title>AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</description>
