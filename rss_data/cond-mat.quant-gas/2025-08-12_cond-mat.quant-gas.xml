      <title>Real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in Rydberg-atom lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Lack of collisional hydrodynamics in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gapless fracton quantum spin liquid and emergent photons in a 2D spin-1 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering. Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1) field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Classical fracton spin liquid and Hilbert space fragmentation in a 2D spin-$1/2$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical U(1) fracton spin liquids feature an extensive ground state degeneracy and follow an effective description in terms of a tensor Gauss' law where charges, so-called fractons, have restricted mobility. Here we introduce a simple spin model that realizes such a state by straightforward discretization of the higher-rank gauge theory on a square lattice. The simplicity of this construction offers direct insights into the system's fundamental fractonic properties, such as real-space fracton configurations, height-field representation of the classical ground state manifold as well as properties of local and non-local fluctuations within the fracton-free subspace. By sampling classical Ising states from the extensive ground state manifold, we show that the effective tensor Gauss' law remains intact when explicitly enforcing the spin-1/2 length constraint, demonstrating the existence of a classical Ising fracton spin liquid. However, we observe that perturbative quantum effects are insufficient to efficiently tunnel between classical ground states, leading to severe Hilbert space fragmentation which obscures fractonic quantum behavior. Specifically, by simulating the spin-1/2 quantum model with Green function Monte Carlo as a function of the Rokhsar-Kivelson potential, we find that the system supports either magnetic long-range order or a classical spin liquid. Our findings highlight the crucial role of Hilbert-space fragmentation in fractonic spin systems but also indicate ways to mitigate such effects via increasing the spin magnitude to $S=1$, investigated in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>Quantized Thouless Pumping of Dark Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinearity enables the emergence of localized waves such as solitons that maintain their shapes during propagation. Solitons are broadly classified into bright and dark solitons. While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a dark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A distinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave function, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic superfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo quantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton functions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless pumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from bright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both integer and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a continuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model. Specifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit cell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system parameter is slowly varied over one cycle. Our work opens new avenues for exploring Thouless pumping for defects with phase changes, such as dark solitons, vortex solitons, ring dark solitons, and vortices.</description>

      <title>Ion Coulomb crystals: an exotic form of condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence. These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective. We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.</description>

      <title>Universally Robust Control of Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($&gt;\!99\%$) across diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state qubits.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-induced Half Quantized Conductance in One-dimensional Topological Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized conductance from topologically protected edge states is a hallmark of two-dimensional topological phases. In contrast, edge states in one-dimensional (1D) topological systems cannot transmit current across the insulating bulk, rendering their topological nature invisible in transport. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with gain and loss, and show that the zero-energy conductance exhibits qualitatively distinct behaviors between the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases, depending on the hybridization and dissipation strengths. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate that the conductance can become half-quantized in the topologically nontrivial phase, a feature absent in the trivial phase. We further show that the half quantization predominantly originates from transport channels involving gain/loss and edge states. Our results uncover a new mechanism for realizing quantized transport in 1D topological systems and highlight the nontrivial role of dissipation in enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.</description>

      <title>Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov States and Topological Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Altermagnets: an Analytical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical study of the ground-state phase diagram for dilute two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi gases exhibiting $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting under $s$-wave pairing. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field framework, four distinct phases are identified: a Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper-type superfluid, a normal metallic phase, a nodal superfluid with topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (TBFSs), and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states with finite center-of-mass momentum. Among these, the FFLO states and TBFSs exemplify two unconventional forms of superconductivity. Considering the simplicity of this model, with only one band, zero net magnetization, and $s$-wave paring, the emergence of both unconventional phases underscores the pivotal role of altermagnetic spin splitting in enabling exotic pairing phenomena. This analytical study not only offers a valuable benchmark for future numerical simulations, but also provides a concrete experimental roadmap for realizing FFLO states and TBFSs in altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Master Equation for Quantum Self-Organization of Atoms and Molecules in Cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is essential for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.</description>

Abstract: Despite the fundamentally different dissipation mechanisms, many laws and phenomena of classical turbulence equivalently manifest in quantum turbulence. The Reynolds law of dynamical similarity states that two objects of same geometry across different length scales are hydrodynamically equivalent under the same Reynolds number, leading to a universal drag coefficient law. In this work we confirm the existence of a universal drag law in a superfluid wake, facilitated by the nucleation of quantized vortices. We numerically study superfluid flow across a range of Reynolds numbers for the paradigmatic classical hard-wall and the Gaussian obstacle, popular in experimental quantum hydrodynamics. In addition, we provide a feasible method for measuring superfluid drag forces in an experimental environment using control volumes.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions</title>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Experimental protocol for observing single quantum many-body scars with transmon qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables, in systems where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states evenly spaced in energy. It is thus an interesting question whether even single isolated scars, which theoretically embody the weakest possibile violation of eigenstate thermalization and may be thought to have no detectable impact in experiments, can leave a trace in measurable quantities. Moreover, single scars offer an interesting scenario for exploring the connection between quantum many-body scars and the original notion of scarring in quantum dynamical systems theory. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>
