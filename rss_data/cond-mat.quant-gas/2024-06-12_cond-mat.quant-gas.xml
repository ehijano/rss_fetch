      <title>Engineering impurity Bell states through coupling with a quantum bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate the feasibility of creating Bell states in multi-component ultra-cold atomic gases by solely using the ability to control the inter-particle interactions via Feshbach resonances. For this we consider two distinguishable impurities immersed in an atomic background cloud of a few bosons, with the entire system being confined in a one-dimensional harmonic trap. By analyzing the numerically obtained ground states we demonstrate that the two impurities can form spatially entangled bipolaron states due to mediated interactions from the bosonic bath. Our analysis is based on calculating the correlations between the two impurities in a two-mode basis, which is experimentally accessible by measuring the particles positions in the left or right sides of the trap. While interspecies interactions are crucial in order to create the strongly entangled impurity states, it can also inhibit correlations depending on the ordering of the impurities and three-body impurity-bath correlations. We show how these drawbacks can be mitigated by manipulating the properties of the bath, namely its size, mass and intraspecies interactions, allowing to create impurity Bell states over a wide range of impurity-impurity interactions.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate plateau transition and equilibration in 1D quantum lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a remarkable spectral phenomenon in a generic type of quantum lattice gas model. As the interaction strength increases, eigenstates spontaneously reorganize and lead to plateaus of the interaction energy, with gaps opening akin to continuous phase transitions. Perturbation theory identifies a hidden structure underlying eigenstates within each plateau, resulting in a statistical shift in the wavefunction amplitudes described by extreme value theory. The structured eigenstates manifest themselves naturally in far-from-equilibrium dynamics proceeding through multiple universal stages. Our findings reveal a profound connection between emergent properties in high-energy states and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, providing insights into the impact of interactions across the entire energy spectrum. The results are directly relevant to experiments probing equilibration in quantum spin and lattice gases.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of superfluidity in atom-number-imbalanced two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superfluid and dissipative regimes in the dynamics of a two-component quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with unequal atom numbers in the components have been explored. The system supports localized waves of the symbiotic type owing to the same-species repulsion and cross-species attraction. The minority BEC component moves through the majority component and creates excitations. To quantify the emerging excitations we introduce a time-dependent function called disturbance. Through numerical simulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations with periodic boundary conditions, we have revealed a critical velocity of the localized wave, above which a transition from superfluid to dissipative regime occurs, evidenced by a sharp increase in the disturbance function. The factors responsible for the discrepancy between the actual critical velocity and the speed of sound, expected from theoretical arguments, have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided weak-form discovery of reduced-order models for trapped ultracold hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a highly collisional, ultracold but nondegenerate gas of polar molecules. Confined within a harmonic trap, the gas is subject to fluid-gaseous coupled dynamics that lead to a breakdown of first-order hydrodynamics. An attempt to treat these higher-order hydrodynamic effects was previously made with a Gaussian ansatz and coarse-graining model parameter [R. R. W. Wang &amp; J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 108, 013322 (2023)], leading to an approximate set of equations for a few collective observables accessible to experiments. Here we present substantially improved reduced-order models for these same observables, admissible beyond previous parameter regimes, discovered directly from particle simulations using the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics). The interpretable nature of the learning algorithm enables estimation of previously unknown physical quantities and discovery of model terms with candidate physical mechanisms, revealing new physics in mixed collisional regimes. Our approach constitutes a general framework for data-driven model identification leveraging known physics.</description>

      <title>Coherent Three-Photon Excitation of the Strontium Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently demonstrated a steady-state Bose-Einstein condensate of strontium atoms. We could turn this into a perpetual atom laser if an efficient outcoupling mechanism is found. Here we show a coherent three-photon excitation of the clock transition in a strontium BEC with contrast of over 50\%. We follow it up with a demonstration of three-photon STIRAP-like transfer. In the future, we could use this process to coherently outcouple the atoms from a trap operating at tune-out wavelength.</description>

      <title>Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and unified non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially-localized edge modes, has led to numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to the traditional exponential localization, this manuscript reports a new kind of non-Hermitian skin effect, which we term the ``algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect." This effect emerges across a diverse spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in both two- and higher space dimensions. For 2D systems with algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect, on geometries such as a torus or cylinder, these systems exhibit behavior reminiscent of the conventional non-Hermitian skin effect, where eigenmodes are either bulk Bloch waves (on a torus) or exponentially localized edge modes (on a cylinder). However, if the same system is placed on a disk or any geometrical shape featuring open boundaries in all directions, the skin modes immediately transform into the algebraic form, with amplitude decaying as a power-law function of the distance from the boundary. To explore these novel effects, we formulate a unified generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ) framework that is universally applicable to all variations of non-Hermitian skin effects across any spatial dimension, developed through the usage of a generalized transfer-matrix approach. We find that in a $d$-dimensional non-Hermitian system, in general, the GBZ manifold's dimensionality must fall into the range from $d$ to $2d-1$, denoted by ${d \leq \dim\text{GBZ} \leq 2d-1}$. In 1D, this inequality is trivial because the upper and lower bounds converge, forcing the GBZ's dimensionality to match with that of the physical space. However, in 2D and above, this inequality indicates that there is no obligation for the GBZ's dimensionality to concur with the physical space's dimensionality, which gives rise to a new class of non-Hermitian skin effects.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Tractable Generation of High-Order Rogue Waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study a prototypical, experimentally accessible scenario that enables the systematic generation of so-called high-order rogue waves in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. These waveforms lead to significantly and controllably more extreme focusing events than the famous Peregrine soliton. In one spatial dimension, we showcase conclusive numerical evidence that our scheme generates the focusing behavior associated with the first four rogue waves from the relevant hierarchy. We then extend considerations to anisotropic two-dimensional and even three-dimensional settings, establishing that the scheme can generate second order rogue waves despite the well-known limitation of finite-time blow up of focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations.</description>

      <title>The renormalized classical spin liquid on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental detection of the onset of a dynamically prepared, gapped $Z_2$ quantum spin liquid on the ruby lattice brought the physics of frustrated magnetism and lattice gauge theory to Rydberg tweezer arrays (Semeghini et al, Science 374, 1242 (2021)). The thermodynamic properties of such models remain inadequately addressed, yet knowledge thereof is indispensable if one wants to prepare large, robust, and long-lived quantum spin liquids. Using large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations we find in the PXP model a renormalized classical spin liquid with constant entropy density $S/N$ approaching $\ln(2)/6$ in the thermodynamic limit for all moderate and large values of the detuning $\delta$ and starting from $T/\Omega \sim 0.5$ (in units of the Rabi frequency $\Omega$) down to the lowest temperatures we could simulate, $T/\Omega \sim 0.01$. With Van der Waals interactions, constant entropy plateaus are still found but its value shifts with $\delta$. We comment the adiabatic approximation to the dynamical ramps for the electric degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of the Landau-Lifshitz one-dimensional magnet, with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>Stable SAP-like collective charging of ultracold atoms quantum batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum battery realized with a few interacting particles in a three-well system with different on-site energies, which could be realized with ultracold atom platforms. We prepare the initial state in the lowest energy well and charge the battery using a Spatial Adiabatic Passage (SAP)-based protocol, enabling the population of a higher energy well. We examine the charging under varying interaction strengths and reveal that the consideration of collective charging results in an intriguing oscillatory behavior of the final charge for finite interactions, through diabatic evolution. Our findings open a new avenue for building stable and controllable quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates how the closed channel of a Feshbach resonance is characterised by experimental observables. Surprisingly, it is found that the two-body observables associated with the Feshbach resonance can be insensitive to the properties of the closed channel. In particular, it is impossible in this situation to determine the energy of the bound state causing the resonance from the usual experimental data. This is the case for all magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold atoms, due to their deep two-body interaction potentials. This insensitivity highlights a major difference with Feshbach resonances that involve shallow interaction potentials, such as hadron resonances. It appears however that short-range two-body correlations and three-body observables are affected by a parameter of the closed channel called the "closed-channel scattering length". A photoassociation experiment is proposed to measure this parameter in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned from global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench are influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted through the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points, thereby precisely delineating phase boundaries. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing single-site observables.</description>
