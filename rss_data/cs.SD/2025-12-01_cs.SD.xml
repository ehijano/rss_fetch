      <title>Advancing Marine Bioacoustics with Deep Generative Models: A Hybrid Augmentation Strategy for Southern Resident Killer Whale Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated detection and classification of marine mammals vocalizations is critical for conservation and management efforts but is hindered by limited annotated datasets and the acoustic complexity of real-world marine environments. Data augmentation has proven to be an effective strategy to address this limitation by increasing dataset diversity and improving model generalization without requiring additional field data. However, most augmentation techniques used to date rely on effective but relatively simple transformations, leaving open the question of whether deep generative models can provide additional benefits. In this study, we evaluate the potential of deep generative for data augmentation in marine mammal call detection including: Variational Autoencoders, Generative Adversarial Networks, and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models. Using Southern Resident Killer Whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from two long-term hydrophone deployments in the Salish Sea, we compare these approaches against traditional augmentation methods such as time-shifting and vocalization masking. While all generative approaches improved classification performance relative to the baseline, diffusion-based augmentation yielded the highest recall (0.87) and overall F1-score (0.75). A hybrid strategy combining generative-based synthesis with traditional methods achieved the best overall performance with an F1-score of 0.81. We hope this study encourages further exploration of deep generative models as complementary augmentation strategies to advance acoustic monitoring of threatened marine mammal populations.</description>

      <title>GLA-Grad++: An Improved Griffin-Lim Guided Diffusion Model for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have positioned them as powerful generative frameworks for speech synthesis, demonstrating substantial improvements in audio quality and stability. Nevertheless, their effectiveness in vocoders conditioned on mel spectrograms remains constrained, particularly when the conditioning diverges from the training distribution. The recently proposed GLA-Grad model introduced a phase-aware extension to the WaveGrad vocoder that integrated the Griffin-Lim algorithm (GLA) into the reverse process to reduce inconsistencies between generated signals and conditioning mel spectrogram. In this paper, we further improve GLA-Grad through an innovative choice in how to apply the correction. Particularly, we compute the correction term only once, with a single application of GLA, to accelerate the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the baseline models, particularly in out-of-domain scenarios.</description>

      <title>PURE Codec: Progressive Unfolding of Residual Entropy for Speech Codec Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural speech codecs have achieved strong performance in low-bitrate compression, but residual vector quantization (RVQ) often suffers from unstable training and ineffective decomposition, limiting reconstruction quality and efficiency. We propose PURE Codec (Progressive Unfolding of Residual Entropy), a novel framework that guides multi-stage quantization using a pre-trained speech enhancement model. The first quantization stage reconstructs low-entropy, denoised speech embeddings, while subsequent stages encode residual high-entropy components. This design improves training stability significantly. Experiments demonstrate that PURE consistently outperforms conventional RVQ-based codecs in reconstruction and downstream speech language model-based text-to-speech, particularly under noisy training conditions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Fusion and Calibration of Neural Speaker Diarization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22696v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND) systems produce frame-level probabilistic speaker activity estimates, yet since evaluation focuses primarily on Diarization Error Rate (DER), the reliability and calibration of these confidence scores have been largely neglected. When fusing multiple diarization systems, DOVER-Lap remains the only established approach, operating at the segment level with hard decisions. We propose working with continuous probability outputs, which enables more sophisticated fusion and calibration techniques that can leverage model uncertainty and complementary strengths across different architectures. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for calibrating and fusing EEND models at the probability level. We investigate two output formulations (multilabel and powerset representations) and their impact on calibration and fusion effectiveness. Through extensive experiments on the CallHome two-speaker benchmark, we demonstrate that proper calibration provides substantial improvements even for individual models (up to 19% relative DER reduction), in some cases mitigating the absence of domain adaptation. We reveal that joint calibration in powerset space consistently outperforms independent per-speaker calibration, that fusion substantially improves over individual models, and that the Fuse-then-Calibrate ordering generally outperforms both calibrating before fusion and uncalibrated fusion while requiring calibration of only a single combined model. Our best configuration outperforms DOVER-Lap in terms of DER while providing reliable confidence estimates essential for downstream applications. This work proposes best practices for probability-level fusion of EEND systems and demonstrates the advantages of leveraging soft outputs over hard decisions.</description>

      <title>HPSU: A Benchmark for Human-Level Perception in Real-World Spoken Speech Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs) have led to great progress in speech understanding tasks such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). However, whether these models can achieve human-level auditory perception, particularly in terms of their ability to comprehend latent intentions and implicit emotions in real-world spoken language, remains underexplored. To this end, we introduce the Human-level Perception in Spoken Speech Understanding (HPSU), a new benchmark for fully evaluating the human-level perceptual and understanding capabilities of Speech LLMs. HPSU comprises over 20,000 expert-validated spoken language understanding samples in English and Chinese. It establishes a comprehensive evaluation framework by encompassing a spectrum of tasks, ranging from basic speaker attribute recognition to complex inference of latent intentions and implicit emotions. To address the issues of data scarcity and high cost of manual annotation in real-world scenarios, we developed a semi-automatic annotation process. This process fuses audio, textual, and visual information to enable precise speech understanding and labeling, thus enhancing both annotation efficiency and quality. We systematically evaluate various open-source and proprietary Speech LLMs. The results demonstrate that even top-performing models still fall considerably short of human capabilities in understanding genuine spoken interactions. Consequently, HPSU will be useful for guiding the development of Speech LLMs toward human-level perception and cognition.</description>

      <title>On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Pre-trained wav2vec2-based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using representations provided by a large pre-trained model has become the primary strategy for achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks. A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language. With these findings, we aim to assist the scientific community in utilizing existing wav2vec2-based pre-trained models, as well as facilitate the pre-training of new ones.</description>

      <title>3MDiT: Unified Tri-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Text-Driven Synchronized Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have recently achieved impressive visual quality, yet most systems still generate silent clips and treat audio as a secondary concern. Existing audio-video generation pipelines typically decompose the task into cascaded stages, which accumulate errors across modalities and are trained under separate objectives. Recent joint audio-video generators alleviate this issue but often rely on dual-tower architectures with ad-hoc cross-modal bridges and static, single-shot text conditioning, making it difficult to both reuse T2V backbones and to reason about how audio, video and language interact over time. To address these challenges, we propose 3MDiT, a unified tri-modal diffusion transformer for text-driven synchronized audio-video generation. Our framework models video, audio and text as jointly evolving streams: an isomorphic audio branch mirrors a T2V backbone, tri-modal omni-blocks perform feature-level fusion across the three modalities, and an optional dynamic text conditioning mechanism updates the text representation as audio and video evidence co-evolve. The design supports two regimes: training from scratch on audio-video data, and orthogonally adapting a pretrained T2V model without modifying its backbone. Experiments show that our approach generates high-quality videos and realistic audio while consistently improving audio-video synchronization and tri-modal alignment across a range of quantitative metrics.</description>

      <title>Joint Speech and Text Training for LLM-Based End-to-End Spoken Dialogue State Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue state tracking (DST) is made difficult by the tandem of having to handle speech input and data scarcity. Combining speech foundation encoders and large language models has been proposed in recent work as to alleviate some of this difficulty. Although this approach has been shown to result in strong spoken DST models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic multi-turn DST, it struggles to generalize across domains and requires annotated spoken DST training data for each domain of interest. However, collecting such data for every target domain is both costly and difficult. Noting that textual DST data is more easily obtained for various domains, in this work, we propose jointly training on available spoken DST data and written textual data from other domains as a way to achieve cross-domain generalization. We conduct experiments which show the efficacy of our proposed method for getting good cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from the target domains.</description>

      <title>Adapting Neural Audio Codecs to EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG and audio are inherently distinct modalities, differing in sampling rate, channel structure, and scale. Yet, we show that pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression, provided that the data are preprocessed to be suitable to the codec's input constraints. Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bridging Speech Emotion Recognition and Personality: Dataset and Temporal Interaction Condition Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the interaction between personality traits and emotion expression, exploring how personality information can improve speech emotion recognition (SER). We collect the personality annotation for the IEMOCAP dataset, making it the first speech dataset that contains both emotion and personality annotations (PA-IEMOCAP), and enabling direct integration of personality traits into SER. Statistical analysis on this dataset identified significant correlations between personality traits and emotional expressions. To extract finegrained personality features, we propose a temporal interaction condition network (TICN), in which personality features are integrated with HuBERT-based acoustic features for SER. Experiments show that incorporating ground-truth personality traits significantly enhances valence recognition, improving the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) from 0.698 to 0.785 compared to the baseline without personality information. For practical applications in dialogue systems where personality information about the user is unavailable, we develop a front-end module of automatic personality recognition. Using these automatically predicted traits as inputs to our proposed TICN model, we achieve a CCC of 0.776 for valence recognition, representing an 11.17% relative improvement over the baseline. These findings confirm the effectiveness of personality-aware SER and provide a solid foundation for further exploration in personality-aware speech processing applications.</description>

      <title>LAPS-Diff: A Diffusion-Based Framework for Singing Voice Synthesis With Language Aware Prosody-Style Guided Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) has seen significant advancements in recent years due to the rapid progress of diffusion-based approaches. However, capturing vocal style, genre-specific pitch inflections, and language-dependent characteristics remains challenging, particularly in low-resource scenarios. To address this, we propose LAPS-Diff, a diffusion model integrated with language-aware embeddings and a vocal-style guided learning mechanism, specifically designed for Bollywood Hindi singing style. We curate a Hindi SVS dataset and leverage pre-trained language models to extract word and phone-level embeddings for an enriched lyrics representation. Additionally, we incorporated a style encoder and a pitch extraction model to compute style and pitch losses, capturing features essential to the naturalness and expressiveness of the synthesized singing, particularly in terms of vocal style and pitch variations. Furthermore, we utilize MERT and IndicWav2Vec models to extract musical and contextual embeddings, serving as conditional priors to refine the acoustic feature generation process further. Based on objective and subjective evaluations, we demonstrate that LAPS-Diff significantly improves the quality of the generated samples compared to the considered state-of-the-art (SOTA) model for our constrained dataset that is typical of the low resource scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how machine learning models acquire the ability to compose music and how musical information is internally represented within such models. We develop a composition algorithm based on a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), a simple generative model capable of producing musical pieces of arbitrary length. We convert musical scores into piano-roll image representations and train the RBM in an unsupervised manner. We confirm that the trained RBM can generate new musical pieces; however, by analyzing the model's responses and internal structure, we find that the learned information is not stored in a form directly interpretable by humans. This study contributes to a better understanding of how machine learning models capable of music composition may internally represent musical structure and highlights issues related to the interpretability of generative models in creative tasks.</description>

      <title>Neural Audio Codecs for Prompt-Driven Universal Sound Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11717v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Text-guided sound separation supports flexible audio editing across media and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols, \textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR) while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$ less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human communication is multimodal, with speech and gestures tightly coupled, yet most computational methods for generating speech and gestures synthesize them sequentially, weakening synchrony and prosody alignment. We introduce Gelina, a unified framework that jointly synthesizes speech and co-speech gestures from text using interleaved token sequences in a discrete autoregressive backbone, with modality-specific decoders. Gelina supports multi-speaker and multi-style cloning and enables gesture-only synthesis from speech inputs. Subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate competitive speech quality and improved gesture generation over unimodal baselines.</description>

      <title>STAR-Bench: Probing Deep Spatio-Temporal Reasoning as Audio 4D Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\% temporal, -35.2\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.</description>

      <title>Video Echoed in Music: Semantic, Temporal, and Rhythmic Alignment for Video-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-to-Music generation seeks to generate musically appropriate background music that enhances audiovisual immersion for videos. However, current approaches suffer from two critical limitations: 1) incomplete representation of video details, leading to weak alignment, and 2) inadequate temporal and rhythmic correspondence, particularly in achieving precise beat synchronization. To address the challenges, we propose Video Echoed in Music (VeM), a latent music diffusion that generates high-quality soundtracks with semantic, temporal, and rhythmic alignment for input videos. To capture video details comprehensively, VeM employs a hierarchical video parsing that acts as a music conductor, orchestrating multi-level information across modalities. Modality-specific encoders, coupled with a storyboard-guided cross-attention mechanism (SG-CAtt), integrate semantic cues while maintaining temporal coherence through position and duration encoding. For rhythmic precision, the frame-level transition-beat aligner and adapter (TB-As) dynamically synchronize visual scene transitions with music beats. We further contribute a novel video-music paired dataset sourced from e-commerce advertisements and video-sharing platforms, which imposes stricter transition-beat synchronization requirements. Meanwhile, we introduce novel metrics tailored to the task. Experimental results demonstrate superiority, particularly in semantic relevance and rhythmic precision.</description>

      <title>PrismAudio: Decomposed Chain-of-Thoughts and Multi-dimensional Rewards for Video-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation requires balancing four critical perceptual dimensions: semantic consistency, audio-visual temporal synchrony, aesthetic quality, and spatial accuracy; yet existing methods suffer from objective entanglement that conflates competing goals in single loss functions and lack human preference alignment. We introduce PrismAudio, the first framework to integrate Reinforcement Learning into V2A generation with specialized Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning. Our approach decomposes monolithic reasoning into four specialized CoT modules (Semantic, Temporal, Aesthetic, and Spatial CoT), each paired with targeted reward functions. This CoT-reward correspondence enables multidimensional RL optimization that guides the model to jointly generate better reasoning across all perspectives, solving the objective entanglement problem while preserving interpretability. To make this optimization computationally practical, we propose Fast-GRPO, which employs hybrid ODE-SDE sampling that dramatically reduces the training overhead compared to existing GRPO implementations. We also introduce AudioCanvas, a rigorous benchmark that is more distributionally balanced and covers more realistically diverse and challenging scenarios than existing datasets, with 300 single-event classes and 501 multi-event samples. Experimental results demonstrate that PrismAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four perceptual dimensions on both the in-domain VGGSound test set and out-of-domain AudioCanvas benchmark.

      <title>Comparison Performance of Spectrogram and Scalogram as Input of Acoustic Recognition Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03611v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic recognition has emerged as a prominent task in deep learning research, frequently utilizing spectral feature extraction techniques such as the spectrogram from the Short-Time Fourier Transform and the scalogram from the Wavelet Transform. However, there is a notable deficiency in studies that comprehensively discuss the advantages, drawbacks, and performance comparisons of these methods. This paper aims to evaluate the characteristics of these two transforms as input data for acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks. The performance of the trained models employing both transforms is documented for comparison. Through this analysis, the paper elucidates the advantages and limitations of each method, provides insights into their respective application scenarios, and identifies potential directions for further research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scalogram for Computational Complexity Reduction in Acoustic Recognition Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13017v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is an effective tool for feature extraction in acoustic recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when applied to non-stationary audio. However, its high computational cost poses a significant challenge, often leading researchers to prefer alternative methods such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT). To address this issue, this paper proposes a method to reduce the computational complexity of CWT by optimizing the length of the wavelet kernel and the hop size of the output scalogram. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining the robust performance of the trained model in acoustic recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>LongCat-Flash-Omni Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Omni, a state-of-the-art open-source omni-modal model with 560 billion parameters, excelling at real-time audio-visual interaction. By adopting a curriculum-inspired progressive training strategy that transitions from simpler to increasingly complex modality sequence modeling tasks, LongCat-Flash-Omni attains comprehensive multimodal capabilities while maintaining strong unimodal capability. Building upon LongCat-Flash, which adopts a high-performance Shortcut-connected Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with zero-computation experts, LongCat-Flash-Omni integrates efficient multimodal perception and speech reconstruction modules. Despite its immense size of 560B parameters (with 27B activated), LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves low-latency real-time audio-visual interaction. For training infrastructure, we developed a modality-decoupled parallelism scheme specifically designed to manage the data and model heterogeneity inherent in large-scale multimodal training. This innovative approach demonstrates exceptional efficiency by sustaining over 90% of the throughput achieved by text-only training. Extensive evaluations show that LongCat-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art performance on omni-modal benchmarks among open-source models. Furthermore, it delivers highly competitive results across a wide range of modality-specific tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as audio understanding and generation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture design, training procedures, and data strategies, and open-source the model to foster future research and development in the community.</description>
