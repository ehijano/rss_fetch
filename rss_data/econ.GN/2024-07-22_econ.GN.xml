      <title>The Software Complexity of Nations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing importance of the digital sector, research on economic complexity and its implications continues to rely mostly on administrative records, e.g. data on exports, patents, and employment, that fail to capture the nuances of the digital economy. In this paper we use data on the geography of programming languages used in open-source software projects to extend economic complexity ideas to the digital economy. We estimate a country's software economic complexity and show that it complements the ability of measures of complexity based on trade, patents, and research papers to account for international differences in GDP per capita, income inequality, and emissions. We also show that open-source software follows the principle of relatedness, meaning that a country's software entries and exits are explained by specialization in related programming languages. We conclude by exploring the diversification and development of countries in open-source software in the context of large language models. Together, these findings help extend economic complexity methods and their policy considerations to the digital sector.</description>

      <title>In Search of (Factor-Biased) Learning by Exporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exporting plants often undergo significant technology upgrades, becoming more productive than their domestic counterparts. This process, called learning by exporting, is usually modeled as a Hicks-neutral TFP shifter, overlooking factor-biased technical improvements. We develop a dynamic model of production, exporting, and capital investment that incorporates factor-augmenting efficiencies. We find that exporting increases TFP by 9%, skilled labor productivity by 2%, and unskilled labor productivity by 8%. For new exporters, skilled labor productivity rises by 45%, and unskilled labor productivity increases by 75% within four years of entering export markets.</description>

      <title>Rational Bubbles: A Clarification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Rational bubble", as introduced by the famous paper on money by Samuelson (1958), means speculation backed by nothing. The large subsequent rational bubble literature has identified attaching bubbles to dividend-paying assets in a natural way as an important but challenging question. Miao and Wang (2018) claim to "provide a theory of rational stock price bubbles". Contrary to their claim, the present comment proves the nonexistence of rational bubbles in the model of Miao and Wang (2018). We also clarify the precise mathematical definition and the economic meaning of "rational bubble" in an accessible way to the general audience.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecks in Occupational Transitions: A Data-driven Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mobility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.</description>

      <title>The time-space evolution of economic activities: theory and estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the evolution of economic activities using a continuous time-space aggregation-diffusion model, which encompasses competing effects of agglomeration and congestion. To bring the model to the real data, a novel discretization technique over time and space is introduced, which is able to disentangle the spatial effects into pure topography, agglomeration, repulsion, and diffusion forces. The estimate for the Italian municipalities' personal income over the period 2008-2019 supports the models' main predictions and outperforms the most common spatial econometric models used in the literature. This work represents a fundamental step in the development of econometric methods for partial differential equations in spatial economics.</description>

      <title>Why to DAO: a narrative analysis of the drivers of tokenized Exit to Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper asks why startups in the blockchain industry are exiting to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), an outstanding phenomena in the wider digital economy which has tended to retain centralized ownership and governance rights of many platforms, products and protocols. Drawing on a narrative analysis of three case studies, I find three possible drivers: (1) exit to DAO is motivated by both financial and stewardship goals which it simultaneously promises to realize via the issuance of tokens; (2) exit to DAO adds an additional layer of ownership and governance rights via tokens, without requiring existing rights to be relinquished, thus making it a lucrative strategy; and (3) markets, laws and social norms underpinning the broader environment in which exits to DAO occur, seem to play an important role in driving the decision. This paper contributes to the academic literature by situating DAOs as a hybrid (and perhaps incomplete) entrepreneurial exit strategy and identifying plausible drivers of the phenomenon which warrant further dedicated research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Blockchain Trilemma: A Comparative Analysis of Algorand, Ethereum 2.0, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology is essential for the digital economy and metaverse, supporting applications from decentralized finance to virtual assets. However, its potential is constrained by the "Blockchain Trilemma," which necessitates balancing decentralization, security, and scalability. This study evaluates and compares two leading proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, Algorand and Ethereum 2.0, against these critical metrics. Our research interprets existing indices to measure decentralization, evaluates scalability through transactional data, and assesses security by identifying potential vulnerabilities. Utilizing real-world data, we analyze each platform's strategies in a structured manner to understand their effectiveness in addressing trilemma challenges. The findings highlight each platform's strengths and propose general methodologies for evaluating key blockchain characteristics applicable to other systems. This research advances the understanding of blockchain technologies and their implications for the future digital economy. Data and code are available on GitHub as open source.</description>

      <title>As Generative Models Improve, People Adapt Their Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an online experiment with N = 1891 participants, we collected and analyzed over 18,000 prompts to explore how the importance of prompting will change as the capabilities of generative AI models continue to improve. Each participant in our experiment was randomly and blindly assigned to use one of three text-to-image diffusion models: DALL-E 2, its more advanced successor DALL-E 3, or a version of DALL-E 3 with automatic prompt revision. Participants were then asked to write prompts to reproduce a target image as closely as possible in 10 consecutive tries. We find that task performance was higher for participants using DALL-E 3 than for those using DALL-E 2. This performance gap corresponds to a noticeable difference in the similarity of participants' images to their target images, and was caused in equal measure by: (1) the increased technical capabilities of DALL-E 3, and (2) endogenous changes in participants' prompting in response to these increased capabilities. More specifically, despite being blind to the model they were assigned, participants assigned to DALL-E 3 wrote longer prompts that were more semantically similar to each other and contained a greater number of descriptive words. Furthermore, while participants assigned to DALL-E 3 with prompt revision still outperformed those assigned to DALL-E 2, automatic prompt revision reduced the benefits of using DALL-E 3 by 58%. Taken together, our results suggest that as models continue to progress, people will continue to adapt their prompts to take advantage of new models' capabilities.</description>

      <title>Data Analysis of Decision Support for Sustainable Welfare in The Presence of GDP Threshold Effects: A Case Study of Interactive Data Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy usage and GDP have been the subject of numerous studies over the past decades. It has been overlooked by previous studies that energy consumption correlates with economic growth in relation to GDP. This study uses threshold regression and Granger causality testing to identify GDP-dependent causality in ten OECD countries over the last 10 years. There is a significant correlation between economic growth and energy consumption. Energy consumption and short-term economic growth are statistically significantly correlated. There is a significant positive effect of energy consumption (EC) on GDP in the short run below the threshold of $10,936 USD since the coefficient is 3.34 and the p-value is 0.0252. There is a -0.0127-correlation coefficient and a 0.0327 p-value associated with GDP Granger-cause EC over the long run. EC and GDP are not causally related for GDP per capita above $10,936 USD. In the long run, GDP Granger causes EC with a coefficient of -0.1638 and a p-value of 0.0675. According to the study, sustainable development requires sustainable use of natural resources, technological investment, foreign direct investment, and gross fixed capital formation. Economic growth can be boosted while adhering to sustainability goals by implementing these recommendations.</description>
