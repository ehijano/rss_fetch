      <title>Denoising study of Fluoroscopic Images in real time tumor tracking System based on Statistical model of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the noise characteristics of intraoperative X-ray fluoroscopic images acquired during real-time image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and presents a novel noise image generation method based on the identified noise amplitude and spatial probability patterns. Initially, noise-free digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) were generated using patient CT data combined with projection algorithms and the spatial configuration of the real-time tumor tracking system. Based on the observed noise probability and amplitude distributions, noise was then added to these DRRs to create Dataset 1. As a control, Dataset 2 was generated by adding Gaussian noise with the same mean and variance as Dataset 1; however, the noise probability in Dataset 2 is independent of pixel location and pixel intensity. Both datasets were used to fine-tune a pre-trained SwinIR model with identical training parameters. Tests on phantom images containing real noise show that the SwinIR model trained with the proposed noise model dataset achieves superior denoising performance over the model trained with Gaussian noise and the model without transfer learning, with an average PSNR improvement of 1.45 dB. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of noise patterns in these fluoroscopic images and is crucial for enhancing image quality and the accuracy of real-time tumor tracking in radiotherapy.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Normative Trajectories of Lifespan Brain Maturation Using Quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Brain maturation and aging involve significant microstructural changes, resulting in functional and cognitive alterations. Quantitative MRI (qMRI) can measure this evolution, distinguishing the physiological effects of normal aging from pathological deviations.
  Methods: We conducted a multicentre study using qMRI metrics (R1, R2*, and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping) to model age trajectories across brain structures, including tractography-based white matter bundles (TWMB), superficial white matter (SWM), and cortical grey matter (CGM). MRI data from 537 healthy subjects, aged 8 to 79 years, were harmonized using two independent methods. We modeled age trajectories and performed regional analyses to capture maturation patterns and aging effects across the lifespan.
  Findings: Our findings revealed a distinct brain maturation gradient, with early qMRI peak values in TWMB, followed by SWM, and culminating in CGM regions. This gradient was observed as a posterior-to-anterior maturation pattern in the cortex and an inferior-to-superior maturation pattern in white matter tracts. R1 demonstrated the most robust age trajectories, while R2* and susceptibility exhibited greater variability and different patterns. The normative modeling framework confirmed the reliability of our age-modelled trajectories across datasets.
  Interpretation: Our study highlights the potential of multiparametric qMRI to capture complex, region-specific brain development patterns, addressing the need for comprehensive, age-spanning studies across multiple brain structures. Various harmonization strategies can merge qMRI cohorts, improving the robustness of qMRI-based age models and facilitating the understanding of normal patterns and disease-associated deviations.</description>

      <title>A Method for Imaging the Ischemic Penumbra with MRI using IVIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the hypothesis that intravoxel incoherent motion MRI (IVIM) can quantify local cerebral blood flow (qCBF), infarct volume, and define the ischemic penumbra for determination of the perfusion-diffusion mismatch (PWI/DWI) volume in a setting of acute ischemic stroke. Eight experiments were conducted in a pre-clinical middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model. IVIM and dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) imaging were acquired 2.5hr post-MCAO. IVIM was post-processed using software written in-house to produce parametric images of local qCBF, Water Transport Time (WTT), diffusion, and subsequently, PWI/DWI mismatch. These IVIM image parameters were compared with delay-and-dispersion-corrected local-AIF DSC perfusion image parameters including Tmax, qCBF, mean transit time (MTT), and mean diffusivity for DSC PWI/DWI mismatch. Final infarct volume was measured 4hrs post-occlusion. Early (2.5hr post-occlusion) DSC qCBF and IVIM qCBF in the diffusion negative MCA territory correlated strongly (slope=1.00, p=0.01,R2=0.69,Lins CCC=0.71), and both DSC and IVIM qCBF values negatively correlated with final infarct volume (R2=0.78,R2=0.61 respectively). The volume of hypoperfusion measured at 2.5 hours from DSC qCBF and from IVIM qCBF both predicted final infarct volume with good sensitivity and correlation (slope=2.08, R2=0.67, slope=2.50,R2=0.68 respectively). IVIM PWI/DWI ratio was correlated with infarct growth (R2=0.70) and WTT correlated with MTT (slope=0.82,R2=0.60). IVIM qCBF correlated strongly with local-AIF DSC qCBF and IVIM PWI/DWI correlated strongly with infarct growth. Both DSC and IVIM quantitative perfusion image acquired early after occlusion were able to predict final infarct volume, and IVIM simultaneous PWI/DWI ratio predicted infarct growth.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Cardiac Digital Twin from surface ECGs: Insights into Identifiability of Ventricular Conduction System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology are an enabling technology for precision cardiology. Current forward models are advanced enough to simulate the cardiac electric activity under different pathophysiological conditions and accurately replicate clinical signals like torso electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this work, we address the challenge of matching subject-specific QRS complexes using anatomically accurate, physiologically grounded cardiac digital twins. By fitting the initial conditions of a cardiac propagation model, our non-invasive method predicts activation patterns during sinus rhythm. For the first time, we demonstrate that distinct activation maps can generate identical surface ECGs. To address this non-uniqueness, we introduce a physiological prior based on the distribution of Purkinje-muscle junctions. Additionally, we develop a digital twin ensemble for probabilistic inference of cardiac activation. Our approach marks a significant advancement in the calibration of cardiac digital twins and enhances their credibility for clinical application.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based auto-contouring of organs/structures-at-risk for pediatric upper abdominal radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purposes: This study aimed to develop a computed tomography (CT)-based multi-organ segmentation model for delineating organs-at-risk (OARs) in pediatric upper abdominal tumors and evaluate its robustness across multiple datasets. Materials and methods: In-house postoperative CTs from pediatric patients with renal tumors and neuroblastoma (n=189) and a public dataset (n=189) with CTs covering thoracoabdominal regions were used. Seventeen OARs were delineated: nine by clinicians (Type 1) and eight using TotalSegmentator (Type 2). Auto-segmentation models were trained using in-house (ModelPMC-UMCU) and a combined dataset of public data (Model-Combined). Performance was assessed with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and mean surface distance (MSD). Two clinicians rated clinical acceptability on a 5-point Likert scale across 15 patient contours. Model robustness was evaluated against sex, age, intravenous contrast, and tumor type. Results: Model-PMC-UMCU achieved mean DSC values above 0.95 for five of nine OARs, while spleen and heart ranged between 0.90 and 0.95. The stomach-bowel and pancreas exhibited DSC values below 0.90. Model-Combined demonstrated improved robustness across both datasets. Clinical evaluation revealed good usability, with both clinicians rating six of nine Type 1 OARs above four and six of eight Type 2 OARs above three. Significant performance 2 differences were only found across age groups in both datasets, specifically in the left lung and pancreas. The 0-2 age group showed the lowest performance. Conclusion: A multi-organ segmentation model was developed, showcasing enhanced robustness when trained on combined datasets. This model is suitable for various OARs and can be applied to multiple datasets in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>RAIDER: Rapid, anatomy-independent, deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using magnitude-only signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: There has been substantial recent interest in magnitude-based fitting methods for estimating proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and R2* from chemical shift-encoded MRI data, since these methods can still be used when complex-based methods fail or when phase data are inaccessible or unreliable, and may also be used as a final processing step with complex-based methods. However, conventional fitting techniques are computationally expensive. Deep learning (DL)-based methods promise to accelerate parameter estimation, but previous attempts have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are limited by training requirements and poor generalizability (anatomy-dependence). To address these limitations, we propose RAIDER, a voxelwise method for rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based PDFF and R2* estimation using multi-echo magnitude-data. Theory and Methods: RAIDER uses two multilayer perceptrons, each trained separately with simulated single-voxel multi-echo magnitude signals, to estimate PDFF and R2*. The use of two networks, each with restricted training distribution, solves the problem of degeneracy during training. During inference, the solution from one of the two networks is chosen based on likelihood. Performance and speed are investigated in a series of simulation experiments, in phantoms and in vivo. Results: RAIDER is 285-1450 times faster than conventional magnitude fitting, taking 1.4-2.3s per slice rather than 8-56minutes, and offers performance similar to conventional fitting. It produces accurate PDFF measurements in phantoms and in vivo images with different anatomies, despite having been trained only on simulation data. Conclusion: RAIDER can substantially accelerate magnitude-based PDFF and R2* estimation, whilst avoiding intrinsic limitations of CNN-based methods.</description>

      <title>Patient-Specific CBCT Synthesis for Real-time Tumor Tracking in Surface-guided Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new imaging system to support real-time tumor tracking for surface-guided radiotherapy (SGRT). SGRT uses optical surface imaging (OSI) to acquire real-time surface topography images of the patient on the treatment couch. However, OSI cannot visualize internal anatomy. This study proposes an Advanced Surface Imaging (A-SI) framework to address this issue. In the proposed A-SI framework, a high-speed surface imaging camera consistently captures surface images during radiation delivery, and a CBCT imager captures single-angle X-ray projections at low frequency. The A-SI then utilizes a generative model to generate real-time volumetric images with full anatomy, referred to as Optical Surface-Derived cone beam computed tomography (OSD-CBCT), based on the real-time high-frequent surface images and the low-frequency collected single-angle X-ray projections. The generated OSD-CBCT can provide accurate tumor motion for precise radiation delivery. The A-SI framework uses a patient-specific generative model: physics-integrated consistency-refinement denoising diffusion probabilistic model (PC-DDPM). This model leverages patient-specific anatomical structures and respiratory motion patterns derived from four-dimensional CT (4DCT) during treatment planning. It then employs a geometric transformation module (GTM) to extract volumetric anatomy information from the single-angle X-ray projection. A simulation study with 22 lung cancer patients evaluated the A-SI framework supported by PC-DDPM. The results showed that the framework produced real-time OSD-CBCT with high reconstruction fidelity and precise tumor localization. This study demonstrates the potential of A-SI to enable real-time tumor tracking with minimal imaging dose, advancing SGRT for motion-associated cancers and interventional procedures.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and lithium-responsive headaches. They have recently gathered attention due to their potential preventive effect in viral infections. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity.
  The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability. This review investigates how lithium ions affect lipid membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. Ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>
