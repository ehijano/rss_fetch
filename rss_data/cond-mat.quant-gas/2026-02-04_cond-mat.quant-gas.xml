      <title>Tuning interactions between static-field-shielded polar molecules with microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to tune interparticle interactions is one of the main advantages of using ultracold quantum gases for quantum simulation of many-body physics. Current experiments with ultracold polar molecules employ shielding with microwave or static electric fields to prevent destructive collisional losses. The interaction potential of microwave-shielded molecules can be tuned by using microwaves of two different polarisations, while for static-field-shielded molecules the tunability of interactions is more limited and depends on the particular species. In this work, we propose a general method to tune the interactions between static-field-shielded molecules by applying a microwave field. We carry out coupled-channel scattering calculations in a field-dressed basis set to determine loss rate coefficients and scattering lengths. We find that both the s-wave scattering length and the dipole length can be widely tuned by changing the parameters of the microwave field, while maintaining strong suppression of lossy collisions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic similarity of vortex shedding in a superfluid flowing past a penetrable obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate wake dynamics in a superfluid flowing past a penetrable obstacle. Unlike an impenetrable object, a penetrable obstacle does not fully deplete the density. We define an effective diameter D_eff from the Mach-1 contour of the time-averaged irrotational flow around the obstacle, which delineates the local supersonic region where quantized vortices nucleate. Using this flow-defined length scale, we construct a superfluid Reynolds number Re_s = (v0 minus vc) times D_eff divided by (hbar over m), where v0 is the flow speed, vc is the critical velocity, and m is the particle mass. We show that Re_s organizes the wake dynamics across obstacle sizes and strengths: the transition from dipole-row emission to alternating vortex cluster shedding occurs at Re_s around 2, and both the Strouhal number and the drag coefficient collapse onto universal curves when plotted as functions of Re_s. These results extend the concept of dynamic similarity in superfluid flows to penetrable obstacles and demonstrate that the dynamically relevant length scale is determined by the supersonic region rather than by the geometric obstacle size.</description>

      <title>Emergence of magnetic excitations in one-dimensional quantum mixtures under confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an exact solution for the spectral function for one-dimensional Bose-Bose and Fermi- Fermi mixtures with strong repulsive interactions, valid in arbitrary confining potentials and at all frequency scales. For the case of harmonic confinement we show that, on top of the ladder structure of the density excitations imposed by the external confinement, spin excitations emerge as sideband peaks, with dispersion related to the one of ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic spin chains and a width fundamentally larger for fermionic mixtures than for bosonic ones, as determined by the different symmetry of spin excited states. The observation of spin excitation branches can provide a univocal probe of interaction-induced magnetism in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Structures and proximity effects of inhomogeneous population-imbalanced Fermi gases with pairing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing spatially varying profiles of pairing interaction or spin polarization to quasi one-dimensional two-component atomic Fermi gases confined in box potentials, we analyze the ground state structures and properties when multiple phases coexist in real space by implementing the Bogoliubov--de~Gennes equation suitable for describing inhomogeneous fermion systems. While the BCS, Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO), and normal phases occupy different regions on the phase diagram when the parameters are uniform, a spatial change of pairing strength or spin polarization can drive the system from the FFLO phase to a normal gas or from a BCS superfluid to the FFLO phase in real space. The FFLO phase exhibits its signature modulating order parameter at the FFLO momentum due to population imbalance, and the pair correlation penetrates the polarized normal phase and exhibits proximity effects. Meanwhile, the BCS phase tends to repel population imbalance and maintain a plateau of pairing. Interestingly, a buffer FFLO phase emerges when the spatial change attempts to join the BCS and normal phase in the presence of spin polarization. By analyzing the pairing correlations, interfacial properties, and momentum-space spectra of the inhomogeneous structures, relevant length- and momentum- scales and their interplay are characterized. We also briefly discuss implications of inhomogeneous multi-phase atomic Fermi gases with population imbalance.</description>

      <title>Temperature driven false vacuum decay in coherently coupled Bose superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relaxation of a quantum field from a metastable state (false vacuum) to a stable one (true vacuum), also known as false vacuum decay, is a fundamental problem in quantum field theory and cosmology. We study this phenomenon using a two-dimensional interacting and coherently coupled Bose-Bose mixture, a platform that has already been employed experimentally to investigate false vacuum decay in one dimension. In such a mixture, it is possible to define an effective magnetization that acts as a quantum field variable. Using the Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SGPE), we prepare thermal equilibrium states in the false vacuum and extract decay rates from the magnetization dynamics. The decay rates show an exponential dependence on temperature, in line with the thermal theory of instantons. Since the SGPE is based on complex scalar fields, it also allows us to explore the behavior of the phase, which turns out to become dynamic during decay. Our results confirm the SGPE as an effective tool for studying coupled magnetization and phase dynamics and the associated instanton physics in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered fidelity revivals in the PXP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the PXP model when subjected to a periodic drive, and unveil the mechanism through which the interplay between spectral properties and initial states governs the emergence of dynamical revivals and their evolution across the space of driving parameters. For N\'eel-ordered initial states, revivals follow well-defined trajectories in the parameter space of the driving, primarily determined by a dominant quasi-energy spacing in the Floquet spectrum. Initial states interpolating between N\'eel and fully polarized configurations exhibit hybrid dynamics, which can be controlled by tuning their overlap with Floquet eigenstates via the driving parameters. This control also allows steering different routes for avoiding Floquet thermalization, showing how both initial state choice and driving protocol shape long-lived dynamics in this driven quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Spin and Charge Conductivity in the Square Lattice Fermi-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical properties are notoriously difficult to compute in numerical treatments of the Fermi-Hubbard model, especially in two spatial dimensions. However, they are essential in providing us with insight into some of the most important and less well-understood phases of the model, such as the pseudogap and strange metal phases at relatively high temperatures, or unconventional superconductivity at lower temperatures, away from the commensurate filling. Here, we use the numerical linked-cluster expansions to compute spin and charge optical conductivities of the model at different temperatures and strong interaction strengths via the exact real-time-dependent correlation functions of the current operators. We mitigate systematic errors associated with having a limited access to the long-time behavior of the correlators by introducing fits and allowing for non-zero Drude weights when appropriate. We compare our results to available data from optical lattice experiments and find that the Drude contributions can account for the theory-experiment gap in the DC spin conductivity of the model at half filling in the strong-coupling region. Our method helps paint a more complete picture of the conductivity in the two-dimensional Hubbard model and opens the door to studying dynamical properties of quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Evaporative damping in open system theory of Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a new damping mechanism in the open quantum systems description of Bose-Einstein condensates. It stems from previously neglected terms in the derivation of the stochastic projective Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE), accounting for a nonlinear evaporation of particles from the coherent into the incoherent region. We demonstrate that the mechanism, while so far assumed to be of minor importance, is comparable in strength to the widely employed number damping. We also provide a simplified (pseudo)-local and a dimensionally reduced form of this evaporative damping. The process completes the SPGPE description of ultracold Bose gases giving a full first-principles picture of their evolution at finite temperature.</description>
