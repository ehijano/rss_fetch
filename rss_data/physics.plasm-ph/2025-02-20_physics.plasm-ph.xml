      <title>Preventing ash from poisoning proton-boron 11 fusion plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-Boron 11 (pB11) fusion is safe and clean, but also difficult to harness for breakeven power production. Particularly deleterious are fusion-born alpha particles, which massively increase both plasma pressure and bremsstrahlung losses unless they are pulled promptly from the plasma. We show that even if one cannot extract the alphas quickly, one can still achieve net power production, by separating the plasma into two regions: a fusion region, accessible to all species, and an alpha storage region, accessible only to alphas and electrons. This new demixing strategy could make pB11 fusion much easier to achieve.</description>

      <title>Neutral particle analyzer for plasma diagnostics on tokamak ST40</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a detailed description of a neutral particle analyzer designed and produced for plasma diagnostics on the spherical tokamak ST40. The aim of the diagnostic is to measure both the bulk ion temperature in the range from 0.5 to 10 keV and the energy distribution of fast ions with energies up to 40 keV, which appear in the plasma through neutral beam injection. A feature of the analyzer is its ability to separate hydrogen isotopes (protium and deuterium) and measure the ion distribution function of the selected isotope.</description>

      <title>Power dependence of density limit due to plasma-wall interaction in a burning plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density limit is one of the major obstacles to achieving the desired fusion performance in tokamaks. However, the underlying physics mechanism for its recently observed power dependence in experiments has not been well understood or predicted in theory. In this work, the power dependent scalings of density limit are obtained based on the plasma-wall self-organization model [D.F. Escande 2022 NF], which are able to match the power dependence of density limits in multiple tokamak devices. The key factors influencing the power dependence are found to be the plasma-wall sputtering and the particle confinement time. The effects of non-sputtered impurities and fusion products are further evaluated. This PWSO-density limit model is then extended to the burning plasma regime and used to predict the conditions for entering burning plasma.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Leaky Surface Plasmon Accelerator in Nanostructured Carbon Nanotube Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum-degenerate metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the conduction electron gas forms a solid-state plasma environment where collective dynamics are dominant. This dense plasma is capable of supporting the excitation of surface plasmon on the CNT surface. In this study, we demonstrate a new class of microscale relativistic surface plasmons (RSPs) that, independent of laser polarisation and matching medium, can be directly excited by paraxial propagation of a high-intensity optical laser pulse through a cylindrical vacuum channel nanostructured in a CNT forest. The leaky field of the resonant RSP mode can support a non-evanescent longitudinal component with amplitude up to several TV/m-levels and a phase-matched focusing field. This field enables the sustained acceleration of relativistic electrons and positrons over long distances. We also investigate two possible mechanisms for electron injection, including edge injection and self-injection, both of which are feasible with current laser facilities, paving the way for experimental realisation. As well as highlighting a promising avenue for the development of ultra-compact, high-energy solid-state plasma particle accelerators, this work also opens up the potential for high-energy plasmonics.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the inner heliosphere, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Propagation of waves in weakly ionized two-fluid plasmas. I. Small-amplitude Alfv\'enic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large abundance of electrically neutral particles has a remarkable impact on the dynamics of many astrophysical plasmas. Here, we use a two-fluid model that includes charge-neutral elastic collisions and Hall's current to study the propagation of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in weakly ionized plasmas. we derive the dispersion relation for small-amplitude incompressible transverse waves propagating along the background magnetic field. Then, we focus on the polarization relations fulfilled by the eigenmodes and their corresponding ratios of magnetic to kinetic energies, and we study their dependence on the relations between the oscillation, collision and cyclotron frequencies. For low wave frequencies, the two components of the plasma are strongly coupled, the damping due to the charge-neutral interaction is weak and the effect of Hall's term is negligible. However, as the wave frequency increases, phase shifts between the velocity of charges, the velocity of neutrals, and the magnetic field appear, leading to enhanced damping. The effect of collisions on the propagation of waves strongly depends on their polarization state, with the left-handed circularly polarized ion-cyclotron modes being more efficiently damped than the linearly polarized Alfv\'en waves and the right-handed circularly polarized whistler modes. Moreover, the equipartition relation between the magnetic energy and the kinetic energy of Alfv\'en waves does not hold in general when the collisional interaction and Hall's current are taken into account, with the magnetic energy usually dominating over the kinetic energy. This theoretical result extends previous findings from observational and numerical works about turbulence in astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nonresonant quantum dynamics of a relativistic electron in counterpropagating laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of an ultrarelativistic electron in strong counterpropagating laser beams is investigated. In contrast to the stimulated Compton scattering regime, we consider the case when in the electron rest frame the frequency of the counterpropagating wave greatly exceeds that of the copropagating one. Taking advantage of the corresponding approximation recently developed by the authors for treating the classical dynamics in this setup, we solve the Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations in the quasiclassical approximation in the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) framework. The obtained wave function for the Dirac equation shows entanglement between the kinetic momentum and spin of the electron, while the spin-averaged momentum coincides with the classical counterpart as expected. The derived wave functions will enable the calculation of the probabilities of nonlinear QED processes in this counterpropagating fields configuration.</description>

      <title>A Fully Three-Dimensional Kinetic Particle-In-Cell Framework for Modeling Laser-Dielectric Interactions: Few-Cycle Pulse Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully three-dimensional kinetic framework for modeling intense short pulse lasers interacting with dielectric materials. Our work modifies the open-source Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code EPOCH to include new models for molecular photoionization and dielectric optical response. We use this framework to model the laser-induced damage of dielectric materials by few-cycle laser pulses. The framework is benchmarked against experimental results for bulk silica targets and then applied to model multi-layer dielectric mirrors with a sequence of simulations with varying laser fluence. This allows us to better understand the laser damage process by providing new insight into energy absorption, excited particle dynamics, and nonthermal excited particle dist</description>

      <title>Polytropic Behavior in Corotating Interaction Regions: Evidence of Alfv\'enic Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) are recurring structures in the solar wind, characterized by interactions between fast and slow solar wind streams that compress and heat plasma. This study investigates the polytropic behavior of distinct regions in and around CIRs: uncompressed slow solar wind, compressed slow solar wind, compressed fast solar wind, and uncompressed fast solar wind. Using Wind spacecraft data and an established methodology for calculating the polytropic index ({\gamma}), we analyze 117 CIR events. Results indicate varying {\gamma} values across regions, with heating observed in compressed regions driven by Alfv\'en wave dissipation originating from fast streams. In the uncompressed fast solar wind, {\gamma} exceeds adiabatic values the most and correlates well with strong Alfv\'enic wave activity.</description>

      <title>Experiments and modeling of dust particle heating resulting from changes in polarity switching in the PK-4 microgravity laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of gravity, the micron-sized charged dust particles in a complex (dusty) plasma are compressed into thin layers. However, under the microgravity conditions of the Plasma Kristall-4 (PK-4) experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), the particles fill the plasma, allowing us to investigate the properties of a three-dimensional (3D) multi-particle system. This paper examines the change in the spatial ordering and thermal state of the particle system created when dust particles are stopped by periodic oscillations of the electric field, known as polarity switching, in a dc glow discharge plasma.
  Data from the ISS is compared against experiments performed using a ground-based reference version of PK-4 and numerical simulations. Initial results show substantive differences in the velocity distribution functions between experiments on the ground and in microgravity. There are also differences in the motion of the dust cloud, in microgravity there is an expansion of the dust cloud at the application of polarity switching which is not seen in the ground-based experiments. It is proposed that the dust cloud in microgravity gains thermal energy at the application of polarity switching due to this expansion. Simulation results suggest that this may be due to a modification in the effective screening length of the dust at the onset of polarity switching, which arises from a configuration energy between the charged particles. Experimental measurements and simulations show that an extended time (much greater than the Epstein drag decay) is required to dissipate this energy.</description>
