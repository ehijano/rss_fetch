      <title>Development of convective envelopes in massive stars: Implications for gravitational wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of stellar envelopes strongly influences the course and outcome of binary mass transfer, in particular of common envelope (CE) evolution. Convective envelopes can most easily be ejected during CE events, leading to short-period binaries and potentially gravitational wave (GW) sources. Conversely, radiative envelope are thought to lead to CE mergers and Thorne-Zytkow objects (TZOs) or quasi-stars (QS). Rapid binary models based on Hurley et al. (2000) often assume that any CE event with a Hertzsprung gap donor results in a CE merger, in tension with literature. We improve this with a more self-consistent criterion based on the presence of a convective envelope. Using 1D stellar models (MESA), we systematically investigate the development of convective envelopes in massive stars. We provide fitting formulae for rapid binary codes and implement them into the StarTrack population synthesis code to refine the CE treatment and examine the impact on GW sources, TZOs, and QSs. We show that convective envelopes in massive stars are highly sensitive to the treatment of superadiabacity and the mixing length. Our revised CE model significantly reduces (factor 20) the predicted merger rate of binary black hole (BH-BH) mergers with total masses between roughly 20 and 50 Msun. This leads to a bimodal mass distribution with a strong metallicity dependence. We also predict that the current TZO/QS formation rate in the Galaxy (up to roughly 10-4 yr-1), combined with their predicted lifetimes, makes their detection unlikely. Our study strongly suggests that the role of CE evolution in the formation of BH-BH mergers has been considerably overestimated for BH-BH mergers with Mtot &gt; 20 Msun. We highlight that any prediction from the CE channel for massive BH-BH mergers (&gt;50 Msun) heavily hinges on our limited understanding of stellar structure and mass loss close to the Eddington limit.</description>

      <title>Using the Ca II lines in T Tauri stars to infer the abundance of refractory elements in the innermost disk regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the abundance of calcium in the innermost disk of 70 T Tauri stars in the star-forming regions of Chamaeleon I, Lupus and Orion OB1b. We use calcium as a proxy for the refractory material that reaches the inner disk. We used magnetospheric accretion models to analyze the Ca II emission lines and estimate abundances in the accretion flows of the stars, which feed from the inner disks. We find Ca depletion in disks of all three star-forming regions, with 57% of the sample having [Ca/H] &lt; -0.30 relative to the solar abundance. All disks with cavities and/or substructures show depletion, consistent with trapping of refractories in pressure bumps. Significant Ca depletion ([Ca/H] &lt; -0.30) is also measured in 60% of full disks, although some of those disks may have hidden substructures or cavities. We find no correlation between Ca abundance and stellar or disk parameters except for the mass accretion rate onto the star. This could suggest that the inner and outer disks are decoupled, and that the mass accretion rate is related to a mass reservoir in the inner disk, while refractory depletion reflects phenomena in the outer disk related to the presence of structure and forming planets. Our results of refractory depletion and timescales for depletion are qualitatively consistent with expectations of dust growth and radial drift including partitioning of elements and constitute direct evidence that radial drift of solids locked in pebbles takes place in disks.</description>

      <title>Further study of starspot activity and measurement of differential rotation for SZ Piscium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of 9 Doppler images of the magnetically active K component of the RS CVn-type binary SZ Psc, based on the high-resolution spectroscopic data collected from 2014 to 2018. We apply least-squares deconvolution to all spectra to extract the average profiles with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for Doppler imaging. The surface maps of the K subgiant show starspots widely distributed along latitude and longitude. A prominent, non-axisymmetric polar spot around phase 0 is revealed by all images with sufficient phase coverage, which may be a stable feature on the K component. The starspots evolve in a time scale of one month. We have determined the surface shear rate of the K component from the starspot maps reconstructed 10 days apart in 2017 Nov--Dec, through the cross-correlation method. The surface differential rotation parameters are $\Omega_{eq} = 1.591 \pm 0.002$ rad d$^{-1}$ and $\Delta \Omega = 0.035 \pm 0.003$ rad d$^{-1}$. The absorption lines contributed from the tertiary component are detected in all LSD profiles of SZ Psc, and we measure the radial velocity of the binary system and the tertiary component to derive an elliptical orbit with a period of $1530 \pm 3$ days and a mass of $0.75 \pm 0.06$ M$\odot$ for the tertiary component.</description>

      <title>HIP 8522: A Puzzling Young Solar Twin with the Lowest Detected Lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HIP 8522, a young solar twin with the lowest detected lithium, potentially a field blue straggler or the result of episodic early accretion. Its stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff} = 5729 \pm 7$ K, $\log g = 4.532 \pm 0.016$ dex, $\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.005 \pm 0.010$ dex, $v_{t} = 1.08 \pm 0.02$ km s$^{-1}$) and chemical composition were determined via spectroscopic equilibrium using high resolution spectra ($R = 60~000-165~000$). The age of HIP 8522 was estimated to be an upper limit of $&lt;$1 Gyr through isochrone fitting and was further confirmed using chemical clocks. Spectral synthesis of the lithium line at $\sim$6707.8 \AA\ yielded an upper lithium abundance limit of $A(\rm{Li}) &lt;$ 0.8 dex. This value is unusually low for solar twins of similar age, which typically have $A(\rm{Li})$ values ranging from 2.0 to 3.3 dex, suggesting that $\sim$2 dex of lithium is missing. We investigate various scenarios, such as planet engulfment, sub-stellar mergers, and extra mixing. However, two distinct hypotheses provide plausible explanations for the significant depletion of lithium: one suggests that HIP 8522 is a field blue straggler formed by the merger of a close binary, while the other proposes that HIP 8522 experienced early episodic accretion. The young solar twin HIP 8522 presents an exceptional opportunity to rigorously test stellar evolution models and gain crucial insights into the internal mixing mechanisms responsible for the significant destruction of lithium.</description>

      <title>Can Neutron Star Mergers Alone Explain the R-process Enrichment of the Milky Way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mennekens and Vanbeveren (2014) studied the effect of double compact star mergers on the Galactic chemical enrichment of r-process elements. LIGO merger detections since 2015 and new r-process element yields as function of neutron star + neutron star and neutron star + black hole mass requires an update of the 2014 computations. The results of the update are the scope of the present paper.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic study of late-type emission-line stars using the data from LAMOST DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-mass emission-line stars belong to various evolutionary stages, from pre-main-sequence young stars to evolved stars. In this work, we present a catalog of late-type (F0 to M9) emission-line stars from the LAMOST Data Release 6. Using the scipy package, we created a Python code that finds the emission peak at H-alpha in all late-type stellar spectra. A dataset of 38,152 late-type emission-line stars was obtained after a rigorous examination of the photometric quality flags and the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra. Adopting well-known photometric and spectroscopic methods, we classified our sample into 438 infrared excess sources, 4,669 post-main-sequence candidates, 9,718 Fe/Ge/Ke sources, and 23,264 dMe sources. From a cross-match with known databases, we found that 29,222 sources, comprising 65 IR excess sources, 7,899 Fe/Ge/Ke stars, 17,533 dMe stars, and 3,725 PtMS candidates, are new detections. We measured the equivalent width of the major emission lines observed in the spectra of our sample of emission-line stars. Furthermore, the trend observed in the line strengths of major emission lines over the entire late-type spectral range is analyzed. We further classified the sample into 4 groups based on the presence of Hydrogen and Calcium emission lines. This work presents a large dataset of late-type emission-line stars, which can be used to study active phenomena in late-type stars.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Active Region Classification: A Systematic Study from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solar active region can significantly disrupt the Sun Earth space environment, often leading to severe space weather events such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. As a consequence, the automatic classification of active region groups is the crucial starting point for accurately and promptly predicting solar activity. This study presents our results concerned with the application of deep learning techniques to the classification of active region cutouts based on the Mount Wilson classification scheme. Specifically, we have explored the latest advancements in image classification architectures, from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers, and reported on their performances for the active region classification task, showing that the crucial point for their effectiveness consists in a robust training process based on the latest advances in the field.</description>

      <title>Origins of the fastest stars from merger-disruption of He-CO white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypervelocity white dwarfs (HVWDs) are stellar remnants moving at speeds exceeding the Milky Way's escape velocity. The origins of the fastest HVWDs are enigmatic, with proposed formation scenarios facing challenges explaining both their extreme velocities and observed properties. Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid helium-carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.68 and 0.62 M$_\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models. This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Leiptr Stellar Stream: A Disrupted Ultra-faint Dwarf Galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical abundances of stellar streams can be used to determine the nature of a stream's progenitor. Here we study the progenitor of the recently discovered Leiptr stellar stream, which was previously suggested to be a tidally disrupted halo globular cluster. We obtain high-resolution spectra of five red giant branch stars selected from the Gaia DR2 STREAMFINDER catalog with Magellan/MIKE. One star is a clear non-member. The remaining four stars display chemical abundances consistent with those of a low-mass dwarf galaxy: they have a low mean metallicity, $\langle{\rm[Fe/H]}\rangle = -2.2$; they do not all have identical metallicities; and they display low [$\alpha$/Fe] $\sim 0$ and [Sr/Fe] and [Ba/Fe] $\sim -1$. This pattern of low $\alpha$ and neutron-capture element abundances is only found in intact dwarf galaxies with stellar mass $\lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$. Although more data are needed to be certain, Leiptr's chemistry is consistent with being the lowest-mass dwarf galaxy stream without a known intact progenitor, possibly in the mass range of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Leiptr thus preserves a record of one of the lowest-mass early accretion events into the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ II: Hierarchical Structure Analysis of the Central Molecular Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the way station at the heart of our Milky Way Galaxy, connecting gas flowing in from Galactic scales with the central nucleus. Key open questions remain about its 3-D structure, star formation properties, and role in regulating this gas inflow. In this work, we identify a hierarchy of discrete structures in the CMZ using column density and dust temperature maps from Paper I (Battersby et al., submitted). We calculate the physical ($N$(H$_2$), $T_{\rm{dust}}$, mass, radius) and kinematic (HNCO, HCN, and HC$_3$N moments) properties of each structure as well as their bolometric luminosities and star formation rates (SFRs). We compare these properties with regions in the Milky Way disk and external galaxies. We perform power-law fits to the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs) of the inner 100 pc, SgrB2, and the outer 100 pc of the CMZ as well as several individual molecular cloud structures and find generally steeper power-law slopes ($-9&lt;\alpha&lt;-2$) compared with the literature ($-6 &lt; \alpha &lt; -1$). We find that individual CMZ structures require a large external pressure ($P_e$/k$_B$ $&gt; 10^{7-9}$ K cm$^{-3}$) to be considered bound. Despite the fact that the CMZ overall is well below the Gao-Solomon dense gas star-formation relation (and in modest agreement with the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation), individual structures on the scale of molecular clouds generally follow these star-formation relations and agree well with other Milky Way and extragalactic regions.</description>

      <title>3-D CMZ I: Central Molecular Zone Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is the largest reservoir of dense molecular gas in the Galaxy and is heavily obscured in the optical and near-IR. We present an overview of the far-IR dust continuum, where the molecular clouds are revealed, provided by Herschel in the inner 40\deg($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Milky Way with a particular focus on the CMZ. We report a total dense gas ($N$(H$_2$) $&gt; 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$) CMZ mass of M=$2\substack{+2 \\ -1} \times 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ and confirm that there is a highly asymmetric distribution of dense gas, with about 70-75% at positive longitudes. We create and publicly release complete fore/background-subtracted column density and dust temperature maps in the inner 40\deg ($|l| &lt;$ 20\deg) of the Galaxy. We find that the CMZ clearly stands out as a distinct structure, with an average mass per longitude that is at least $3\times$ higher than the rest of the inner Galaxy contiguously from 1.8\deg $&gt; \ell &gt;$ -1.3\deg. This CMZ extent is larger than previously assumed, but is consistent with constraints from velocity information. The inner Galaxy's column density peaks towards the SgrB2 complex with a value of about 2 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, and typical CMZ molecular clouds are about N(H$_2$)=10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. Typical CMZ dust temperatures range from about $12-35$ K with relatively little variation. We identify a ridge of warm dust in the inner CMZ that potentially traces the base of the northern Galactic outflow seen with MEERKAT.</description>

      <title>ATOMS: ALMA three-millimeter observations of massive star-forming regions -- XVIII. On the origin and evolution of dense gas fragments in molecular shells of compact HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragmentation and evolution for the molecular shells of the compact HII regions are less explored compared to their evolved counterparts. We map nine compact HII regions with a typical diameter of 0.4 pc that are surrounded by molecular shells traced by CCH. Several to a dozen dense gas fragments probed by H13CO+ are embedded in these molecular shells. These gas fragments, strongly affected by the HII region, have a higher surface density, mass, and turbulence than those outside the shells but within the same pc-scale natal clump. These features suggest that the shells swept up by the early HII regions can enhance the formation of massive dense structures that may host the birth of higher-mass stars. We examine the formation of fragments and find that fragmentation of the swept-up shell is unlikely to occur in these early HII regions, by comparing the expected time scale of shell fragmentation with the age of HII region. We propose that the appearance of gas fragments in these shells is probably the result of sweeping up pre-existing fragments into the molecular shell that has not yet fragmented. Taken together, this work provides a basis for understanding the interplay of star-forming sites with an intricate environment containing ionization feedback such as those observed in starburst regions.</description>

      <title>Scaling with the Stars: The emergence of marginal stability in low Prandtl number turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To improve models of the structure and evolution of stellar and planetary interiors, it is important to quantify transport by strongly stratified turbulence in low Prandtl number fluids. Recent numerical studies have shown evidence for scale-separated dynamics in strongly anisotropic flows. Motivated by these results, in the first part of this report we perform a multiscale analysis of the governing equations and identify regimes of behaviour. In the second part, we apply algorithms for solving slow-fast quasilinear systems to our reduced-order systems for low Prandtl number fluids and demonstrate their approach to and maintenance of marginal stability. This is a Fellow's Report for the 2022 Program of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer School.</description>

      <title>The Radio-Infrared Nebula in II Zw 40: Clusters Forming in Colliding Elongated Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: II Zw 40 is a starburst dwarf and merger product, and holds a radio-infrared supernebula excited by thousands of embedded OB stars. We present here observations of three aspects of the supernebula: maps of the K and KU radio continuum that trace dense ionized gas with spatial resolution $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$, a spectral data cube of the [S IV]$10.5\mu$m emission line that measures the kinematics of the ionized gas with velocity resolution $4.5$ km s$^{-1}$, and an ALMA spectral cube of the CO(3-2) line that probes the dense warm molecular gas with spatial and velocity resolution comparable to the ionized gas. The observations suggest that the supernebula is the overlap,collision or merger of two star clusters, each associated with an elongated molecular cloud. We accordingly modelled the supernebula with simulations of colliding clusters. The model that best agrees with the data is a grazing collision that has distorted the gas and stars to create the distinctive structures observed. These models may have wide applicability in the cluster-rich regions of young starbursts.</description>

      <title>Linking the primordial composition of planet building disks to the present-day composition of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The composition of rocky planets is strongly driven by the primordial materials in the protoplanetary disk, which can be inferred from the abundances of the host star. Understanding this compositional link is crucial for characterizing exoplanets. We aim to investigate the relationship between the compositions of low-mass planets and their host stars. We determined the primordial compositions of host stars using high-precision present-day stellar abundances and stellar evolutionary models. These primordial abundances were then input into a stoichiometric model to estimate the composition of planet-building blocks. Additionally, we employed a three-component planetary interior model (core, mantle, water in different phases) to estimate planetary compositions based only on their radius and mass. We found that although stellar abundances vary over time, relevant abundance ratios like Fe/Mg remain relatively constant during the main sequence evolution for low temperature stars. A strong correlation is found between the iron-to-silicate mass fraction of protoplanetary disks and planets, while no significant correlation was observed for water mass fractions. The Fe/Mg ratio varies significantly between planets and their stars, indicating substantial disk-driven compositional diversity, and this ratio also correlates with planetary radius. While stellar abundances, as a proxy of the composition of protoplanetary disk, provide a baseline for planetary composition, significant deviations arise due to complex disk processes, challenging the assumption of a direct, one-to-one elemental relationship between stars and their planets.</description>

      <title>LEIA discovery of the longest-lasting and most energetic stellar X-ray flare ever detected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LEIA (Lobster Eye Imager for Astronomy) detected a new X-ray transient on November 7, 2022, identified as a superflare event occurring on a nearby RS CVn-type binary HD 251108. The flux increase was also detected in follow-up observations at X-ray, UV and optical wavelengths. The flare lasted for about 40 days in soft X-ray observations, reaching a peak luminosity of ~1.1 * 10^34 erg/s in 0.5-4.0 keV, which is roughly 60 times the quiescent luminosity. Optical brightening was observed for only one night. The X-ray light curve is well described by a double "FRED" (fast rise and exponential decay) model, attributed to the cooling process of a loop arcade structure formed subsequent to the initial large loop with a half-length of ~1.9 times the radius of the host star. Time-resolved X-ray spectra were fitted with a two-temperature apec model, showing significant evolution of plasma temperature, emission measure, and metal abundance over time. The estimated energy released in the LEIA band is ~3 * 10^39 erg, suggesting this is likely the most energetic X-ray stellar flare with the longest duration detected to date.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Reveals the Nested Morphology of Disk Winds from Young Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radially extended disk winds could be the key to unlocking how protoplanetary disks accrete and how planets form and migrate. A distinctive characteristic is their nested morphology of velocity and chemistry. Here we report JWST/NIRSpec spectro-imaging of four young stars with edge-on disks in the Taurus star-forming region that demonstrate the ubiquity of this structure. In each source, a fast collimated jet traced by [Fe II] is nested inside a hollow cavity within wider lower-velocity H2 and, in one case, also CO ro-vibrational (v=1-0) emission. Furthermore, in one of our sources, ALMA CO(2-1) emission, paired with our NIRSpec images, reveals the nested wind structure extends further outward. This nested wind morphology strongly supports theoretical predictions for wind-driven accretion and underscores the need for theoretical work to assess the role of winds in the formation and evolution of planetary systems</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the sub-stellar boundary, signatures of magnetic fields begin to manifest at radio wavelengths, analogous to the auroral emission of the magnetised solar system planets. This emission provides a singular avenue for measuring magnetic fields at planetary scales in extrasolar systems. So far, exoplanets have eluded detection at radio wavelengths. However, ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), their higher mass counterparts, have been detected for over two decades in the radio. Given their similar characteristics to massive exoplanets, UCDs are ideal targets to bridge our understanding of magnetic field generation from stars to planets. In this work, we develop a new tomographic technique for inverting both the viewing angle and large-scale magnetic field structure of UCDs from observations of coherent radio bursts. We apply our methodology to the nearby T8 dwarf WISE J062309.94-045624.6 (J0623) which was recently detected at radio wavelengths, and show that it is likely viewed pole-on. We also find that J0623's rotation and magnetic axes are misaligned significantly, reminiscent of Uranus and Neptune, and show that it may be undergoing a magnetic cycle with a period exceeding 6 months in duration. These findings demonstrate that our method is a robust new tool for studying magnetic fields on planetary-mass objects. With the advent of next-generation low-frequency radio facilities, the methods presented here could facilitate the characterisation of exoplanetary magnetospheres for the first time.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Advanced Machine Learning-based Approaches for Stellar Flare Identification: Application to TESS short-cadence Data and Analysis of a New Flare Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply multi-algorithm machine learning models to TESS 2-minute survey data from Sectors 1-72 to identify stellar flares. Models trained with Deep Neural Network, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms, respectively, utilized four flare light curve characteristics as input features. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, all exceeding 94%. Validation against previously reported TESS M dwarf flare identifications showed that our models successfully recovered over 92% of the flares while detecting $\sim2,000$ more small events, thus extending the detection sensitivity of previous work. After processing 1.3 million light curves, our models identified nearly 18,000 flare stars and 250,000 flares. We present an extensive catalog documenting both flare and stellar properties. We find strong correlations in total flare energy and flare amplitude with color, in agreement with previous studies. Flare frequency distributions are analyzed, refining power-law slopes for flare behavior with the frequency uncertainties due to the detection incompleteness of low-amplitude events. We determine rotation periods for $\sim120,000$ stars thus yielding the relationship between rotation period and flare activity. We find that the transition in rotation period between the saturated and unsaturated regimes in flare energy coincides with the same transition in rotation period separating the saturated and unsaturated levels in coronal X-ray emission. We find that X-ray emission increases more rapidly with flare luminosity in earlier-type and unsaturated stars, indicating more efficient coronal heating in these objects. Additionally, we detect flares in white dwarfs and hot subdwarfs that are likely arising from unresolved low-mass companions.</description>

      <title>f-mode oscillations of anisotropic neutron stars in full general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate f-mode oscillations of static anisotropic stable neutron stars within the framework of full general relativity. We present equations governing unperturbed stellar structures and oscillations with an ansatz to account for the anisotropy. We solve those equations for two different equations of states. We see that, moderately anisotropic neutron stars with the tangential pressure larger than the radial pressure can give more massive neutron stars than the isotropic or very anisotropic ones. We find that the frequency of the f-mode exhibits a linear relationship with the square root of the average density of the stars and the slope of the fit depends on the anisotropic strength. For any given value of the anisotropic strength, the frequency increases with the increase of the mass of the neutron star, linearly for lower masses, and rapidly at higher masses. However, this non-linear rise in the frequency with the mass is not prominent when the radial pressure is larger than the tangential pressure. For a fixed value of a small mass, higher anisotropy leads to a larger value of the frequency, but when the fixed mass is above a threshold value, higher anisotropy leads to a smaller value of the frequency. The nature of the variation in the frequency with the change in the anisotropic strength is similar for the two equations of state, but for a fixed mass and the same amount of the anisotropy, the softer equations of state gives higher frequency. We also find that the damping time of the f-mode oscillation decreases as the mass of the neutron star increases for all values of the anisotropic strength. For a fixed mass of the neutron star and for the same amount of the anisotropy, the value of the damping time is lower for the softer equation of state, but the nature of the variation in the damping time with the change in the anisotropic strength is similar.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength observations of the Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient AT2023fhn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transients notable for their rapid rise and fade times, blue colour and accompanying luminous X-ray and radio emission. Only a handful have been studied in detail since the prototypical example AT2018cow. Their origins are currently unknown, but ongoing observations of previous and new events are placing ever stronger constraints on their progenitors. We aim to put further constraints on the LFBOT AT2023fhn, and LFBOTs as a class, using information from the multi-wavelength transient light-curve, its host galaxy and local environment. Our primary results are obtained by fitting galaxy models to the spectral energy distribution of AT2023fhn's host and local environment, and by modelling the radio light-curve of AT2023fhn as due to synchrotron self-absorbed emission from an expanding blast-wave in the circumstellar medium. We find that neither the host galaxy nor circumstellar environment of AT2023fhn are unusual compared with previous LFBOTs, but that AT2023fhn has a much lower X-ray to ultraviolet luminosity ratio than previous events. We argue that the variety in ultraviolet-optical to X-ray luminosity ratios among LFBOTs is likely due to viewing angle differences, and that the diffuse, yet young local environment of AT2023fhn - combined with a similar circumstellar medium to previous events - favours a progenitor system containing a massive star with strong winds. Plausible progenitor models in this interpretation therefore include black hole/Wolf-Rayet mergers or failed supernovae.</description>

      <title>Disequilibrium Chemistry, Diabatic Thermal Structure, and Clouds in the Atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Located 10.888 pc from Earth, COCONUTS-2b is a planetary-mass companion to a young (150-800 Myr) M3 star, with a wide orbital separation (6471 au) and a low companion-to-host mass ratio ($0.021\pm0.005$). We have studied the atmospheric properties of COCONUTS-2b using newly acquired 1.0-2.5 $\mu$m spectroscopy from Gemini/Flamingos-2. The spectral type of COCONUTS-2b is refined to T$9.5 \pm 0.5$ based on comparisons with T/Y dwarf spectral templates. We have conducted an extensive forward-modeling analysis, comparing the near-infrared spectrum and mid-infrared broadband photometry with sixteen state-of-the-art atmospheric model grids developed for brown dwarfs and self-luminous exoplanets near the T/Y transition. The PH$_{3}$-free ATMO2020++, ATMO2020++, and Exo-REM models best match the specific observations of COCONUTS-2b, regardless of variations in the input spectrophotometry. This analysis suggests the presence of disequilibrium chemistry, along with a diabatic thermal structure and/or clouds, in the atmosphere of COCONUTS-2b. All models predict fainter $Y$-band fluxes than observed, highlighting uncertainties in the alkali chemistry models and opacities. We determine a bolometric luminosity of $\log{(L_{\rm bol}/L_{\odot})}=-6.18$ dex, with a 0.5 dex-wide range of $[-6.43,-5.93]$ dex that accounts for various assumptions of models. Using thermal evolution models, we derive an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=483^{+44}_{-53}$ K, a surface gravity of $\log{(g)}=4.19^{+0.18}_{-0.13}$ dex, a radius of $R=1.11^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, and a mass of $M=8 \pm 2$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. Various atmospheric model grids consistently indicate that COCONUTS-2b's atmosphere has sub- or near-solar metallicity and C/O. These findings provide valuable insights into COCONUTS-2b's formation history and the potential outward migration to its current wide orbit.</description>
