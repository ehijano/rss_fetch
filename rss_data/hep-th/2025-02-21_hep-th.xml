      <title>One-loop Renormalization of BPS String Masses in Pseudo-anomalous Heterotic String</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compactification of heterotic string on a Calabi-Yau threefold can lead to a four-dimensional low-energy effective theory which contains a $U(1)$ gauge theory which is pseudo-anomalous, meaning that the fermion content is anomalous, but that the fermion anomaly is cancelled by a four-dimensional version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism involving a shift of the model-independent axion field. It is also well known that a field-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos like term is induced at one-loop in string perturbation theory in such compactifications and that this leads to a mass for the $U(1)$ gauge field. Explicit one-loop computations of the mass shifts of massless charged scalars and fermions implied by this mechanism were originally carried out in the 1980's and have been revisited more recently using techniques of string field theory and super Riemann surfaces. We consider such theories further compactified on a circle of radius $R$. There is then an infinite tower of BPS states with winding and momenta on the circle. BPS strings which wind the circle can, at large $R$, be viewed as macroscopic or cosmic strings in four spacetime dimensions, or, at generic $R$, as BPS states in three dimensions. We compute the one-loop mass renormalization of such states and show that it is nonzero and proportional to their pseudo-anomalous $U(1)$ charge.</description>

      <title>A formula for the block expansion in free CFTs and applications to ${\cal N}=4$ SYM at strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An explicit analytic formula is presented that computes the conformal (super-)block decomposition of any free scalar or half-BPS diagram in 1d, 2d or 4d CFTs, with various supersymmetries, including none. We prove our formula by exploiting a connection between conformal blocks and symmetric polynomials. Then we give a direct application of our result to the study of four-point correlators in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM at strong coupling. In particular, we give a CFT proof of the tree-level Witten diagram representation of $\langle {\cal O}_2^2{\cal O}_2^2 {\cal O}_q{\cal O}_q\rangle$ on AdS$_5\times$S$^5$, providing new and highly non-trivial checks of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our method works for a more general class of multi-particle correlators and can be used to bootstrap new results at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Analysis of symmetries in the Causal Loop-Tree Duality representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling hidden symmetries within Feynman diagrams is crucial for achieving more efficient computations in high-energy physics. In this paper, we study the symmetries underlying the causal Loop-Tree Duality (LTD) representations through a geometric analysis. Focusing on the integrand-level representations of $N$-point functions at one loop, we examine their degenerations and discover that different causal representations are interconnected through specific transformations arising from the symmetries of cut diagrams. Furthermore, the degeneration is linked to algebraic constraints among the different causal thresholds. Our findings shed new light on the deeper structures of Feynman integrals and pave the way for significantly accelerating their calculation by interrelating different approaches.</description>

      <title>Giant gravitons in D$p$-brane holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider half BPS operators in maximally supersymmetric Yang Mills (SYM) in $p+1$ dimensions. These operators satisfy trace relations that are identical to those discussed in the $p=3$ case ($\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM). Nevertheless, the bulk explanation of these trace relations must differ from the $p = 3$ case as their holographic duals are not AdS spacetimes. We identify giant graviton solutions in the dual holographic backgrounds for $-1 \le p \le 4$. In the 't Hooft limit, these giants are D$(6-p)$-branes that wrap a $S_{6-p} \subset S_{8-p}$. We also follow the giants into the strong coupling region where they become other branes. Despite propagating in a non-AdS geometry, we find that the branes ``feel'' like they are in AdS. This is closely related to the emergent scaling symmetry present in these boundary theories.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest: their central charges $c=1-6\frac{(p-q)^2}{pq}$ are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values -- the Coxeter numbers of $E_6, E_7, E_8$. The E-series is also the least well understood, with few known results beyond the spectrum.
  Here, we use a semi-analytic bootstrap approach for numerically computing 4-point correlation functions. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. These vanishings can be explained by constraints from null vectors, interchiral symmetry, simple currents, extended symmetries, permutations, and parity, except in one case for $q=30$. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function, times polynomial functions of $\cos(\pi\frac{p}{q})$ with values in $\mathbb{Q}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{q})\big)$, which we work out explicitly for $q=12$.
  We speculate on generalizing E-series minimal models to generic integer values of $q$, and recovering loop CFTs as $p,q\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping SU(3) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the positivity bootstrap approach to SU(3) lattice Yang-Mills (YM) theory, extending previous studies of large N and SU(2) theories by incorporating multiple-trace Wilson loop operators. Utilizing Hermitian and reflection positivity conditions, along with Schwinger-Dyson (SD) loop equations, we compute rigorous bounds for the expectation values of plaquette Wilson loop in 2D, 3D, and 4D YM theories. Our results exhibit clear convergence and are consistent with known analytic or numerical results. To enhance the approach, we introduce a novel twist-reflection positivity condition, which we prove to be exact in the 2D YM theory. Additionally, we propose a dimensional-reduction truncation, where Wilson loop operators are effectively restricted to a lower-dimensional subplane, significantly simplifying the computations. SD equations for double-trace Wilson loops are also derived in detail. Our findings suggest that the positivity bootstrap method is broadly applicable to higher-rank gauge theories beyond the single-trace cases, providing a solid foundation for further non-perturbative investigations of gauge theories using positivity-based methods.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Regularization via Curved Momentum Space: A Geometric Solution to Divergences in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of UV divergences in QFT has long been a fundamental challenge. Standard regularization techniques modify high-energy behavior to ensure well-defined integrals. However, these approaches often introduce unphysical parameters, rely on arbitrary prescriptions, or break fundamental symmetries, making them mathematically effective but conceptually unsatisfactory.
  We propose a novel and self-consistent approach in which UV regularization emerges naturally from the curved geometry of momentum space. Through curved momentum space, imposed by a geodesic metric, we construct an integral measure that inherently suppresses high-energy divergences while preserving fundamental symmetries, including full Lorentz invariance. This framework is self-sufficient, i.e. requires no external regulators. It retains equations of motion and is fully compatibility with standard field theory
  Our approach guarantees the weakest possible suppression necessary for convergence, avoiding excessive modifications to quantum behavior, still achieving convergence. While formulated in Riemannian Geometry, we show seamless extension to Minkowski space, maintainining regularization properties in relativistic QFT. This offers an alternative to ad hoc renormalization, providing an intrinsic and mathematically well-motivated suppression mechanism, purely rooted in curved geometry of momentum space.
  We rigorously construct the measure-theoretic framework and demonstrate its effectiveness by proof of finiteness for key QFT integrals. Beyond resolving divergences, this work suggests broader applications in spectral geometry, effective field theory, and potential extensions to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>On JT gravity path integrals and the tunneling process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity path integral of the trumpet can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an older black hole to a younger one, accompanied by the emission of a baby universe, represented by the geodesic boundary of the trumpet. However, this interpretation becomes less straightforward for geometries with higher genus and multiple geodesic boundaries. In this paper, we examine the path integral for these more complex geometries and find that maintaining this interpretation requires accounting for a portion of the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Geometric Aspects of Type IIA Supersymmetric Backgrounds and Heterotic Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the twisted covariant form hierarchies (TCFH) of (massive) type IIA supergravity for common sector, D-brane and warped product AdS supersymmetric backgrounds and show that the Killing spinor bilinears satisfy a generalisation of the conformal Killing-Yano equation with respect to the TCFH connections. The Killing-St\"ackel, Killing-Yano and closed conformal Killing-Yano tensors of all spherically symmetric (massive) type IIA brane backgrounds are computed and one demonstrates that the geodesic flow on these solutions is completely integrable by giving all independent charges in involution. The Killing spinor form bilinears that generate hidden symmetries for spinning particle and string probe actions on such backgrounds are identified. The interplay between TCFHs and hidden symmetries of probes propagating on these backgrounds is investigated and used to explore the question of whether charges constructed from these bilinears are sufficient to prove the integrability of such probes on this class of backgrounds. Additionally, some of the properties of TCFHs, such as the reduced holonomy of the minimal TCFH connections for generic backgrounds, are investigated. After this, the algebra of holonomy symmetries of sigma models propagating on supersymmetric heterotic backgrounds with a non-compact holonomy group is determined. One demonstrates that these close as a W-algebra that is specified by a Lie algebra structure on the space of covariantly constant forms that generate the holonomy symmetries. In addition, the chiral anomalies associated with these symmetries are identified. Finally, it is argued that these anomalies are consistent and can be cancelled up to two loops in the sigma model perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Exploring the phase diagram of $SU(2)_4$ strange correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phase diagram of a quantum many-body system constructed via the strange correlator approach, based on the non-Abelian $SU(2)_4$ fusion category, to probe topological phase transitions. Using tensor network methods, we numerically compute the half-infinite chain entanglement entropy derived from the dominant eigenvector of the transfer matrix and map the entropy across a spherical two-dimensional parameter space. Our results reveal a phase diagram significantly more complex than previously reported, including a gapless phase consistent with a conformal field theory (CFT) of central charge $c=1$. Critical lines separating distinct phases are identified, with one such line bounding the CFT phase exhibiting a higher central charge $c=2$, indicative of an unconventional critical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider supersymmetric conformal quantum field theories (SCFTs) with degrees of freedom labeled by lattice data. We will assume that in terms of the corresponding lattice the interactions are nearest neighbor and exactly marginal. For example, one can construct such theories by coupling many copies of a single SCFT with exactly marginal deformations. In particular, we discuss the interplay between conformal manifolds of such theories and their global, on-site and lattice, symmetries. We show that one can interpret certain current non-conservation equations for symmetries broken by the interactions as conservation equations including the lattice directions. Moreover, we discuss a class of exactly marginal deformations which are labeled by lattice holonomies that are topological on the lattice. We discuss concrete examples of such constructions and comment on their relevance to compactifications of SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polylogarithms on arbitrary higher-genus Riemann surfaces can be constructed from meromorphic integration kernels with at most simple poles, whose definition was given by Enriquez via functional properties. In this work, homotopy-invariant convolution integrals over homology cycles are shown to provide a direct construction of Enriquez kernels solely from holomorphic Abelian differentials and the prime form. Our new representation is used to demonstrate the closure of the space of Enriquez kernels under convolution over homology cycles and under variations of the moduli. The results of this work further strengthen the remarkable parallels of Enriquez kernels with the non-holomorphic modular tensors recently developed in an alternative construction of higher-genus polylogarithms.</description>

Abstract: We express Kitaev's exact solution of spin models on the honeycomb lattice as a special case of a higher dimensional duality between staggered Majorana fermions and Pauli spins. General models with bilinear nearest neighbor couplings of spins and external magnetic fields are soluble in this way. Each model gives rise to an infinite number of single particle fermion Schrodinger equations, depending on the choice of discrete gauge field flux.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dimension of a General Effective Gauge Theory I: Bosonic Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the physical operators of the most general bosonic effective gauge theory up to dimension six using on-shell methods. Based on this classification, we compute the complete one-loop anomalous dimension employing both on-shell unitarity-based and geometric techniques. Our analysis fully accounts for the mixing of operators with different dimensions. The results broadly apply to any Effective Field Theory with arbitrary gauge symmetry and bosonic degrees of freedom. To illustrate their utility, we perform a complete cross-check of results on the renormalization of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), $O(n)$ scalar theory, and the SMEFT extended with an axion-like particle. Additionally, we present new results for axion-like particles with CP-violating interactions.</description>

      <title>Critical theories connecting gapped phases with $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry from the duality web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the ideas behind the duality web to construct numerous conformal field theories mediating the phase transitions between various symmetry broken and topological phases. In particular we obtain the full field theory version of the Kennedy Tasaki transformation, mapping a gapless theory mediating a topological phase transition of symmetry protected topological orders to a standard symmetry breaking one in a 1+1 dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. When we consider all possible discrete gauging operations, we obtain bosonic and fermionic webs with 9 critical theories per web, each connecting 4 separate gapped phases, some of them topological. Bosonization maps the two webs into each other. In addition to discussing the multi-critical theory connecting the four gapped phases in each phase diagram, we discuss the partially gapped theories connecting two of those four. Some of these are gapless symmetry protected topological phases.</description>

Abstract: We use the effective field theory approach to systematically study the dynamics of classical and quantum systems in an oscillating magnetic field. We find that the fast field oscillations give rise to an effective interaction which is able to confine charged particles as well as neutral particles with a spin magnetic moment. The effect is reminiscent of the renown dynamical stabilization of charges by the oscillating electric field and provides a foundation for a new class of magnetic traps. The properties characteristic to the dynamical magnetic confinement are reviewed.</description>

      <title>Regularized interacting scalar quantum field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider self interacting scalar quantum field theories over a $d$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime with various interaction Lagrangians which are suitable functions of the field. The interacting field observables are represented as power series over the free theory by means of perturbation theory. The object which is employed to obtain this power series is the time ordered exponential of the interaction Lagrangian which is the $S$-matrix of the theory and thus itself a power series in the coupling constant of the theory. We analyze a regularization procedure which makes the $S$-matrix convergent to well defined unitary operators. This regularization depends on two parameters. One describes how much the high frequency contributions in the propagators are tamed and a second one which describes how much the large field contributions are suppressed in the interaction Lagrangian. We finally discuss how to remove the parameters in lower dimensional theories and for specific interaction Lagrangians. In particular, we show that in three spacetime dimensions for a $\phi^4_3$ theory one obtains sequences of unitary operators which are weakly-$*$ convergent to suitable unitary operators in the limit of vanishing parameters. The coefficients of the asymptotic expansion in powers of the coupling constant of all the possible limit points coincide and furthermore agree with the predictions of perturbation theory. Finally we discuss how to extend these results to the case of a $\phi^4_4$ theory were the final results turns out to be very similar to the three dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Non-topological soliton Bardeen boson stars and its frozen state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Bardeen model coupling Einstein gravity with nonlinear electromagnetic fields and non-topological soliton complex scalar fields, governed by the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$, the complex scalar field frequency $\tilde{\omega}$, and the self-interaction parameter $\tilde{\eta}$. Our results reveal that the magnetic charge $\tilde{q}$ exhibits $\tilde{\eta}$-dependent critical values $\tilde{q}_c$, beyond which ($\tilde{q} &gt; \tilde{q}_c$) Bardeen boson stars (BBSs) may transition into frozen states ($\tilde{\omega} \to 0$). These frozen states are characterized by a critical horizon whose radius $\tilde r^\mathrm{H}_{c}$ satisfies $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}} &lt; \tilde r_{c} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{H,RN}}$, where $\tilde r_{\text{inner}}^{\text{H,RN}}$ and $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{RN}}$ denote the inner and outer horizons of magnetic Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with equivalent mass and magnetic charge. Notably, the ADM mass of frozen BBSs is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Furthermore, light ring (LR) solutions exist universally across all tested combinations of $\tilde{q}$ and $\tilde{\eta}$, with all frozen BBSs exhibiting LRs whose outer radius $\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}}$ is independent of $\tilde{\eta}$. Compared to magnetic RN black holes, frozen BBSs possess a smaller outer LR radius ($\tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR}} &lt; \tilde r_{\text{outer}}^{\text{LR, RN}}$).</description>

      <title>Monomer-dimer tensor-network basis for qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theories (LGTs) can be formulated using an orthonormal basis constructed from the irreducible representations (irreps) $V_{\lambda}$ of the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge symmetry. On a lattice, the elements of this basis are tensor networks comprising dimer tensors on the links labeled by a set of irreps $\{\lambda_\ell\}$ and monomer tensors on sites labeled by $\{\lambda_s\}$. These tensors naturally define a local site Hilbert space, $\mathcal{H}^g_s$, on which gauge transformations act. Gauss's law introduces an additional index $\alpha_s = 1, 2, \dots, \mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H}_s^g)$ that labels an orthonormal basis of the gauge-invariant subspace of $\mathcal{H}^g_s$. This monomer-dimer tensor-network (MDTN) basis, $\left| \{\lambda_s\},\{\lambda_\ell\},\{\alpha_s\}\right\rangle$, of the physical Hilbert space enables the construction of new qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ gauge theories that are free of sign problems while preserving key features of traditional LGTs. Here, we investigate finite-temperature confinement-deconfinement transitions in a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory in $d=2$ and $d=3$ spatial dimensions, formulated using the MDTN basis, and show that they reproduce the universal results of traditional LGTs at these transitions. Additionally, in $d=1$, we demonstrate using a plaquette chain that the string tension at zero temperature can be continuously tuned to zero by adjusting a model parameter that plays the role of the gauge coupling in traditional LGTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the development of light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in coordinate space (C-LCOPT). Compared to light-cone-ordered perturbation theory in momentum space (LCOPT), the role of intermediate states in LCOPT is played in C-LCOPT by paths, which are ordered sequences of lines and vertices that connect pairs of external points. Each path denominator of C-LCOPT equals the difference between the separation of the minus coordinates of the beginning and ending points of the path and the sum of the light-cone minus momenta of all lines along the path computed from their plus and transverse coordinates. We observe that this formalism, originally applied to amplitudes, can be extended to cross sections, which are given in terms of closed paths reminiscent of Schwinger-Keldysh formalisms.</description>

      <title>Dragging of inertial frames in the composed Kerr-Newman-orbiting-ring system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting object implies that the horizon angular velocity $\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}$ of a central black hole in a composed black-hole-orbiting-ring system is no longer related to its angular-momentum $J_{\text{H}}$ by the familiar vacuum functional relation $\Omega_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})=J_{\text{H}}/M\alpha$ (here $\{M,\alpha\}$ are respectively the mass and normalized area of the central spinning black hole). Using a continuity argument, it has recently been revealed that the composed Kerr-ring system is characterized by the universal (that is, spin-{\it independent}) relation $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}\equiv\Omega^{\text{BH-ring}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}},J_{\text{R}},R\to R^{+}_{\text{H}})-\Omega^{\text{Kerr}}_{\text{H}}(J_{\text{H}})={{J_{\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$, where $\{R,J_{\text{R}}\}$ are respectively the radius of the ring and its orbital angular momentum and $R_{\text{H}}$ is the horizon radius of the central Kerr black hole. This intriguing observation naturally raises the following physically interesting question: Does the physical quantity $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}$ in a composed black-hole-orbiting-ring system is always characterized by the near-horizon functional relation $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}={{J_{\text{R}}}/{4M^3}}$ which is independent of the spin (angular momentum) $J_{\text{H}}$ of the central black hole? In the present compact paper we explore the physical phenomenon of dragging of inertial frames by an orbiting ring in the composed Kerr-Newman-black-hole-orbiting-ring system. In particular, using analytical techniques, we reveal the fact that in this composed two-body (black-hole-ring) system the quantity $\Delta\Omega_{\text{H}}$ has an explicit non-trivial functional dependence on the angular momentum $J_{\text{H}}$ of the central spinning black hole.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle involves a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. This is done with a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free-fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic symmetries, such as the BMS group for asymptotically flat spacetimes, provide a natural framework for describing particles in quantum gravity where spacetimes highly fluctuate. Similar techniques have also been applied to systems with boundaries at finite distances. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional quantum gravity on a finite-radius twisted thermal flat background with a conical defect, representing a test point particle. By computing the one-loop partition function in both discrete and continuum geometry settings, we recover the massive BMS$_3$ character. The additional modes, compared to the vacuum case, arise from broken diffeomorphism symmetry due to the conical defect.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-to-dS and dS-to-dS transitions: Implications for the $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and cosmological implications of dark energy (DE), modeled as a scalar field with a hyperbolic tangent potential that induces a smooth shift in the effective cosmological constant (CC), encompassing transitions such as AdS-dS, 0-dS, and dS-dS, with the mirror AdS-dS as a particular case aligned with the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. In our construction, a phantom scalar field with a negative kinetic term drives a bottom-up transition from an AdS-like vacuum at high redshifts to a dS-like vacuum at low redshifts, thereby providing a physical underpinning for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario. Despite the negative kinetic term, the step-like form of the potential prevents pathologies such as unbounded energy growth, Big Rip, and violations of the WEC. Our numerical integration of the equations of motion shows that the model is consistent with both CMB data and the SH0ES determination of $H_0$, thereby addressing the $H_0$ tension, with all key kinematical parameters-$H(z)$, $\dot{H}(z)$, and $q(z)$-evolving smoothly. The total energy density of the phantom and matter system remains positive at all times, and the effective EoS stays above -1, ensuring that the WEC is satisfied. While the phantom field's energy density and pressure remain finite throughout, its EoS exhibits a safe singularity as its energy density smoothly crosses zero. We perform analysis of the transition period, demonstrating that the evolution of the DE density from a negative CC-like regime to a positive one does not exactly mirror the behavior of the potential-e.g., it lasts longer-as it also involves the kinetic term. We also show that analogous quintessence models featuring dS-dS transitions predict an $H_0$ value lower than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby failing to address the $H_0$ tension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenario.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory reproducing the MOND phenomenology based on a non-Abelian Yang-Mills graviphoton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the phenomenology of MOND, we propose a theory based on a fundamental non Abelian Yang-Mills gauge field with gravitational coupling constant (a "graviphoton") emerging in a regime of weak acceleration, i.e. below the MOND acceleration scale. Using the formalism of the effective field theory and invoking a mechanism of gravitational polarization of the dark matter medium, we show that generic solutions of this theory reproduce the deep MOND limit without having to introduce in an ad hoc way an arbitrary function in the action. In this framework, MOND is due to the existence of a new sector of the standard model of particle physics. Furthermore, the model involves a fundamental violation of the local Lorentz invariance in the low acceleration regime. We show how to restore the general covariance of the model by adding one gravitational degree of freedom in the form of the scalar Khronon field.</description>

Abstract: We explore purely metric theories of gravity with second-order equations of motion and a single additional, purely gravitational, propagating, scalar degree of freedom. We identify a subclass of these theories in which this scalar causes a phenomenon similar to black-hole scalarization, which we call curvaturization: around small enough Kerr black holes, the scalar induces a tachyonic instability. This triggers a sudden growth of Ricci curvature and results in a new branch of vacuum black-hole solutions. We study the properties of these black holes both in the static as well as the spinning case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the Pontryagin model adopting different geometric-covariant approaches. In particular, we focus on the manner in which boundary conditions must be imposed on the background manifold in order to reproduce an unambiguous theory on the boundary. At a Lagrangian level, we describe the symmetries of the theory and construct the Lagrangian covariant momentum map which allows for an extension of Noether's theorems. Through the multisymplectic analysis we obtain the covariant momentum map associated with the action of the gauge group on the covariant multimomenta phase-space. By performing a space plus time decomposition by means of a foliation of the appropriate bundles, we are able to recover not only the $t$-instantaneous Lagrangian and Hamiltonian of the theory, but also the generator of the gauge transformations. In the polysymplectic framework we perform a Poisson-Hamilton analysis with the help of the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian and the Poisson-Gerstenhaber bracket. Remarkably, as long as we consider a background manifold with boundary, in all of these geometric formulations, we are able to recover the so-called differentiability conditions as a straightforward consequence of Noether's theorem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy evolution during gravitational collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the ground state entanglement entropy for a discretized scalar field propagating within the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse metric. Starting from a well-controlled initial configuration, we follow the system as it evolves toward the formation of a horizon and, eventually, a singularity. Our approach employs an Ermakov-like equation to determine the time-dependent ground state of the field and calculates the resulting entanglement entropy by tracing out the degrees of freedom inside a spherical region within the matter sphere. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits nontrivial scaling and time dependence during collapse. Close to the horizon, the entropy can deviate from the simple area law, reflecting the rapid changes in geometry and field configuration. Although the model is idealized, these results provide insights into the generation and scaling of entanglement in the presence of realistic, dynamically evolving gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Primordial full bispectra from the general bounce cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial non-Gaussianities are key quantities to test early universe scenarios. In this paper, we compute full bispectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated during a contracting phase in a general bounce model. The general bounce model consists of two branches: one realizes scale-invariant scalar and tensor power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes become constant on superhorizon scales, as in de Sitter inflation, while the other realizes scale-invariant power spectra from perturbations whose amplitudes grow on superhorizon scales, as in matter bounce cosmology. We study the auto- and cross-bispectra originating from the scale-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations in these two branches. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of non-Gaussianities and find that the differences between the two branches manifest for equilateral and squeezed momentum triangle configurations. In particular, one of the branches in which the superhorizon perturbations are conserved reproduces the so-called Maldacena's consistency relation. By examining perturbativity conditions and considering current observational constraints on primordial non-Gaussianities, we also find a viable parameter space in which both theoretical and observational constraints are satisfied simultaneously.</description>

      <title>A teleportation protocol in Schwarzschild-de Sitter space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new information transfer protocol for de Sitter space, using black holes as energy reservoirs. We consider antipodal observers in pure de Sitter space in the Bunch-Davis state. They can store Hawking modes from the cosmological horizon in a box. Alternatively, due to thermal fluctuations in de Sitter space, black holes formed through a pair-creation {process can be used} as energy reservoirs. We focus on the Nariai black hole case, which corresponds to an equilibrium state. Once the black hole is produced, energy pulses can be released into its interior, opening a traversable wormhole. We provide bounds for the amount of information that can be transferred. Specializing in (1+1)-dimensions, we explore how the teleportation protocol leads to an explicit geometric description of the information transmitted through an island region. The protocol uncovers quantum information aspects of de Sitter space, independently of any particular realization of de Sitter space holography.</description>

      <title>The Parisi-Sourlas Uplift and Infinitely Many Solvable 4d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry is known to emerge in some models with random field type of disorder. When PS SUSY is present the $d$-dimensional theory allows for a $d-2$-dimensional description. In this paper we investigate the reversed question and we provide new indications that any given CFT$_{d-2}$ can be uplifted to a PS SUSY CFT$_{d}$. We show that any scalar four-point function of a CFT$_{d-2}$ is mapped to a set of 43 four-point functions of the uplifted CFT$_{d}$ which are related to each other by SUSY and satisfy all necessary bootstrap axioms. As a byproduct we find 43 non trivial relations between conformal blocks across dimensions.
  We test the uplift in generalized free field theory (GFF) and find that PS SUSY is a powerful tool to bootstrap an infinite class of previously unknown GFF observables. Some of this power is shown to persist in perturbation theory around GFF.
  We explain why all diagonal minimal models admit an uplift and we show exact results for correlators and CFT data of the $4d$ uplift of the Ising model. Despite being strongly coupled $4d$ CFTs, the uplifted minimal models contain infinitely many conserved currents and are expected to be integrable.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuation on the worldsheet of probe string in BTZ black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the second-order normal quantum fluctuation on the world-sheet of a probe string in the Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. These fluctuations is treated as the projection of Hawking radiation on the worldsheet and indeed modify the action growth of the string. Then in the string field theory/boundary conformal field theory framework, via the boundary vertex operator we study the correlation function of the Schr\"odinger functional of excited fields on the world-sheet and further extract the field's formula. Our study could shed light on the potential connection between complexity growth and correlation function.</description>

      <title>Hagedorn temperature in holography: world-sheet and effective approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide general results on the Hagedorn temperature of planar, strongly coupled confining gauge theories holographically dual to type II superstring models on curved backgrounds with Ramond-Ramond and Kalb-Ramond fluxes and non-trivial dilaton. For exact backgrounds the Hagedorn temperature is determined up to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) in an expansion in $\alpha'$; in all the other cases the results can be safely trusted up to NNLO. To reach these goals we exploit two complementary approaches. On the one hand, we perform an extrapolation to the Hagedorn regime of world-sheet results obtained from the semiclassical quantization of string configurations winding around the compact Euclidean time direction. En passant, we provide a detailed derivation of the fermionic part of the world-sheet spectrum, which is hard to find in the literature. On the other hand, we perturbatively solve the equations of motion for the thermal scalar field corresponding to the lightest mode of the winding string, which in flat space becomes tachyonic above the Hagedorn temperature. The interplay between different approaches is surely convenient, but we provide insights about a possible derivation of the whole NNLO correction to the Hagedorn temperature from a pure world-sheet perspective; furthermore, we determine the effective mass of the thermal scalar from the world-sheet in full generality.</description>

      <title>All vertices for unconstrained symmetric gauge fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the generating system that describes interacting symmetric higher-spin gauge fields at the level of equations of motion was proposed. The interaction vertices it offers are 'off the mass shell' unless constrained by the prescribed factorization condition that properly removes traceful components. In this paper we detail the structure of the unconstrained, i.e., traceful vertices. We derive their manifest form to all orders along with a net of the associated dualities, thus providing the complete higher-spin vertex analysis at the unconstrained level for the bosonic theory in any dimension. These vertices are shown to be the minimal space-time local and have a form of the peculiar integrals over a space of closed polygons, which we scrutinize in the paper. The obtained results directly apply to the holomorphic sector of the four-dimensional theory, where the interaction is on shell, producing the all-order chiral higher-spin vertices.</description>

      <title>The physical moduli of heterotic G_2 string compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works, an operator was developed for heterotic compactifications on $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}\times G_2$ and $AdS_3 \times G_2$, which preserves $N=1$ $d=3$ supersymmetry and whose kernel is related to the moduli of the compactification. The operator is described in terms of non-physical spurious degrees of freedom, specifically, deformations of a connection on the tangent bundle. In this paper, we eliminate these spurious degrees of freedom by linking deformations of the spin connection to the moduli of the $G_2$ manifold $Y$. This results in an operator $\check D$ that captures the physical moduli space of the $G_2$ heterotic string theory. When $Y=X\times S^1$, with $X$ an $SU(3)$ manifold, we show $\check D$ produces results that align with existing literature. This allows us to propose a $G_2$ moduli space metric. We check that this metric reduces to the $SU(3)$ moduli metric constructed in the literature. We then define an adjoint operator ${\check D}^\dag$. We show the $G_2$ moduli correspond to the intersection of the kernels of $\check D$ and ${\check D}^\dag$. These kernels reduce to the $SU(3)$ F-terms and D-terms respectively on $X\times S^1$. This gives two non-trivial consistency checks of our proposed moduli space metric. Working perturbatively in $\alpha'$, we also demonstrate that the heterotic $G_2$ moduli problem can be characterised in terms of a double extension of ordinary bundles, just like in the $SU(3)$ case.</description>

      <title>Holographic Carrollian Currents for Massless Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Ward identities of a Carrollian CFT stress tensor at null infinity reproduce the leading and subleading soft graviton theorems for massless scattering in the bulk. We deduce the expressions of the stress tensor components in terms of the bulk radiative modes, and these components turn out to be local at $\mathscr{I}$ in terms of the twistor potentials. This analysis makes the correspondence between the large-time limit of Carrollian amplitudes and the soft limit of momentum space amplitudes manifest. We then construct Carrollian CFT currents from the ascendants of the hard graviton operator, which satisfy the $Lw_{1+\infty}$ algebra. We show that the large-time limit of their Ward identities implies an infinite tower of projected soft graviton theorems in the bulk, while their finite-time OPEs encode the collinear limit of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Exact large $N$ expansion of mass deformed ABJM theory on squashed sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the partition function of the mass deformed ABJM theory on a squashed three sphere. In particular, we focus on the case with the Chern-Simons levels being $\pm 1$ and apply a duality between this theory and the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $\mathrm{U}\left(N\right)$ super Yang-Mills theory with an adjoint hypermultiplet and a fundamental hypermultiplet. For a special mass parameter depending on the squashing parameter, we find that the partition function can be written as that of an ideal Fermi gas with a non-trivial density matrix. By studying this density matrix, we analytically derive the all order perturbative expansion of the partition function in $1/N$, which turns out to take the form of the Airy function. Our results not only align with previous findings and conjectures but also lead to a new formula for the overall constant factor of the partition function. We also study the exact values of the partition function for small but finite values of $N$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Scattering Enhancement from the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a charged particle scattering off of an Aharonov-Bohm cosmic string. A classic computation gave an infinite total scattering cross section, leading to a Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement which can have important implications on baryon number asymmetry in the early universe. However, unlike the Callan-Rubakov effect, the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is topological and thus it is surprising that it leads to such a dramatic dynamical effect for single particle scattering. We reexamine this old problem through the modern lens of generalized global symmetries by embedding Aharanov-Bohm strings in a discrete gauge theory. We show that the scattering cross section is suppressed by the core size and there is thus no Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement.</description>

Abstract: In a recent paper, Anupam, Chowdhury, and Sen [arXiv:2308.00038] constructed the non-extremal saddle that reproduces the supersymmetric index of the BMPV black hole with three independent charges in the classical limit. This saddle solution is a finite temperature complex solution saturating the BPS bound. In this paper, we write this solution in a canonical form in terms of harmonic functions on three-dimensional flat base space, thereby showing that it is supersymmetric. We also show that it exhibits the new form of attraction.</description>

Abstract: Semiclassical quantization techniques are unreliable, if the magnitude of the quantum fluctuations becomes comparable with a classical background scale. This is the case, for example, for superstrings at temperatures close to the Hagedorn temperature. Here, we propose a non-standard treatment which aims to extend the semiclassical approach for type-II superstrings to such cases. This allows us to provide a well-posed reformulation of recent computations of the Hagedorn temperature in a large class of confining gauge theories. Along the way, we fill a gap in the literature by proving that the standard semiclassical one-loop partition function of the Green-Schwarz superstring can be made finite, by means of a suitable choice of integration measures, for any background worldsheet in a target spacetime satisfying the (type-IIA) supergravity field equations.</description>

      <title>A new look at multi-gravity and dimensional deconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been understood that certain theories of ghost free massive gravity and their multi-graviton extensions can be thought of as arising from a higher dimensional theory of gravity, upon discretising the extra dimension. However, this correspondence between standard multi-gravity and extra dimensional gravity holds only when one discretises the extra dimension after gauge fixing the lapse function associated to the various lower dimensional hypersurfaces. The lapse provides crucial structure to the extra dimensional theory: in pure general relativity (GR), it ensures full diffeomorphism invariance of the theory, and enforces its Hamiltonian constraint. Thus, upon deconstruction, important information related to the extra dimension is missing in the resulting multi-gravity theory; as a result one could never hope to recover higher dimensional GR in its entirety upon taking the appropriate continuum limit. Here, we develop an improved deconstruction procedure that maintains the free lapse, and show that the resulting deconstructed theory is essentially multi-gravity equipped with additional dynamical scalar fields, whose field equations encode the Hamiltonian constraint in the extra dimensional theory. As an example, we explicitly demonstrate that - with an FLRW ansatz for the metrics in this new theory - one may recover all of the equations and constraints of 5-dimensional brane cosmology upon taking the continuum limit. We then treat the deconstructed theory as an entity in its own right, and generalise it to arbitrary dimension and interaction structures beyond those admitting a well-defined continuum limit. We dub this theory `scalar-tensor multi-gravity', and show that the new scalar equations change the structure of some simple solutions that were previously allowed in standard multi-gravity, in a manner that exactly mirrors what we expect from higher dimensional GR.</description>

      <title>Courant Algebroid Relations, T-Dualities and Generalised Ricci Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of Courant algebroid relation is used to introduce a definition of relation between divergence operators on Courant algebroids. By introducing invariant divergence operators, a notion of generalised T-duality between divergences is presented through an existence and uniqueness result for related divergence operators on T-dual pairs of exact Courant algebroids, which naturally incorporates the dilaton shift. When combined with the notion of generalised isometry, this establishes circumstances under which generalised Ricci tensors are related, proving that T-duality is compatible with generalised string background equations. This enables an analysis of the compatibility between T-duality and generalised Ricci flow, showing that the T-dual of a solution of generalised Ricci flow is also a solution of generalised Ricci flow. Our constructions are illustrated through many explicit examples.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity: Emergence of Gravity in an Infinitely Divisible Quantum Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02813v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is a foundationally quantum approach to cosmology and gravity. It assumes that the Hilbert space of the Universe as a whole represents the symmetry group $SU(\infty)$, and demonstrates this symmetry for Hilbert spaces of infinite number of subsystems, which randomly emerge and represent arbitrary finite rank {\it internal} symmetries. The aim of present work is in depth study of the foundation and properties of this model. We show that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement of each subsystem with the rest of the Universe. We demonstrate that the states of subsystems depend on a dimensionful parameter arising due to the breaking of a global $U(1)$ symmetry. A relative dynamics arises when an arbitrary subsystem is selected as a quantum clock with a time parameter. Thus, states of subsystems are characterized by 4 continuous parameters related to their $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and dynamics, plus discrete parameters characterizing their internal symmetries. We demonstrate the irrelevance of the geometry of this parameter space for observables. On the other hand, we use quantum speed limits to show that the perceived classical spacetime and its Lorentzian geometry emerge as an average path of subsystems in their Hilbert space. In this respect, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ fundamentally deviates from gauge-gravity duality models. Invariance under reparameterization restricts the action of subsystems dynamics to a Yang-Mills quantum field theory defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space for both $SU(\infty)$ - gravity - and internal symmetries. Consequently, $SU(\infty)-QGR$ is renormalizable, but predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity. Nonetheless, it is proved that when quantum gravity effects are not detectable, the dynamics is perceived as the Einstein-Hilbert action. We briefly discuss $SU(\infty)-QGR$ specific models for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometric formulation of Brans-Dicke theory for Bianchi I spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Bianchi I spacetimes within the Jordan frame of Brans-Dicke theory, incorporating the framework of effective loop quantum gravity. After developing general formulas, we analyze the robustness of classical singularity resolution due to quantum geometric effects using two common quantization schemes. We then compare the resulting physical properties. We find that both schemes replace classical singularities with regular quantum bounces. Notably, in contrast to similar studies based on general relativity, we find that all three directional scale factors of the Bianchi I spacetimes increase and after the quantum bounce they reach values similar to their initial values, leading to a merging with classical spacetimes in both schemes.</description>

      <title>Squashed quantum non-Markovianity: a measure of genuine quantum non-Markovianity in states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum non-Markovianity in tripartite quantum states $\rho_{ABC}$ represents a correlation between systems $A$ and $C$ when conditioned on the system $B$ and is known to have both classical and quantum contributions. However, a systematic characterization of the latter is missing. To address this, we propose a faithful measure for non-Markovianity of genuine quantum origin called squashed quantum non-Markovianity (sQNM). It is based on the quantum conditional mutual information and is defined by the left-over non-Markovianity after squashing out all non-quantum contributions. It is lower bounded by the squashed entanglement between non-conditioning systems in the reduced state and is delimited by the extendibility of either of the non-conditioning systems. We show that the sQNM is monogamous, asymptotically continuous, convex, additive on tensor-product states, and generally super-additive. We characterize genuine quantum non-Markovianity as a resource via a convex resource theory after identifying free states with vanishing sQNM and free operations that do not increase sQNM in states. We use our resource-theoretic framework to bound the rate of state transformations under free operations and to study state transformation under non-free operations; in particular, we find the quantum communication cost from Bob ($B$) to Alice ($A$) or Charlie ($C$) is lower bounded by the change in sQNM in the states. The sQNM finds operational meaning; in particular, the optimal rate of private communication in a variant of conditional one-time pad protocol is twice the sQNM. Also, the minimum deconstruction cost for a variant of quantum deconstruction protocol is given twice the sQNM of the state.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Luttinger parameter from a single wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy physics of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) is controlled by the Luttinger parameter. We demonstrate that this parameter can be extracted from a single wave function for one-component TLLs with periodic boundary condition. This method relies on the fact that TLLs are described by conformal field theory in which crosscap states can be constructed. The overlaps between the crosscap states and the ground state as well as some excited states are proved to be universal numbers that directly reveal the Luttinger parameter. In microscopic lattice models, crosscap states are formed by putting each pair of antipodal sites into a maximally entangled state. Analytical and numerical calculations are performed in a few representative models to substantiate the conformal field theory prediction. The extracted Luttinger parameters are generally quite accurate in finite-size systems with moderate lengths, so there is no need to perform data fitting and/or finite-size scaling.</description>

Abstract: Non-relativistic quantum mechanics was originally formulated to describe particles. Using ideas from the geometric quantization approach, we show how the concept of antiparticles can and should be introduced in the non-relativistic case without appealing to quantum field theory. We discuss this in detail using the example of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Key drivers of the preference for dynamic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03983v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurement by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) first data release, Type Ia supernovae (SNe) of the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DES5YR) release and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data favors a quintom-like dynamic dark energy model over the standard Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model at $3.9\sigma$ level (Adame et al. 2024). We confirm the previous finding in the literature that the preference for dynamic dark energy does not rely on the detailed modeling of CMB physics and remains at a similar significance level ($3.2\sigma$) when the full CMB likelihood is replaced by a CMB acoustic-oscillation angle ($\theta_\star$) prior and a baryon abundance ($\Omega_bh^2$) prior. The computationally efficient $\theta_\star$ and $\Omega_bh^2$ priors allow us to take a frequentist approach by comparing DES5YR SNe and DESI BAO with a large number ($\gtrsim 10^4$) of Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. We find that $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy is very rare (occurrence rate = $0.28\%$) in simulations. When we combine DESI BAO with SN simulations or combine DES5YR SNe with BAO simulations, the occurrence rate of $\geq 3.2\sigma$ preference for dynamic dark energy increases to $1.2\%$ and $4.8\%$, respectively. These results indicate an internal inconsistency, i.e., a significant tension between DESI BAO + DES5YR SNe and Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models in both Bayesian and frequentist points of view. Although both DESI BAO and DES5YR SNe contribute to the preference for dynamic dark energy, the contribution from DES5YR SNe is more significant. In the frequentist point of view, even DES5YR SNe alone is in tension with Planck-constrained $\Lambda$CDM models, though in Bayesian point of view this tension is prior dependent and inconclusive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new set of BMS charges at null infinity, characterized by a super-translation flux that contains only the `hard' term. This is achieved with a specific corner improvement of the symplectic 2-form, and we spell the conditions under which it is unique. The charges are associated to a Wald-Zoupas symplectic potential, and satisfy all standard criteria: they are covariant, provide a center-less realization of the symmetry algebra, have vanishing flux in non-radiative spacetimes, and vanish in Minkowski. We use them to define a notion of spatially localized energy density of gravitational waves, and explain how it can be measured doing experiments which are purely local in space and over an extended period of time.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physics with the Lyman-alpha forest: constraints on the growth of structure and neutrino masses from SDSS with effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory (EFT) approach to extract fundamental cosmological parameters from the Lyman-alpha forest flux fluctuations as an alternative to the standard simulation-based techniques. As a first application, we re-analyze the publicly available one-dimensional Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our analysis relies on informative priors on EFT parameters which we extract from a combination of public hydrodynamic simulation and emulator data. Assuming the concordance cosmological model, our one-parameter analysis yields a $2\%$ measurement of the late time mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.841\pm 0.017$, or equivalently, the structure growth parameter $S_8 = 0.852\pm 0.017$, consistent with the standard cosmology. This result is obtained assuming that non-linear EFT parameters are cosmology-independent functions of the linear bias parameter. When this assumption is loosened, the limit degrades by a factor of 3, suggesting that informative priors are necessary for competitive constraints. Combining our EFT likelihood with Planck + baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find a new constraint on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu&lt;$ 0.08 eV (at 95\% CL). Our study defines priorities for the development of EFT methods and sets the benchmark for cosmological analyses of the Lyman-alpha forest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive areal inequalities for five types of attractive gravity probe surfaces, which were proposed by us in order to characterize the strength of gravity in different ways including weak gravity region, taking into account of contributions of electric and magnetic charges, angular momentum, gravitational waves, and matters. These inequalities are generalizations of the Riemannian Penrose inequality for minimal surfaces, and lead to the concept of extremality for a given surface whose condition is given in terms of the gravitational mass and the electromagnetic charges. This means that the extremality is a characteristic property not only of black hole horizons or minimal surfaces but also of surfaces in weak gravity region. We also derive areal inequalities and extremality conditions for surfaces in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constant roll and non-Gaussian tail in light of logarithmic duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curvature perturbation in a model of constant-roll (CR) inflation is interpreted in view of the logarithmic duality discovered in Ref. [1] according to the $\delta N$ formalism. We confirm that the critical value $\beta:=\ddot{\varphi}/(H\dot{\varphi})=-3/2$ determining whether the CR condition is stable or not is understood as the point at which the dual solutions, i.e., the attractor and non-attractor solutions of the field equation, are interchanged. For the attractor-solution domination, the curvature perturbation in the CR model is given by a simple logarithmic mapping of a Gaussian random field, which can realise both the exponential tail (i.e., the single exponential decay) and the Gumbel-distribution-like tail (i.e., the double exponential decay) of the probability density function, depending on the value of $\beta$. Such a tail behaviour is important for, e.g., the estimation of the primordial black hole abundance.</description>

      <title>A simple gravitational self-decoherence model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most significant debates of our time is whether our macroscopic world (i) naturally emerges from quantum mechanics or (ii) requires new physics. We argue for the latter and propose a simple gravitational self-decoherence mechanism. For this purpose, we postulate the existence of a Heisenberg cut such that particles with masses $m$ much smaller and larger than a critical mass $M_{\rm C}$ (of the order of the Planck mass $M_{\rm P}$) would be necessarily treated according to quantum and classical rules, respectively. Our effective model is designed to capture the new physics that free quantum particles would experience as their masses approach $M_{\rm C}$. The purity loss for free quantum particles is evaluated and shown to be highly inefficient for quantum particles with $m \ll M_{\rm C}$ but very effective for those with $m \sim M_{\rm C}$. The physical picture behind it is that coherence would (easily) leak from heavy enough particles to (non-observable) spacetime quantum degrees of freedom. Finally, we contextualize our proposal with state-of-the-art experiments and show how it can be tested in a future Stern-Gerlach-like experiment.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in virtual transitions between uniformly accelerated and static atoms: from a bird's eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the prospect of the equivalence principle at the quantum regime by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector in different scenarios. In particular, two specific set-ups are considered. ($i$) $Without~a~boundary$: In one scenario the atom is in uniform acceleration and interacting with Minkowski field modes. While in the other the atom is static and in interaction with Rindler field modes. ($ii$) $With~a~reflecting~boundary$: In one scenario, the atom is uniformly accelerated, and the mirror is static, and in the other scenario, the atom is static, and the mirror is in uniform acceleration. In these cases, the atom interacts with the field modes, defined in the mirror's frame. For both the set-ups, the focus is on the excitation and de-excitation probabilities in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Our observations affirm that in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for both set-ups the transition probabilities from different scenarios become the same when the atomic and the field frequencies are equal. In contrast, in $(3+1)$ dimensions this equivalence is not observed in general, inspiring us to look for a deeper physical interpretation. Our findings suggest that when the equivalence between different scenarios is concerned, the excitation to de-excitation ratio provides a more consistent measure even in $(3+1)$ dimensions. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hawking evaporation of black holes formed by dark matter in compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The memory burden effect is an explicit resolution to the information paradox by which an evaporating black hole acquires quantum hair, which then suppresses its rate of mass loss with respect to the semi-classical Hawking rate. We show that this has significant implications for particle dark matter that captures in neutron stars and forms black holes that go on to consume the host star. In particular, we show that constraints on the nucleon scattering cross section and mass of spin-0 and spin-1/2 dark matter would be extended by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Transition between critical antiferromagnetic phases in the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $J_1$--$J_2$ spin chain is one of the canonical models of quantum magnetism, and has long been known to host a critical antiferromagnetic phase with power-law decay of spin correlations. We show in this letter that there are, in fact, two distinct critical phases: the `Affleck-Haldane' phase, where the dimer field that parametrises local singlet order is part of a joint $O(4)$ N\'eel-singlet order parameter; and the `Zirnbauer' phase, where the dimer field is gapped out and the critical theory involves only an $O(3)$ N\'eel order parameter. The phases are so-named because each realises one of the competing pictures for how the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model with a topological theta term renormalises to the $\mathfrak{\hat{su}}(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten model.</description>

      <title>Gross-Neveu-Yukawa SO(2) and SO(3) tensorial criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16842v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic SO(2)- and SO(3)-invariant Gross-Neveu-Yukawa field theories for real, rank-two, symmetric, traceless tensor order parameters coupled to $N_{\text{f}}$ flavors of two-component Dirac fermions. These field theories arise as an effective description of fractionalized spin-orbital liquids. The two theories are the simplest and special cases of the more general class of field theories with SO($N$) symmetric tensor order parameter coupled to Dirac fermions, in which the symmetry is low enough to allow only one, and not the usual two quartic self-interaction terms. Using two-loop renormalization group near the upper critical dimension, we demonstrate that the theory exhibits a new critical fixed point for $N=3$ and the concomitant continuous phase transition for any value of $N_{\text{f}}$. For $N=2$ the theory is equivalent to the chiral XY model. We discuss the crucial role of the symmetry-allowed sextic self-interactions in the selection of the ground state configuration in the case of SO(3). The universal quantities such as the the anomalous dimensions of order parameters and fermions, the correlation length exponent, and the mass gap ratio between order parameter and fermion masses are computed up to $\epsilon^{2}$ order.</description>

      <title>Low-curvature quantum corrections from unitary evolution of de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of de Sitter space formulated as a minisuperspace model with flat spatial hypersurfaces in unimodular gravity, both in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Time evolution is defined naturally in unimodular time, which appears as conjugate to the cosmological (integration) constant. We show that requiring unitary time evolution "resolves" the de Sitter horizon where the flat slicing breaks down and leads to strong quantum effects there, even though locally nothing special happens at this surface. For a cosmological constant that is far below the Planck scale, loop quantum gravity corrections do not alter the main results in any substantial way. This model illustrates the fundamental clash between general covariance and unitarity in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative constraints on perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Rainbow chains and numerical renormalisation group for accurate chiral conformal spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the relationship between reduced and thermal density matrices in conformal field theory (CFT), we show that the entanglement spectrum of a conformal critical chain with exponentially decaying terms consists of conformal towers of the associated chiral CFT, with only weak finite-size effects. Through free-fermion and interacting examples, we show that these entanglement spectra present a reliable method to extract detailed CFT spectra from single wave functions without access to the parent Hamiltonian. We complement our method with a Wilsonian numerical renormalisation group algorithm for solving interacting, exponentially decaying chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Dense and magnetized QCD from imaginary chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we computed the equation of state of dense QCD in the presence of background magnetic fields using lattice QCD simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential. Our simulations include 2+1+1 flavors of stout-smeared staggered fermions with masses at the physical point and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action. Using several expansion schemes, we tuned our simulation parameters such that the equation of state satisfies strangeness neutrality and isospin asymmetry constraints, which are relevant to the phenomenology of heavy-ion collisions. Our results suggest a strong change in the equation of state due to the magnetic field, in particular, around the crossover temperature. A continuum extrapolation of our data is still needed for future applications of our equation of state to heavy-ion-collision phenomenology.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Mechanics of Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics are well understood in the frameworks of quantum field theory and general relativity, with contemporary extensions in string theory, AdS/CFT, and loop quantum gravity. However, an open question remains: Can Hawking radiation be consistently described using statistical mechanics? This challenge arises due to the ambiguous quantum nature of Hawking particles and constraints imposed by information conservation. This study develops a heuristic statistical model using a worldine Lagrangian formalism, treating Hawking particles as timelike with an effective mass and following an arbitrary statistical distribution. The flow of information is modeled as a transfer of microstates from the event horizon to the radiation background within a closed ensemble. From this framework, the Hawking particle mass $m_H=\hbar/(2\pi r_S)$ is recovered, and the worldline Lagrangian yields the black hole's thermal energy, $E=\hbar/(8\pi GM)$. Beyond preserving conventional insights, reinforcing the statistical nature of black hole evaporation, this approach introduces novel perspectives: modeling the black hole as a structured energy well containing microstates, quantifying the evaporation rate of individual microstates, and determining the total number of microstates from the horizon's surface area. This study leaves the door open for a stochastic mechanical analysis, which is introduced in the Discussion section.</description>
