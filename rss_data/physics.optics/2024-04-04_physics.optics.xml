      <title>Implantable silicon neural probes with nanophotonic phased arrays for single-lobe beam steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brain activity mapping experiments using optogenetics, patterned illumination is crucial for deterministic and localized stimulation of neurons. However, due to optical scattering in brain tissue, light-emitting implantable devices are needed to bring precise patterned illumination to deep brain regions. A promising solution is silicon neural probes with integrated nanophotonic circuits that form tailored beam emission patterns without lenses. Here, we demonstrate neural probes with grating-based light emitters that generate a single steerable light beam across $&gt; 60\%$ of the steering range with $\ge 4$ dB of background suppression for optogenetic photostimulation. The light emitters, optimized for blue or amber light, combine end-fire optical phased arrays with slab gratings to suppress higher-order sidelobes.</description>

      <title>Unified laser stabilization and isolation on a silicon chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid progress in photonics has led to an explosion of integrated devices that promise to deliver the same performance as table-top technology at the nanoscale; heralding the next generation of optical communications, sensing and metrology, and quantum technologies. However, the challenge of co-integrating the multiple components of high-performance laser systems has left application of these nanoscale devices thwarted by bulky laser sources that are orders of magnitude larger than the devices themselves. Here we show that the two main ingredients for high-performance lasers -- noise reduction and isolation -- currently requiring serial combination of incompatible technologies, can be sourced simultaneously from a single, passive, CMOS-compatible nanophotonic device. To do this, we take advantage of both the long photon lifetime and the nonreciprocal Kerr nonlinearity of a high quality factor silicon nitride ring resonator to self-injection lock a semiconductor laser chip while also providing isolation. Additionally, we identify a previously unappreciated power regime limitation of current on-chip laser architectures which our system overcomes. Using our device, which we term a unified laser stabilizer, we demonstrate an on-chip integrated laser system with built-in isolation and noise reduction that operates with turnkey reliability. This approach departs from efforts to directly miniaturize and integrate traditional laser system components and serves to bridge the gap to fully integrated optical technologies.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-Scale Achromatic Hybrid Metalens Design: A New Paradigm Based on Differentiable Ray Tracing in the Visible Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single metalenses are limited by their physical constraints, precluding themselves from achieving high numerical aperture across a wide visible spectral band in large-aperture applications. A hybrid system that integrates a metalens with a refractive lens can address this issue, yet previous designs lacked sufficient flexibility. Here, by reanalyzing the generalized Snell's law, we introduce a new paradigm for the hybrid metalens design based on differentiable ray tracing. Through joint optimization of the phase distribution of the metalens and refractive lens parameters, our system achieves achromatic performance within the broad spectral range of 440-700 nm, with an aperture of 1 cm and an f-number of 1.4. Owing to the differentiable nature of the proposed system, it can be seamlessly integrated as the optical front-end into any differentiable computational imaging system. Our system offers unprecedented opportunities for the advancement of metalenses in innovative optical design and computational imaging domains.</description>

      <title>Size dependent photoemission study by electrochemical coarsening of nanoporous gold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and utilization of hot charge carriers in plasmonic materials have emerged as a topic of significant importance, with profound implications across multiple disciplines, including optoelectronics, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and sensing. In this study, we investigate the hot electron transfer from nanoporous gold (npAu) in dependence of the structure size, utilizing both the nanoscale feature size and the interconnected nature of this material. We employ photoelectron injection from nanoporous gold into the electrolyte under UV illumination as a test electron transfer process. Nanoporous gold thin films with sub-10 nm initial ligament diameter are stepwise coarsened by potential cycles in a photoelectrochemical setup, thereby allowing us to precisely probe the influence of ligament diameter on the photocurrent response. The resulting ligament diameter variations are confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. As the ligament diameter increased from 8 to 16 nm, there was a corresponding decrease in quantum efficiency proportional to the inverse ligament diameter squared. Such dependency is expected for electrons excited by surface collisions. For the small ligament diameter of 10 nm we estimate an emission efficiency of excited 6sp electrons as 3.14%, reaching 23% for the surface excited electrons.</description>

      <title>Recent Advancements in Mode Division Multiplexing for Communication and Computation in Silicon Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mode Division Multiplexing (MDM) is a technique used over the past decade in Silicon Photonics (SiPh) to incorporate more data into communication links by employing higher-order transverse electric or transverse magnetic modes. MDM was primarily used in optical communication; however, in recent years, there have been several applications of MDM in optical computing, including both classical and quantum computing. Although MDM has shown great promise for increasing the throughput of optical communication and the accuracy and fidelity of optical computation, there are a few challenges towards expanding its applications. One major challenge is the lack of process design kits (PDKs) and building block libraries compatible with standard SiPh foundries. Here, we present a comprehensive library of MDM components developed using classical and inverse design, compatible with standard 220 nm SiPh foundries. The library includes thermo-optic phase shifters, mode multiplexers and demultiplexers, mode converters, mode exchangers, and multi-mode interference couplers. We also discuss our recent achievements in MDM for datacom, classical and quantum optical computing, including a mode-selective switch for mode-reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexer (ROADM), multimode multiply-accumulate operation, and multimode photonic quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Steering nonlocality in high-speed telecommunication system without detection loophole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlocal correlation represents the key feature of quantum mechanics, which is exploited as a resource in quantum information processing. However, the loophole issues hamper the practical applications. We report the first demonstration of steering nonlocality with detection loophole closed at telecommunication wavelengths. In this endeavour, we design and fabricate a low-loss silicon chip for efficient entanglement generation, and further apply the direct modulation technique to its optical pump to eliminate phase-encoding loss at the steering side. The newly proposed phase-encoding measurement setting adapts to an ultra-fast modulation rate (GHz). Consequently, we build a fiber-optic setup that can overcome the detection efficiency that is required by quantum steering with multiple measurement settings. Our setup provides an immediate platform for exploring applications based on steering nonlocality, especially for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Bright Heralded Single-Photon Source with Ideal Purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate an unprecedentedly bright heralded single-photon source with ideal single-photon purity. The source is based on spontaneous four-wave mixing in silicon spiral waveguide excited by a pump with a repetition rate of 2.5 GHz. An explicit theoretical limit of purity of heralded single-photon source is derived, depending on Possoinian and thermal-like light pump, respectively. The measured coincidence counting rate exceeds 1.5 MHz, and the purity estimated by the second-order correlation function reaches the limit with a lowest value of 0.000945 (at a coincidence rate of 0.8 kHz), which has never been achieved by on-chip SFWM sources.</description>

      <title>OptoGPT: A Foundation Model for Inverse Design in Optical Multilayer Thin Film Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical multilayer thin film structures have been widely used in numerous photonic applications. However, existing inverse design methods have many drawbacks because they either fail to quickly adapt to different design targets, or are difficult to suit for different types of structures, e.g., designing for different materials at each layer. These methods also cannot accommodate versatile design situations under different angles and polarizations. In addition, how to benefit practical fabrications and manufacturing has not been extensively considered yet. In this work, we introduce OptoGPT (Opto Generative Pretrained Transformer), a decoder-only transformer, to solve all these drawbacks and issues simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Compressed Sensing of Field-resolved Molecular Fingerprints Beyond the Nyquist Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrashort time-domain spectroscopy and field-resolved spectroscopy of molecular fingerprints are gold standards for detecting samples' constituents and internal dynamics. However, they are hindered by the Nyquist criterion, leading to prolonged data acquisition, processing times, and sizable data volumes. In this work, we present the first experimental demonstration of compressed sensing on field-resolved molecular fingerprinting by employing random scanning. Our measurements enable pinpointing the primary absorption peaks of atmospheric water vapor in response to terahertz light transients while sampling beyond the Nyquist limit. By drastically undersampling the electric field of the molecular response at a Nyquist frequency of 0.8 THz, we could successfully identify water absorption peaks up to 2.5 THz with a mean squared error of 12 * 10^-4. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of time-domain compressed sensing, paving the path towards real-time field-resolved fingerprinting and acceleration of advanced spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>EventLFM: Event Camera integrated Fourier Light Field Microscopy for Ultrafast 3D imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast 3D imaging is indispensable for visualizing complex and dynamic biological processes. Conventional scanning-based techniques necessitate an inherent trade-off between acquisition speed and space-bandwidth product (SBP). Emerging single-shot 3D wide-field techniques offer a promising alternative but are bottlenecked by the synchronous readout constraints of conventional CMOS systems, thus restricting data throughput to maintain high SBP at limited frame rates. To address this, we introduce EventLFM, a straightforward and cost-effective system that overcomes these challenges by integrating an event camera with Fourier light field microscopy (LFM), a state-of-the-art single-shot 3D wide-field imaging technique. The event camera operates on a novel asynchronous readout architecture, thereby bypassing the frame rate limitations inherent to conventional CMOS systems. We further develop a simple and robust event-driven LFM reconstruction algorithm that can reliably reconstruct 3D dynamics from the unique spatiotemporal measurements captured by EventLFM. Experimental results demonstrate that EventLFM can robustly reconstruct fast-moving and rapidly blinking 3D fluorescent samples at kHz frame rates. Furthermore, we highlight EventLFM's capability for imaging of blinking neuronal signals in scattering mouse brain tissues and 3D tracking of GFP-labeled neurons in freely moving C. elegans. We believe that the combined ultrafast speed and large 3D SBP offered by EventLFM may open up new possibilities across many biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topology and criticality in photonic arrays with engineered losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated photonic systems provide a flexible platform where artificial lattices can be engineered in a reconfigurable fashion. Here, we show that one-dimensional photonic arrays with engineered losses allow the realization of topological excitations stemming from non-Hermiticity and bulk mode criticality. We show that a generalized modulation of the local photonic losses allows the creation of topological modes both in the presence of periodicity and even in the quasiperiodic regime. We demonstrate that a localization transition of all the bulk photonic modes can be engineered in the presence of a quasiperiodic loss modulation, and we further demonstrate that such a transition can be created in the presence of both resonance frequency modulation and loss modulation. We finally address the robustness of this phenomenology to the presence of next to the nearest neighbor couplings and disorder in the emergence of criticality and topological modes. Our results put forward a strategy to engineer topology and criticality solely from engineered losses in a photonic system, establishing a potential platform to study the impact of nonlinearities in topological and critical photonic matter.</description>

      <title>Ultrastable lasers: investigations of crystalline mirrors and closed cycle cooling at 124 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated crystalline AlGaAs/GaAs optical coatings with three ultra-stable cavities operating at 4 K, 16 K, 124 K and 297 K. The response of the resonance frequencies of cavities to variations in optical power indicates effects beyond the photo-thermo-optic effect observed in dielectric coatings. These effects are strongly dependent on the intensity of the intracavity light at 1.5~\textmu m. When the rear side of the mirrors is illuminated with external light, we observe a prominent photo-modified birefringence for photon energies above the GaAs bandgap, which points to a possible mechanism relating our observations to the semiconductor properties of the coatings. Separately, we also present a low maintenance evolution of our 124 K silicon cavity system where the liquid nitrogen based cooling system is replaced with closed cycle cooling from a pulse-tube cryo-cooler.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15217v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to entangle two cavity-magnon polaritons (CMPs) formed by two strongly coupled microwave cavity and magnon modes. This is realized by introducing vibration phonons, via magnetostriction, into the system that are dispersively coupled to the magnon mode. Stationary entanglement between two CMPs can be achieved when they are respectively resonant with the two sidebands of the drive field scattered by the phonons, and when the proportions of the cavity and magnon modes in the two polaritons are appropriately chosen. The entangled CMPs can improve the detection sensitivity in the dark matter search experiments using CMPs, and can also lead to the emission of frequency-entangled microwave photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emitter dephasing is one of the key issues in the performance of solid-state single photon sources. Among the various sources of dephasing, acoustic phonons play a central role in adding decoherence to the single photon emission. Here, we demonstrate, that it is possible to tune and engineer the coherence of photons emitted from a single WSe$_2$ monolayer quantum dot via selectively coupling it to a spectral cavity resonance. We utilize an open cavity to demonstrate spectral enhancement, leveling, and suppression of the highly asymmetric phonon sideband, finding excellent agreement with a microscopic description of the exciton-phonon dephasing in a truly two-dimensional system. Moreover, the impact of cavity tuning on the dephasing is directly assessed via optical interferometry, which points out the capability to utilize light-matter coupling to steer and design dephasing and coherence of quantum emitters in atomically thin crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences.However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.</description>

Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate the generation of enhanced optical springs using the optical Kerr effect. A nonlinear optical crystal is inserted into a Fabry-Perot cavity with a movable mirror, and a chain of second-order nonlinear optical effects in the phase-mismatched condition induces the Kerr effect. The optical spring constant is enhanced by a factor of $1.6\pm0.1$ over linear theory. To our knowledge, this is the first realization of optomechanical coupling enhancement using a nonlinear optical effect, which has been theoretically investigated to overcome the performance limitations of linear optomechanical systems. The tunable nonlinearity of demonstrated system has a wide range of potential applications, from observing gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron star post-merger remnants to cooling macroscopic oscillators to their quantum ground state.</description>

      <title>Passive and Deterministic Controlled-phase Gate for Single-photon Wavepackets Based on Time-reversal Symmetric Photon Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10719v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the construction of a passive, deterministic and near-unity-fidelity controlled-$\pi$-phase gate for single-photon wavepackets with a node comprising a two-level emitter and a small number of cavities. The proposed gate is rooted in the concept of time-reversal symmetric photon transport, which makes the entire photon transport process into a perfect absorption and re-emission process. Consequently, it can circumvent the longstanding issue of wavepacket distortion inherent in photonic phase gates employing nonlinear media. Moreover, such time-reversal symmetric transport ensures the nonlinear $\pi$ phase shift by a single two-level emitter for the two-photon case. We develop analytical solutions to reveal the temporal dynamics of the nonlinear photon transport and to optimize the gate structure. Notably, the gate fidelity can exceed 99\% for a node with only four cavities for both single-photon and two-photon operations. Moreover, the proposed gate architecture is compatible with the platforms of integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced mechanical rotation sensing using wavefront photonic gears</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum correlations for enhanced parameter estimation. Recently, structured light enabled increased resolution and sensitivity in quantum metrology systems. However, lossy and complex setups impacting photon flux, hinder true quantum advantage while using high dimensional structured light. We introduce a straightforward mechanical rotation quantum sensing mechanism, employing high-dimensional structured light and a compact high-flux (45,000 coincidence counts per second) N00N state source with N=2. The system utilizes two opposite spiral phase plates with topological charge of up to l=16 that convert mechanical rotation into wavefront phase shifts, and exhibit a 16-fold enhanced super-resolution and 25-fold enhanced sensitivity between different topological charges, while retaining the acquisition times and with negligible change in coincidence count. Furthermore, the high photon flux enables to detect mechanical angular acceleration in real-time. Our approach paves the way for highly sensitive quantum measurements, applicable to various interferometric schemes.</description>
