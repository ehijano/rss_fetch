      <title>Performance of Machine Learning Methods for Gravity Inversion: Successes and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravity inversion is the problem of estimating subsurface density distributions from observed gravitational field data. We consider the two-dimensional (2D) case, in which recovering density models from one-dimensional (1D) measurements leads to an underdetermined system with substantially more model parameters than measurements, making the inversion ill-posed and non-unique. Recent advances in machine learning have motivated data-driven approaches for gravity inversion. We first design a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to directly map gravity anomalies to density fields, where a customized data structure is introduced to enhance the inversion performance. To further investigate generative modeling, we employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), reformulating inversion as a latent-space optimization constrained by the forward operator. In addition, we assess whether classical iterative solvers such as Gradient Descent (GD), GMRES, LGMRES, and a recently proposed Improved Conjugate Gradient (ICG) method can refine CNN-based initial guesses and improve inversion accuracy. Our results demonstrate that CNN inversion not only provides the most reliable reconstructions but also significantly outperforms previously reported methods. Generative models remain promising but unstable, and iterative solvers offer only marginal improvements, underscoring the persistent ill-posedness of gravity inversion.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Prediction and Optimization of Open-Hole Wellbore Multiphysics Stability: A Synergistic PINN-DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the dual challenge of predicting multiphysics-induced instability and optimizing drilling fluid parameters for open-hole wellbores under long-term exposure, a high-fidelity system of coupled governing equations was developed. This system integrates seepage, hydration-induced softening, thermal diffusion, and elasto-plastic response to capture the nonlinear dynamics of wellbore stability evolution. A two-dimensional numerical model in a polar coordinate system was established using COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate multi-lithology and multi-parameter perturbations. This process generated a high-dimensional dataset characterizing the evolution of Von Mises stress, plastic strain, pore pressure, temperature, and water content, and its physical consistency was examined. Subsequently, the Seepage-Thermal-Water-Mechanical Physics-Informed Neural Network (STWM-PINN) is proposed. This model embeds governing equation residuals and initial-boundary constraints to achieve high-precision, physically consistent predictions of the wellbore's spatio-temporal evolution under the supervision of finite observational data, laying a foundation for parameter control. Building on this, a Double-Noise Soft Actor-Critic (DN-SAC) algorithm is integrated. A reward function was designed to minimize the probability of instability while considering control smoothness and physical boundary constraints, enabling continuous-space optimization of drilling fluid parameters. A case study demonstrates that the proposed method delays the onset of instability by an average of 32.33% and a maximum of 53.35%, significantly reducing instability risk. This study provides a decision-support framework with engineering application potential for intelligent wellbore instability prediction and drilling fluid control.</description>

      <title>Detection of Earth's free oscillations utilizing TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The measurement of Earth's free oscillations plays an important role in studying the Earth's large-scale structure. Space technology development presents a potential method to observe these normal modes by measuring inter-satellite distances. However, the disturbance from the Earth's low-degree gravity field makes it challenging for low Earth orbit gravity measurement satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TianQin-2 to extract signals from Earth's free oscillations directly. Here, we propose that by taking advantage of the high Earth orbit, the TianQin satellites can effectively avoid this disturbance, enabling direct measurement of Earth's free oscillations. We derive an analytical waveform to describe the response of Earth's free oscillations in TianQin. Based on this waveform, we use Bayesian analysis to extract the normal modes from numerical simulation data and perform parameter estimation. Our findings reveal that for a magnitude 7.9, Wenchuan-like earthquake, the resulting free oscillations will generate a signal that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 73 in TianQin, and approximately 9 different modes can be distinguished. This result shows TianQin can open a new window to examine the Earth's free oscillations and study the Earth's interior and earthquakes independently from ground-based gravity measurement.</description>

      <title>The impact of observation losses on IVS-R1/R4 VLBI sessions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global VLBI observations, to measure Earth orientation and station positions, are organised into 24-hour sessions. Each session has a bespoke schedule created, optimised for the particular time period and the station network that is available during it. Due to various factors, whether it be station outages, sensitivity issues or source effects, not all scheduled observations are available, or of sufficient quality, to be included in the final geodetic analysis. In this paper we derive statistics about the number of missing observations, as well as their effect on the expected precision of geodetic parameters such as station positions and Earth Orientation Parameters. We investigate the impact of observation loss on the weekly rapid turnaround IVS-R1 and IVS-R4 geodetic VLBI sessions over a decade period from 2014 - 2023. Across our 1030 sessions we find on average 25.3\% of observations scheduled do not make it to analysis. This results in median performance losses, when compared to the scheduled versions, of 18.8%, 19.2%, 12.1/11.3% and 28.7/22.9% for UT1-UTC, 3D station position, X/Y nutation and x/y polar motion respectively. We find that the estimation of X/Y nutation is particularly robust to typical observation loss seen from these 24-hour sessions. Conversely, we see high-rates of critical degradation in performance (a doubling of the scheduled repeatability) for other geodetic parameters at observations losses of between 15 - 19%, which is less than the median loss of 25.3% that we find across this 10-year period.</description>

      <title>Rethinking deep learning: linear regression remains a key benchmark in predicting terrestrial water storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications, demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the effects of preprocessing, method selection, and hyperparameter tuning on SAR-based flood mapping and water depth estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River (France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers. Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step and the hyperparameters of the methods.</description>
