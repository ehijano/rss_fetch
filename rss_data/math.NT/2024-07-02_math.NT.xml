      <title>Arithmetic properties for generalized cubic partitions and overpartitions modulo a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cubic partition is an integer partition wherein the even parts can appear in two colors. In this paper, we introduce the notion of generalized cubic partitions and prove a number of new congruences akin to the classical Ramanujan-type. We emphasize two methods of proofs, one elementary (relying significantly on functional equations) and the other based on modular forms. We close by proving analogous results for generalized overcubic partitions.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic multi-Stirling numbers of the second kind and probabilistic multi-Lah numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume that the moment generating function of the random vari able Y exists in a neighborhood of the origin. We introduce the probabilistic
  multi-Stirling numbers of the second kind associated with Y and the proba bilistic multi-Lah numbers associated with Y, both of indices (k1,k2,...,kr), by
  means of the multiple logarithm. Those numbers are respectively probabilistic
  extensions of the multi-Stirling numbers of the second kind and the multi-Lah
  numbers which, for (k1,k2,...,kr) = (1,1,...,1), boil down respectively to the
  Stirling numbers of the second and the unsigned Lah numbers. The aim of this
  paper is to study some properties, related identities, recurrence relations and
  explicit expressions of those probabilistic extension numbers in connection with
  several other special numbers</description>

      <title>A Rank-Two Case of Local-Global Compatibility for $l = p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the classical $l = p$ local-global compatibility conjecture for certain regular algebraic cuspidal automorphic representations of weight 0 for GL$_2$ over CM fields. Using an automorphy lifting theorem, we show that if the automorphic side comes from a twist of Steinberg at $v | l$, then the Galois side has nontrivial monodromy at $v$. Based on this observation, we will give a definition of the Fontaine-Mazur $\mathcal{L}$-invariants attached to certain automorphic representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monogenity is a classical area of algebraic number theory that continues to be actively researched. This paper collects the results obtained over the past few years in this area. Several of the listed results were presented at a series of online conferences titled "Monogenity and Power Integral Bases". We also give a collection of the most important methods used in several of these papers. A list of open problems for further research is also given.</description>

      <title>Multiple zeta values with varying constant fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple zeta values associated with function fields with varying constant fields are dealt with simultaneously. Thakur introduced multiple zeta values in the arithmetic of positive characteristic function fields, and the definition depends on the field of constants of the chosen function field. Using Papanikolas' theory on the relationship between the $t$-motivic Galois group and the periods of a pre-$t$-motive, we show that there exist no algebraic relations which relate multiple zeta values with different constants field.</description>

      <title>Monogenic trinomials of the form $x^4+ax^3+d$ and their Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(x)=x^4+ax^3+d\in {\mathbb Z}[x]$, where $ad\ne 0$. Let $C_n$ denote the cyclic group of order $n$, $D_4$ the dihedral group of order 8, and $A_4$ the alternating group of order 12. Assuming that $f(x)$ is monogenic, we give necessary and sufficient conditions involving only $a$ and $d$ to determine the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over ${\mathbb Q}$. In particular, we show that $G=D_4$ if and only if $(a,d)=(\pm 2,2)$, and that $G\not \in \{C_4,C_2\times C_2\}$. Furthermore, we prove that $f(x)$ is monogenic with $G=A_4$ if and only if $a=4k$ and $d=27k^4+1$, where $k\ne 0$ is an integer such that $27k^4+1$ is squarefree. This article extends previous work of the authors on the monogenicity of quartic polynomials and their Galois groups.</description>

      <title>Subspaces spanned by eigenforms with nonvanishing twisted central $L$-values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct explicit spanning sets for two spaces. One is the subspace generated by integral-weight Hecke eigenforms with nonvanishing quadratic twisted central $L$-values. The other is a subspace generated by half-integral weight Hecke eigenforms with certain nonvanishing Fourier coefficients. Along the way, we show that these subspaces are isomorphic via the Shimura lift.</description>

      <title>On canonical number systems and monogenity of pure number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $m$ be a rational integer $(m \neq 0, \pm 1)$ and consider a pure number field $K = \mathbb{Q} (\sqrt[n]{m}) $ with $n \ge 3$. Most papers discussing the monogenity of pure number fields focus only on the case where $m$ is square-free. In this paper, based on a classical theorem of Ore on the prime ideal decomposition \cite{MN92, O}, we study the monogenity of $K$ with $m$ is not necessarily square-free. As an application, several examples of the application of monogenic fields to CNS (Canonical Number System) are shown. In this way, our results extend some parts of previously established results \cite{BFC, BF, HNHCNS}.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Primitve Lattice Points in Large Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the distribution of primitive lattice points in a symmetric Borel set $S_d\subset\mathbb R^d$ as $d$ goes to infinity, under certain volume conditions on $S_d$. Our main technique involves exploring higher moment formulas for the primitive Siegel transform. We first demonstrate that if the volume of $S_d$ remains fixed for all $d\in \mathbb N$, then the distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Poisson distribution of mean $\frac 1 2$. Furthermore, if the volume of $S_d$ goes to infinity subexponentially as $d$ approaches infinity, the normalized distribution of the half the number of primitive lattice points in $S_d$ converges, in distribution, to the Normal distribution $\mathcal N(0,1)$. We also extend these results to the setting of stochastic processes. This work is motivated by the contributions of Rogers (1955), S$\ddot{\text{o}}$dergren (2011) and Str$\ddot{\text{o}}$mbergsson and S$\ddot{\text{o}}$dergren (2019).</description>

      <title>An Integral representation of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ due to Gabcke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gabcke proved a new integral expression for the auxiliary Riemann function \[\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)=2^{s/2}\pi^{s/2}e^{\pi i(s-1)/4}\int_{-\frac12\searrow\frac12} \frac{e^{-\pi i u^2/2+\pi i u}}{2i\cos\pi u}U(s-\tfrac12,\sqrt{2\pi}e^{\pi i/4}u)\,du,\] where $U(\nu,z)$ is the usual parabolic cylinder function.
  We give a new, shorter proof, which avoids the use of the Mordell integral. And we write it in the form \begin{equation}\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)=-2^s \pi^{s/2}e^{\pi i s/4}\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{e^{-\pi x^2}H_{-s}(x\sqrt{\pi})}{1+e^{-2\pi\omega x}}\,dx.\end{equation} where $H_\nu(z)$ is the generalized Hermite polynomial.</description>

      <title>Disproving a weaker form of Hooley's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hooley conjectured that $G(x;q) \ll x\log q$, as soon as $q\to +\infty$, where $G(x;q)$ represents the variance of primes $p \leq x$ in arithmetic progressions modulo $q$, weighted by $\log p$. In this paper, we study $G_\eta(x;q)$, a function similar to $G(x;q)$, but including the weighting factor $\eta\left(\frac{p}{x}\right)$, which has a dampening effect on the values of $G_\eta$. Our study is motivated by the disproof of Hooley's conjecture by Fiorilli and Martin in the range $q \asymp \log \log x$. Even though this weighting factor dampens the values, we still prove that an estimation of the form $G_\eta(x;q) \ll x\log q$ is false in the same range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth quasi-projective surface over a number field $K$, and let $L$ be a foliation on $X$. We prove that if $L$ is closed under $p$-th powers for almost all primes $p$, then any $L$-invariant smooth formal curve is $A$-analytic. Building on prior work of Bost we obtain an algebraicity criterion for those curves.</description>

      <title>The basis problem for modular forms for the Weil representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vector valued theta series of a positive-definite even lattice is a modular form for the Weil representation of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$. We show that the space of cusp forms for the Weil representation is generated by such functions. This gives a positive answer to Eichler's basis problem in this case. As applications we derive Waldspurger's result on the basis problem for scalar valued modular forms and give a new proof of the surjectivity of the Borcherds lift based on the analysis of local Picard groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute analogues of twisted traces of CM values of harmonic modular functions on hyperbolic $3$-space and show that they are essentially given by Fourier coefficients of the $j$-invariant. From this we deduce that the twisted traces of these harmonic modular functions are integers. Additionally, we compute the twisted traces of Eisenstein series on hyperbolic $3$-space in terms of Dirichlet $L$-functions and divisor sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how Rankin-Selberg periods interact with integral structures in spherical Whittaker type representations. Using this representation-theoretic framework, we show that the local Euler factors appearing in the construction of the motivic Rankin-Selberg Euler system for a product of modular forms are integrally optimal; i.e. any construction of this type with any choice of integral input data would give local factors appearing in tame norm relations at $p$ which are integrally divisible by the Euler factor $\mathcal{P}_p^{'}(\mathrm{Frob}_p^{-1})$ modulo $p-1$.</description>

Abstract: Let F be the function field of a curve over a complete discretely valued field K. Let G be a semisimple simply connected linear algebraic group over F of type An. We give a description of the obstruction to local global principle for principal homogeneous spaces under G over F with respect to discrete valuations of F in terms of R-equivalence classes of G over some suitable over fields. Using this description we prove that this obstruction vanishes under some conditions on the residue field K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite set of integers such that the first few gaps between its consecutive elements equal $a$, while the remaining gaps equal $b$, we study dense packings of its translates on the line. We obtain an explicit lower bound on the corresponding optimal density, conjecture its tightness, and prove it in case one of the gap lengths, $a$ or $b$, appears only once. This is equivalent to a Motzkin problem on the independence ratio of certain integer distance graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Beilinson--Bloch heights and Abel--Jacobian periods of homologically trivial Chow cycles in families. For the Beilinson--Bloch heights, we show that for any $g\ge 2$, there is a Zariski open dense subset $U$ of $\mathcal{M}_g$, the coarse moduli of curves of genus $g$ over rationals, such that the heights of Ceresa cycles and Gross--Schoen cycles over $U$ satisfy the Northcott property. For the Abel--Jacobi periods, we provide an algebraic criterion for the existence of a Zariski open dense subset of any family such that all cycles not defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ are non-torsion and verify that this criterion holds for Ceresa cycles and Gross--Schoen cycles.</description>

      <title>Tannakian fundamental groups of blended extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A_1, A_2,A_3$ be semisimple objects in a neutral tannakian category over a field of characteristic zero. Let $L$ be an extension of $A_2$ by $A_1$, and $N$ an extension of $A_3$ by $A_2$. Let $M$ be a blended extension (extension panach\'ee) of $N$ by $L$. Under very mild and natural hypotheses, we study the unipotent radical of the tannakian fundamental group of $M$. Examples where our results apply include the unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups of any mixed motive with three weights.
  As an application, we give a proof of the unipotent part of the Hodge-Nori conjecture for 1-motives (which is now a theorem of Andr\'e in the setting of Nori motives) in the setting of any tannakian category of motives where the group $Ext^1(1,\mathbb{Q}(1))$ is as expected.</description>

      <title>Tournament score sequences, Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers, and the L\'evy-Khintchine method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof of a recent result of Claesson, Dukes, Frankl\'in and Stef\'ansson, that connects tournament score sequences and the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv numbers from additive number theory. We show that this connection is, in fact, an instance of the L\'evy-Khintchine formula from probability theory, and highlight how such formulas can be useful in enumerative combinatorics. Our proof combines renewal theory with the representation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\H{o}s and Moser in the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a simpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic shifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already present in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968, and in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured that there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length $n$. Combining the arguments in the current work with those in a recent work by the third author, we demonstrate the utility of the L\'evy-Khintchine method, by giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical Bogomolov conjecture for families of split rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10455v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Zhang's dynamical Bogomolov conjecture holds uniformly along $1$-parameter families of rational split maps and curves. This provides dynamical analogues of recent results of Dimitrov-Gao-Habegger and K\"uhne. In fact, we prove a stronger Bogomolov-type result valid for families of split maps in the spirit of the relative Bogomolov conjecture. We thus provide first instances of a generalization of a conjecture by Baker and DeMarco to higher dimensions. Our proof contains both arithmetic and analytic ingredients. We establish a characterization of curves that are preperiodic under the action of a non-exceptional split rational endomorphism $(f,g)$ of $(\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathbb{C}})^2$ with respect to the measures of maximal entropy of $f$ and $g$, extending a previous result of Levin-Przytycki. We further establish a height inequality for families of split maps and varieties comparing the values of a fiber-wise Call-Silverman canonical height with a height on the base and valid for most points of a non-preperiodic variety. This provides a dynamical generalization of a result by Habegger and generalizes results of Call-Silverman and Baker to higher dimensions. In particular, we establish a geometric Bogomolov theorem for split rational maps and varieties of arbitrary dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we are interested in modular forms with non-vanishing central critical values and linear independence of Fourier coefficients of modular forms. The main ingredient is a generalization of a theorem due to VanderKam to modular symbols of higher weights. We prove that for sufficiently large primes $p$, Hecke operators $T_1, T_2, \ldots, T_D$ act linearly independently on the winding elements inside the space of weight $2k$ cuspidal modular symbol $\mathbb{S}_{2k}(\Gamma_0(p))$ with $k\geq 1$ for $D^2\ll p$. This gives a bound on the number of newforms with non-vanishing arithmetic $L$-functions at their central critical points and linear independence on the reductions of these modular forms for prime modulo $l\not=p$.</description>

      <title>An analogue of a conjecture of Rasmussen and Tamagawa for abelian varieties over function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a number field and let $\ell$ be a prime number. Rasmussen and Tamagawa conjectured, in a precise sense, that abelian varieties whose field of definition of the $\ell$-power torsion is both a pro-$\ell$ extension of $L(\mu_\ell)$ and unramified away from $\ell$ are quite rare. In this paper, we formulate an analogue of the Rasmussen--Tamagawa conjecture for non-isotrivial abelian varieties defined over function fields. We provide a proof of our analogue in the case of elliptic curves. In higher dimensions, when the base field is a subfield of the complex numbers, we show that our conjecture is a consequence of the uniform geometric torsion conjecture. Finally, using a theorem of Bakker and Tsimerman we also prove our conjecture unconditionally for abelian varieties with real multiplication.</description>

Abstract: For an isotropic subgroup $H$ of a discriminant form $D$ there exists a lift from modular forms for the Weil representation of the discriminant form $H^\bot/H$ to modular forms for the Weil representation of $D$. We determine a set of discriminant forms such that all modular forms for any discriminant form are induced from the discriminant forms in this set. Furthermore for any discriminant form in this set there exist modular forms that are not induced from smaller discriminant forms.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be an abelian variety defined over a field $K.$ We study finite generation properties of the profinite group $\mathrm{Gal}(\Omega/K)$ and of certain closed normal subgroups thereof, where $\Omega$ is the torsion field of $A$ over $K$. In fact, we establish more general finite generation properties for monodromy groups attached to smooth projective varieties via \'etale cohomology. We apply this in order to give an independent proof and generalizations of a recent result of Checcoli and Dill about small exponent subfields of $\Omega/K$ in the number field case. We also give an application of our finite generation results in the realm of permanence principles for varieties with the weak Hilbert property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the characteristic-$p$ fibers of $\mathsf{GU}(q-2,2)$ Shimura varieties, which classify abelian varieties with additional structure. These Shimura varieties admit two stratifications of interest: the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, based on the isomorphism class of the $p$-torsion subgroup scheme, and the Newton stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group. It is natural to ask which Ekedahl-Oort strata intersect the unique closed Newton stratum, called the supersingular locus. In this paper, we present several novel techniques that give information about the interaction between the two stratifications for general signature $(q-2,2)$, and as an application, we completely answer this question for the signature $(3,2)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denote by $J_m$ the Jacobian variety of the hyperelliptic curve defined by the affine equation $y^2=x^m+1$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, where $m \geq 3$ is a fixed positive integer. We compute several interesting arithmetic invariants of $J_m$: its decomposition up to isogeny into simple abelian varieties, the minimal field $\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$ over which its endomorphisms are defined, its connected monodromy field $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})$, and its Sato-Tate group. Currently, there is no general algorithm that computes these last two invariants. Furthermore, for large enough values of $m$, the abelian varieties $J_m$ provide non-trivial examples of high-dimensional phenomena, such as degeneracy and the non-triviality of the extension $\mathbb{Q}(\varepsilon_{J_m})/\mathbb{Q}(\operatorname{End}(J_m))$. We also describe the Sato-Tate group of an abelian variety, generalizing existing results that apply only to non-degenerate varieties, and prove an extension of a well-known formula of Gross-Koblitz that relates values of the classical and $p$-adic gamma functions at rational arguments.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative largeness of $\textit{de Polignac numbers}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A number $m$ is said to be a $\textit{de Polignac number}$, if infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes exist, such that $m$ can be written as the difference of those consecutive prime numbers. Recently in [ W. D. Banks: Consecutive primes and IP sets, arXiv:2403.10637.], using arguments from the Ramsey theory, W. D. Banks proved that the collection of $\textit{de Polignac number}$ is an $IP^\star$ set (Though his original statement is relatively weaker, an iterative application of pigeonhole principle/ theory of ultrafilters shows that this statement is sufficient to conclude the set is $IP^\star$). As a consequence, we have this collection as an additively syndetic set. In this article, we show that this collection is also a multiplicative syndetic set. In our proof, we use combinatorial arguments and the tools from the algebra of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of discrete semigroups (for details see [N. Hindman, and D. Strauss: Algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech Compactification: Theory and Applications, second edition, de Gruyter, Berlin,2012.]).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a combinatorial structure of orthogeodesics on hyperbolic surfaces and presents several relations among them. As a primary application, we propose a recursive method for computing the trace (the hyperbolic cosine of the length) of orthogeodesics and establish the existence of surfaces where the trace of each orthogeodesic is an integer. These surfaces and their orthogeodesics are closely related to integral Apollonian circle packings. Notably, we found a new type of root-flipping that transitions between roots in different quadratic Diophantine equations of a certain type, with Vieta root-flipping as a special case. Finally, we provide a combinatorial proof of Basmajian's identity for hyperbolic surfaces, akin to Bowditch's combinatorial proof of the McShane identity.</description>

Abstract: Let $F$ be a non-archimedean local field, $A$ be a central simple $F$-algebra, and $G$ be the multiplicative group of $A$. To construct types for supercuspidal representations of $G$, simple types by S\'echerre and Yu's construction are already known. In this paper, we compare these constructions. In particular, we show essentially tame supercuspidal representations of $G$ defined by Bushnell-Henniart are nothing but tame supercuspidal representations defined by Yu.</description>

Abstract: We define an enrichment of the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function of a variety over a finite field to a power series with coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group. We show that this enrichment is related to the topology of the real points of a lift. For cellular schemes over a field, we prove a rationality result for this enriched logarithmic derivative of the zeta function as an analogue of part of the Weil conjectures. We also compute several examples, including toric varieties, and show that the enrichment is a motivic measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let k be a field finitely generated over its prime subfield. We prove that the quotient of the Brauer group of a product of varieties over k by the Brauer groups of factors has finite exponent. The bulk of the proof concerns p-primary torsion in characteristic p. Our approach gives a more direct proof of the boundedness of the p-primary torsion of the Brauer group of an abelian variety, as recently proved by D'Addezio. We show that the transcendental Brauer group of a Kummer surface over k has finite exponent, but can be infinite when k is an infinite field of positive characteristic. This answers a question of Zarhin and the author.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes an interesting connection between the family of CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E_1^3$ and some specific families of elliptic curves. As a consequence of this connection, we show in the class of spacelike CMC surfaces of revolution in the $\mathbb E_1^3$, only spacelike cylinders and standard hyperboloids are algebraic. We also show that a similar connection exists between CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ and elliptic curves. Further, we use this to reestablish the fact that the only CMC algebraic surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ are spheres and right circular cylinders.</description>
