      <title>A background for thermal photons in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the transverse momentum spectra of prompt and decay photons in Au-Au collisions for $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 200 GeV, 62.4 GeV, 39 GeV, and 27 GeV. The major sources of the photons in Angantyr include hard processes, Parton showers, and resonance decay. The multiparton interactions and hadronic rescatterings significantly increase the photon yield. The model shows a good match with the available experimental data at high $p_T$. The difference in yield at low $p_T $ suggests that Quark Gluon Plasma of $T_{eff}$ = 0.167 GeV/c in central Au-Au collision at 200 GeV is formed, the new effective temperature is less than the ones extracted without removing background photons. At low $p_T$ the decay photon spectra scales with $(\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta})^{1.25}$, the scaling is independent of collision energy and system size. The scaling no longer holds at high $p_T$ and the spectra become beam energy dependent. The scaled $p_T$ spectra of p-p and d-Au collisions show an opposite trend at high $p_T$, their scaled yield is greater than the Au-Au collision at the same energy.</description>

      <title>Study of the Involvement of $^8$Be and $^9$B Nuclei in the Dissociation of Relativistic $^{10}$C, $^{10}$B, and $^{12}$C Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results obtained by estimating the contribution of $^8$Be and $^9$B nuclei to the coherent dissociation of $^{10}$C, $^{10}$B, and $^{12}$C relativistic nuclei in nuclear track emulsions (``white'' stars) are presented. The selection of ``white'' stars accompanied by $^9$B leads to a distinct peak appearing in the distribution of the excitation energy of 2$\alpha$2$p$ ensembles and having a maximum at 4.1 $\pm$ 0.3 MeV. A $^8$Be nucleus manifests itself in the coherent-dissociation reaction $^{10}$B $\to$ 2He + H with a probability of (25 $\pm$ 5)\%, (14 $\pm$ 3)\% of it being due to $^9$B decays. The ratio of the branching fractions of the $^9$B + $n$ and $^9$Be + $p$ mirror channels is estimated at 6 $\pm$ 1. An analysis of the relativistic dissociation of $^{12}$C nuclei in a nuclear track emulsion revealed nine 3$\alpha$ events corresponding to the Hoyle state.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>

      <title>Use of quantality in nuclei and many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of quantality is discussed in the case of nuclei and other many-body systems such as atomic electrons. This dimensionless quantity is known to indicate when a many-body system behaves like a crystal or a quantum liquid. Its role is further analyzed by showing its relation to the scattering length. The emergence of a fundamental lengthscale, the limit radius, is also shown. It corresponds to the hard-core of the nucleon-nucleon interaction in the case of nucleons, and to a value close to the Bohr radius in the case of atomic electrons. The occurrence of a cluster phase in nuclei is analyzed using the quantality through its relation to the localization parameter, allowing for the identification of both the number of nucleons and the density as control parameters for the occurrence of this phase. The relation of the quantality to the magnitude of the interaction also exhibits a third dimensionless parameter, monitoring the magnitude of the spin-orbit effect in finite systems, through the realization of the pseudo-spin symmetry. The impact of quantality on the spin-orbit effect is compared in various many-body systems. The role of quantality in the relative effect of the binding energy and the shell one is also analyzed in nuclei. Finally, additional dimensionless quantities are proposed from the generalization of the quantality. Nuclei are found to be exceptional systems because all their dimensionless quantities are close to the order of unity, at variance with other many-body systems.</description>
