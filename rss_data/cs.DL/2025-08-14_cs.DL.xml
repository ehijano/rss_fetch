      <title>AI Blob! LLM-Driven Recontextualization of Italian Television Archives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547 Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By foregrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI Blob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to archival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction and cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media historiography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual framework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary experimentation.</description>

      <title>Quo Vadis Handwritten Text Generation for Handwritten Text Recognition?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to low-resource HTR.</description>

      <title>Rxiv-Maker: an automated template engine for streamlined scientific publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preprint servers accelerate research dissemination, but authors still face complex manuscript preparation without professional typesetting support. Rxiv-Maker enables researchers to create documents using a framework that converts Markdown into publication-standard PDFs. It automatically translates the markdown text into LaTeX, so researchers don't have to write any LaTeX code themselves. This tool transforms simple documents into dynamic, version-controlled files that work well with modern team collaboration and ongoing updates. Rxiv-Maker executes Python and R scripts for on-the-fly figure generation, ensuring visualisations stay current with data and analyses. Automated build environments, Docker support, and built-in citation and cross-reference management ensure reliable, reproducible builds across systems, while the conversion process handles mathematical equations and formatting. Rxiv-Maker simplifies professional typesetting, promoting clear and open scientific publishing. This manuscript showcases Rxiv-Maker's capabilities, serving as a testament to its elegance in action.</description>

      <title>Citation Issues in Wave Mechanics Theory of Microwave Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The wave mechanics theory of microwave absorption challenges the long-standing impedance-matching and quarter-wavelength paradigms by demonstrating that conventional models mistakenly conflate bulk material parameters with thin-film phenomena. Drawing on a corpus of 35 peer-reviewed papers and preprints, the study performs a citation-pattern analysis and a logical audit of established theory. Results reveal a striking asymmetry in scholarly engagement, only a handful of supportive or neutral citations appear amid widespread silence, alongside critical logical flaws in impedance matching, notably its inconsistent treatment of penetration, reflection, and absorption from film. By re-framing absorption as a wave-mechanics process governed by interference at parallel interfaces, the wave mechanics framework restores energy-conservation consistency and provides experimentally verified design rules for film thickness, phase response, and broadband performance. The paper further situates the citation neglect within broader issues of peer-review bias and paradigm inertia, illustrating how cargo-cult scientific practices can impede theoretical progress. Recommendations are offered for researchers, editors, and institutions to foster open discourse, rigorously test competing models, and update curricula and design tools accordingly.</description>
