      <title>Chemical evolution of close massive binaries -- tidally-enhanced or tidally-suppressed mixing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the largest source of uncertainties in the predictions of stellar models comes from the internal transport mechanisms. In close massive binaries, previous theoretical studies suggest that tides systematically boost chemical mixing. However, observations do not reveal any clear period-nitrogen enrichment trend, challenging these predictions. In addition, comprehensive examinations of the interplay between tidal interactions, angular momentum and chemicals transport have so far been scarce. We investigate the interplay between tidal interactions and rotational mixing, and the impact of the angular moment transport (AMT) assumptions. We examine whether tidal interactions enhance or suppress chemical mixing by computing grids of genec binary models with various AMT treatments. In order to independently assess the role of tidal interactions, we systematically compute model variations of single stars with identical initial conditions. Our investigations reveal that tides can either enhance or suppress mixing relative to single-star models, and that the outcome is highly sensitive to the AMT assumptions. We identify a key contrast between the two types of computed models: in close systems subject to tides, magnetic models predict that the mixing efficiency is mostly determined by the orbital configuration, whereas in hydrodynamic models it also depends on the assumed initial velocity. As a result, hydro models may display non-monotonic period-enrichment trends, or even period-enrichment correlations. These results highlight the importance of the AMT assumptions in modeling binaries with tidal interactions. The sensitivity of the predictions of hydro models to initial conditions extends the size of the period-enrichment parameter space they cover, allowing them to accommodate for peculiar observed systems, i.e., with mild enrichment at short periods, or high enrichment at longer periods.</description>

      <title>A Not-So-Compact Companion: Massive, Oversize White Dwarf in a Post-Common Envelope Eclipsing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14378v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a detailed characterization of 2M07515777+1807352, a post-common envelope eclipsing binary system with a 10.3 d, nearly, but not quite, circular orbit (e = 0.02). This system consists of a massive white dwarf (WD) ($1.08$ M$_{\odot}$) and a 4400 K main-sequence companion (0.66 M$_{\odot}$). This WD is among the most massive known within post-common envelope binary systems. We also find, through both spectral energy distribution and $\it{TESS}$ light curve analyses, that the WD has a radius of $1.54\pm 0.07 R_{\oplus}$, roughly $12\sigma$ larger than the expected value from WD mass-radius relationships. Both the Lomb-Scargle analysis and the $v \sin{i}$ of the system indicate the main-sequence companion to be super-synchronously rotating at a period of $\sim$6 days, which may suggest accretion occurred during the evolution of the system. This binary also shares similar physical characteristics with six other post-common envelope systems hosting massive WDs, which may point to a shared formation pathway. We model the history of this system with COSMIC and find that it likely formed through an episode of common envelope evolution following the onset of mass transfer when the progenitor primary was on either the early or the thermally pulsing stages of the asymptotic giant branch. As a result of its properties, the study of 2M07515777+1807352 can provide new insights regarding many key outstanding questions in our understanding of common envelope evolution.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet spectroscopy reveals a hot and luminous companion to the Be star + black hole candidate MWC 656</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Be star binary MWC 656 was long considered the only known Be star + black hole (BH) system, making it a critical benchmark for models of massive binary evolution and for the expected X-ray emission of Be+BH binaries. However, recent dynamical measurements cast doubt on the presence of a BH companion. We present new multi-epoch ultraviolet spectroscopy from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), combined with high-resolution optical spectra, to reassess the nature of the companion. The far-ultraviolet spectra reveal high-ionisation features, including prominent N V and He II lines, which are absent in the spectra of normal Be stars and are indicative of a hot, luminous companion. Spectral modelling shows that these features cannot originate from the Be star or from an accretion disc around a compact object. Instead, we find that the data are best explained by a hot ($T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 85$ kK), compact, hydrogen-deficient star with strong wind signatures, consistent with an intermediate-mass stripped star. Our revised orbital solution and composite spectroscopic modelling yield a companion mass of $M_2 = 1.54^{+0.57}_{-0.46}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, definitively ruling out a BH and disfavouring a white dwarf. MWC 656 thus joins the growing class of Be + stripped star binaries. The system's unusual properties - including a high companion temperature and wind strength - extend the known parameter space of such binaries. The continued absence of confirmed OBe+BH binaries in the Galaxy highlights a growing tension with population synthesis models.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Radial Velocities from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations and Implications for Astrometric Acceleration Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry from the Gaia satellite and from the long-term combination of Hipparcos and Gaia are now sensitive to sky-plane accelerations as low as $\approx$1 m/s/yr. This paper quantifies and explores an important caveat: apparent nonlinear motion due to a star's nonzero radial velocity can be indistinguishable from real astrometric acceleration. This nonlinear motion is parallel to the proper motion, so it can be both quantified and avoided by projecting apparent astrometric accelerations into components parallel and perpendicular to the proper motion. We illustrate this distinction for a sample of very nearby, fast-moving stars from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). We then generalize the effect of stellar radial velocity and projections of the astrometric acceleration to binary stars in which we observe the acceleration of both components. Finally, we demonstrate that the proper motion differences in the HGCA are statistically well-behaved even for the nearest and fastest-moving stars, at least in the component perpendicular to the proper motion. This distinction -- between astrometric acceleration parallel and perpendicular to proper motion -- could have important consequences for future missions reaching extreme astrometric sensitivities around nearby stars.</description>

      <title>Extra modes in helium-core-burning stars probing an infra core cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipole mixed modes observed in the oscillation pattern of red giant stars probe the radiative regions in the stellar core. Oscillation spectra of helium-core-burning stars sometimes show extra peaks that remain unexplained by the dipole mixed-mode pattern expected from the coupling of a radiative cavity in the stellar core and a pressure cavity in the stellar envelope. We use the asymptotic expansion developed for a multi-cavity star in order to characterize these extra peaks. The analytical resonance condition of the multi-cavity gravito-acoustic modes, with two inner gravity cavities and an outer pressure cavity, helps us explain that the apparent extra peaks are dipole mixed modes that follow the 3-cavity oscillation pattern. The derivation of the two asymptotic period spacings associated with the two distinct regions in the radiative core provides an estimate of the full radiative cavity. Our results provide new constraints for analysing the overshoot or mixing in the core of helium-core-burning stars. An important structure discontinuity inside the radiative core may explain the larger than expected observed period spacings.</description>

      <title>Spectral Variability of the Star HD 141569A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the results of long-term homogeneous spectroscopic studies of the Herbig Ae/Be star HD 141569A obtained in the optical range. We detect spectral variability on timescales of months to years, including changes in the spectrophotometric parameters of the Halpha emission line, as well as other hydrogen absorption lines. Based on the derived physical parameters and age, the star appears to be in a transitional evolutionary stage from a protoplanetary disk to a debris disk. We determine that the star axial rotation period is approximately 12 hours, and its equatorial velocity is significantly below the critical rotation velocity. The observed spectral variability is likely caused by partial obscuration of the central star radiation by extended fragments of the disrupted disk.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Radially Varying Diffusivities on Stellar Convection Zone Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convection is ubiquitous in stellar and planetary interiors where it likely plays an integral role in the generation of magnetic fields. As the interiors of these objects remain hidden from direct observation, numerical models of convection are an important tool in the study of astrophysical dynamos. In such models, unrealistic large values of the viscous ($\nu$) and thermal ($\kappa$) diffusivity are routinely used as an ad-hoc representation of the effects of subgrid scale turbulence which is otherwise too small-scale to resolve numerically. However, the functional forms of these diffusion coefficients can vary greatly between studies, complicating efforts to compare between results and against observations. We explore this issue by considering a series of non-rotating, non-magnetic, solar-like convection models with varying radial functions for the diffusivities and differing boundary conditions. We find that the bulk kinetic energy scales similarly regardless of the diffusivity parameterization. This scaling is consistent with a free-fall scaling, wherein viscosity plays a subdominant role in the force balance. We do not, however, observe such diffusion-free behavior in the convective heat transport. Our results also indicate that the functional form adopted for the diffusion coefficients can impact the distribution of turbulence within the convective shell. These results suggest that some care should be taken when comparing solar convection models directly against helioseismic observations.</description>

      <title>SETI Observations of k-Hz Periodic Radio Signals from Five Nearby Stars with FAST at L Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a radio SETI search for periodic, kHz-wide signals from five of the nearest stars observable with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Using the 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz), we obtained 1200 s tracking observations of Groombridge 34 A/B, Ross 248, 61 Cygni B, and Ross 128. Dynamic spectra from all beams and both linear polarisations were searched channel by channel with a fast-folding algorithm sensitive to periods between 1.1 and 300 s. A multi-layer RFI-mitigation pipeline exploits multi-beam occupancy, cross-target bad-channel statistics, XX/YY polarisation coincidence, broad frequency masks, and narrow site-specific RFI exclusion zones, followed by clustering in period-frequency space. The pipeline is validated on FAST observations of PSR B0329+54, where we recover the known 0.714 s spin period and harmonic structure in the expected beam. For the stellar sample, successive cuts reduce the raw FFA hit lists (&gt; 10^6 hits per target) to a small number of cluster-level candidates, all of which exhibit clear radio-frequency interference signatures in phase-time and phase-frequency diagnostics. We therefore report no convincing detections of periodic transmitters in our searched parameter space. Using the radiometer equation with our adopted detection threshold (S/N = 25) and assuming a duty cycle delta = 0.1, we obtain upper limits of approximately (7-9) x 10^9 W on the isotropic-equivalent EIRP of kHz-wide periodic beacons at these stars, among the most stringent constraints to date on periodic radio emission from nearby stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Statistical Relations Between Projected Separation, Semimajor Axis, Companion Mass, and Host Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I derive the statistical relationship between a radial velocity or astrometric acceleration (a trend), a companion's mass, and the projected separation of the companion. These relationships, expressed as probability density functions, are analytic and independent of all Keplerian orbital elements so long as orbits are randomly oriented in space. I also derive a closed-form expression for the probability distribution of the ratio of the projected separation to the semimajor axis at fixed eccentricity. This expression can be numerically integrated over eccentricity for an arbitrary distribution of eccentricities. I verify my results with empirical comparisons to equivalent but more complex expressions in the literature based on the equations of Keplerian orbits. The closed-formed expressions derived here would be especially useful for any calculation that requires derivatives, e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. I also provide a Jupyter notebook including all figures and calculations.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of multiple solar flare induced modulation of Very Low Frequency (VLF) diurnal profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's ionosphere is a perpetual detector of ionizing radiation received from celestial objects, particularly the Sun. Solar ionizing radiation in the form of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-rays during both quiet and active phase of the Sun, and charged particles associated with a solar wind imprint their ionization signatures on the ionosphere. Although due to the bipolar nature of the geomagnetic field, the events, such as the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar wind enhancement, usually disturb the polar ionosphere only, the UV and X-rays from the solar flares produce sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) in low-mid-latitude part of the earth's ionosphere. Such ionospheric disturbances are studied with the help of the influence they exert on radio waves propagating through earth-ionosphere waveguide. For the lower part of the ionosphere, called the D region, prominent modification in electron-ion density during solar flares can be observed via deviation in earth bound Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave signal from its ambient diurnal profile. In earlier work, successful model of the deviation in VLF amplitude due to different classes of solar flares was formulated. There, calculation of rate of ionization with Monte Carlo simulation and ion-chemistry evaluation of plasma density enhancement followed by a radio propagation simulation was used. Presently, we attempt to numerically reconstruct the modulation in VLF signal from its diurnal pattern produced by multiple solar flares occurring over a single day. Successful reconstruction of the VLF signal modulation for such a complex flaring scenario points to the accuracy of our understanding of the ionization effect due to solar activity on the lower ionosphere, and strengthen our claim to use earth's ionosphere as a high energy space transient event detector.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Archeology of White Dwarfs. Revisiting the fossil field scenario with observational constraints during the red giant branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of strong, large-scale magnetic fields at the surface of only the oldest population of white dwarfs might point towards a hidden internal magnetic field slowly rising to the surface. In addition, strong magnetic fields have recently been measured through asteroseismology in the radiative interiors of red giant stars, the progenitors of white dwarfs. To investigate the potential connection between these observations, we revisit the fossil field framework by using the asteroseismic detections to constrain the strength of such magnetic fields as they evolve to the white dwarf stage. We assume that the magnetic field was either created during the main sequence core convection or that it fills the radiative interior as the star evolves on the red giant branch. From these, we evolve the magnetic flux, allowing for magnetic diffusion along the evolution of a 1.5Msun modelled star. We find that measured field strengths in red giants attributed to the hydrogen-burning shell are compatible with the field amplitudes and emergence timescales of magnetized white dwarfs. On the contrary, magnetic fields generated solely from a convective-core dynamo on the main-sequence and detectable during the red giant branch would be buried too deep in the star and not match the breakout timescales and the field strengths of magnetic white dwarfs. A broadly magnetized internal radiative zone during the red giant branch is therefore key for the fossil field theory to connect magnetic fields observed along the late evolution of stars.</description>

Abstract: Detecting small planets via the radial velocity method remains challenged by signals induced by stellar variability, versus the effects of the planet(s). Here, we explore using Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry in modeling radial velocities (RVs) to help to mitigate stellar jitter from oscillations and granulation for exoplanet detection. We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\star=1.09M_{\odot}$, $R_\star=1.88R_{\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD~5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset. For long baseline and high-cadence RV observations, GP regression can effectively mitigate stellar jitter without photometric data. However, for intermittent RV observations, incorporating photometric data improves GP fitting and enhances detection capabilities.</description>

Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\% but not more than 70\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.</description>

      <title>Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</title>

Abstract: The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at ~0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B~3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is ~5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</description>

      <title>Erythrohenosis -- The crimson chronicles of two giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate erythrohenosis -- the collision and merger of two red giants -- establishing an end-to-end model for this fundamental evolutionary channel in dense stellar environments. Combining three-dimensional SPH simulations of a binary with analytical modeling, we characterize the event from initial encounter to terminal explosion. We demonstrate that grazing encounters induce tidal capture and rapid orbital decay, accompanied by large-amplitude, nonlinear stellar oscillations. The subsequent inspiral spins up the common envelope into a stable, non-spherical equilibrium, powering a luminous precursor with quasi-periodic bursts. The terminal explosion, modeled with angular momentum conservation, produces an intrinsically flattened remnant that preserves a geometric memory, or morphomnesia, of its binary origin. The associated gravitational wave signal features a rapid, drag-dominated frequency evolution, identifiable by a unique time-varying apparent chirp mass. These results define a distinctive multi-stage observational fingerprint -- linking transient optical precursors, asymmetric nebulae, and anomalous gravitational wave chirps -- to guide identification in current and future multi-messenger surveys.</description>

      <title>Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.
  The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.
  The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant.
  The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.
  The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.
  This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</description>

      <title>How a Close-in Planet Protects its White Dwarf Host from Pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximately 25-50% of white dwarfs (WDs) exhibit metal absorption lines in their photospheres, which are attributed to accretion from their remnant planetary systems. Although white dwarfs with detected planetary systems are more likely to show photospheric pollution, one notable exception - WD 1856+534 - hosts a close-in giant planet yet exhibits no detectable photospheric metal pollution. Previous studies have proposed that massive, close-in planets can block inward transport of small particles driven by radiative forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect). However, it remains unclear whether the close-in planet can similarly prevent delivery of larger bodies via dynamical interactions. We aim to quantify the protective influence of close-in planets on white-dwarf pollution by asteroids approaching on near-parabolic orbits, and to explore the planetary masses and orbital separations required to provide effective protection. We perform ensembles of short-term N-body integrations, sampling a range of planet masses and orbital separations and initializing asteroids on highly eccentric orbits with periapses near the WD Roche radius, in order to measure scattering, capture, and ejection outcomes and quantify the planet's shielding efficiency. For WD1856+534b-like configurations (a_p = 0.02 au), giant planets with masses greater than 0.5 Jupiter masses are sufficient to clear over 80% of highly eccentric small-body contaminants. The effectiveness of the protective effect diminishes with decreasing planetary mass and increasing semi-major axis. These findings help explain why some white dwarfs that host close-in giant planets do not show the photospheric metal pollution commonly observed in other systems.</description>

      <title>The Circumbinary Disk of HD 34700A: I. CO gas kinematics indicate spirals, infall, and vortex motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.14") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.</description>

Abstract: Solar flares are the most powerful, magnetically driven, explosions in the heliosphere. The nature of magnetic energy release in the solar corona that heats the plasma and accelerates particles in a flare, however, remains poorly understood. Here, we report high-resolution coronal observations of a flare by the Solar Orbiter mission that reveal initially weaker but rapid reconnection events, on timescales of a few seconds at most, leading to a more prominent activity of a similar nature that explosively causes a flare. Signatures of this process are further imprinted on the widespread raining plasma blobs with short lifetimes, giving rise to the characteristic ribbon-like emission pattern associated with the flare. Our observations unveil the central engine of a flare and emphasize the crucial role of an avalanche-like magnetic energy release mechanism at work.</description>

      <title>A binary-related origin mediated by environmental conditions for blue straggler stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blue stragglers are anomalously massive core hydrogen-burning stars that, according to the theory of single star evolution, should not exist. They are suspected to form in mass-enhancement processes, involving binary evolution or stellar collisions. In dynamically active systems like globular clusters, the number of blue stragglers originated by collisions is expected to increase with the local density and the rate of stellar encounters. Here we analyse more than 3000 blue stragglers in 48 Galactic globular clusters with different structures, finding that their number normalized to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the central density, collision rate, and dynamical age of the parent cluster. Similar trends are also found for the cluster binary fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1 M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8 M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources (i.e., sources lying blueward of the main sequence) in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the completeness and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. For the SMC and LMC, we respectively recover 31\% and 15\% of sources with intrinsic UV excess, and $11\%$ and $7\%$ of all stripped stars. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, high extinction, and limited survey coverage. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and systems with compact object companions. We predict contamination of the observed stripped-star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. Our population synthesis model matches the number and properties of observed stripped star candidates with masses of $(2-5) M_\odot$ well. It underpredicts the number of lower- and higher-mass candidates, perhaps due to contamination.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field generation in mergers of massive main sequence stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are found in many astrophysical objects, ranging from galaxy clusters to the interstellar medium of galaxies and neutron stars. Strong magnetic fields are also observed in massive stars, but it is still unclear how they are generated. There are different theories for their origin: the magnetic fields could be fossil fields from star formation, they could be generated in dynamo processes during stellar evolution, or they could be generated during a merger of two stars. Here, we show how magnetic fields are generated in simulations of mergers of massive main-sequence stars, conducted with the 3D magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO. In these simulations, a $9\,M_\odot$ and a $8\,M_\odot$ main sequence star merge, whereby the more massive star transfers mass to the less massive one until it is finally disrupted, forming a core-disk structure. During the initial mass transfer, magnetic fields start to be amplified in the accretion stream, saturating after the disruption at an equipartition level. Correspondingly, the magnetic energy starts being present at small scales, growing to larger scales during the merger. During the merger, the magnetic pressure is much smaller than the gas pressure, thus the dynamical impact of the magnetic fields on the merger is small. After the merger, both are similar in some regions, and the magnetic field shows a large-scale structure that is mostly toroidal and that is expected to be stable. Thus, our simulations show that magnetic fields in massive stars can originate from a merger of two main sequence stars.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries</title>

Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the self-consistent formation and long-term evolution of proton beams in the expanding solar wind using an ensemble of one-dimensional hybrid expanding box simulations. Initial conditions are chosen to represent a range of plasma states observed by the Helios spacecraft at 0.3 AU, including an amplitude-modulated Alfv\'en wave that nonlinearly drives a proton beam aligned with the magnetic field. We compare simulation results with solar wind data out to 1.5 AU and show that our model reproduces key observed features of proton beams on average, such as the radial evolution of the drift and the relative core-to-beam density ratio. These findings support the theory that the observed evolution of the proton beam drift in the solar wind is determined by kinetic instabilities. More broadly, our results indicate that the interplay between nonlinear Alfv\'en wave dynamics, expansion effects and kinetic instabilities plays a fundamental role in solar wind dynamics, with implications for interpreting solar wind heating rate estimates.</description>

      <title>Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.</description>

      <title>The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| &lt;= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.</description>
