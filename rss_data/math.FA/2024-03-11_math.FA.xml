      <description>arXiv:2403.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we will introduce the new concept of K-bi-g-frames for Hilbert spaces. Then, we examine some characterizations with the help of a biframe operator. Finally, we investigate several results about the stability of K-bi-g-frames are produced via the use of frame theory methods.</description>

      <title>On a theorem due to Murray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of $\alpha$-quasicomplemented and totally $\alpha$-quasicomplemented subspaces and we established some results under these contexts. We show, for example, that if $X$ is a separable or reflexive Banach space and $Y$ is a closed infinite codimensional subspace of $X$, then $Y$ is totally$\mathit{\ }\alpha$-quasicomplemented if, and only if, $\alpha&lt;\aleph_{0}$ $\left( \text{this is an analogue of the theorem of Murray-Mackey and Lindenstrauss}\right) $. We also show that if $H$ is a Hilbert space and $Y,W\subset H$ are closed subspaces of $H$ such that $W$ is orthogonal to $Y$ and $\operatorname{codim}\left( Y+W\right) =\infty$, then $Y$ has a quasicomplement $Z$ containing $W$ with $\dim Z/W=\infty$. Other results in the different contexts are also included. Such results establish a connection between the theory of quasicomplemented subspaces and $\left( \alpha,\beta\right) $-spaceability.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish trace inequalities for Riesz potentials on Herz-type spaces and discuss the optimality of conditions imposed on specific parameters. We also present some applications in the form of Sobolev-type inequalities, including the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality and the fractional integration theorem in the Herz space setting. In addition, we obtain a Sobolev embedding theorem for Herz-type Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Hodge Theorem for Krein-Feller operators on compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an open set in a compact smooth oriented Riemannian n-manifold and a positive finite Borel measure with support contained in the closure of the open set, we define an associated Krein-Feller operator on k-forms by assuming the Poincare inequality. Krein-Feller operators on Euclidean space have been studied extensively in fractal geometry. Using results established by the authors, we obtain sufficient conditions for Krein-Feller operator to have compact resolvent. Under these conditions, we prove the Hodge theorem for forms, which states that there exists an orthonormal basis of L2 consisting of eigenforms of Krein-Feller operator, the eigenspaces are finite-dimensional, and the eigenvalues of Krein-Feller operator are real, countable, and increasing to infinity. One of these sufficient conditions is that the dimension of the measure is greater than n-2. Our result extends the classical Hodge theorem to Krein-Feller operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely characterize $L^p-L^q$ boundedness of two classes of Forelli-Rudin type operators on the unit ball of $\mathbb{C}^n$ for all $(p, q)\in [1, \infty]\times [1, \infty]$. The results are not only a complement to some previous results on Forelli-Rudin type operators by Kures and Zhu in 2006 and the first author in 2015, but also a high dimension extension of some results by Cheng, Fang, Wang and Yu in 2017.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear bounded operators acting in Banach spaces with a basis, such operators can be represented by an infinite matrix. We prove that for an invertible operator there exists a sequence of invertible finite-dimensional operators so that the family of norms of their inverses is uniformly bounded. It leads to the fact that solutions of finite-dimensional equations converge to the solution of initial operator equation with infinite-dimensional matrix.</description>

Abstract: For a discrete group $G$, we consider certain ideals $\mathcal{I}\subset c_0(G)$ of sequences with prescribed rate of convergence to zero. We show that the equality between the full group C$^\ast$-algebra of $G$ and the C$^\ast$-completion $\mathrm{C}_{\mathcal{I}}^\ast(G)$ in the sense of Brown and Guentner implies that $G$ is amenable.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Log-concave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rogers-Shephard and Zhang's projection inequalities are two reverse, affine isoperimetric inequalities relating the volumes of a convex body and its difference body and polar projection body, respectively. Following a classical work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called higher-order setting. In this work, we establish the higher-order analogues for these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions. In particular, this extends the Zhang's inequality for absolutely continuous log-concave functions. We introduce an iterated sup-convolution to tackle the Rogers-Shephard inequality.</description>

Abstract: For a class of evolution equations that possibly have only local solutions, we introduce a stochastic component that ensures that the solutions of the corresponding stochastically perturbed equations are global. The class of partial differential equations amenable for this type of treatment includes the 3D Navier-Stokes equation, the rotating shallow water equation (viscous and inviscid), 3D Euler equation (in vorticity form), 2D Burgers' equation and many other fluid dynamics models.</description>

      <title>On relative commutants of subalgebras in group and tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete group acting on a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Given $x\in X$, and $\mu\in\text{Prob}(X)$, we introduce the notion of contraction of $\mu$ towards $x$ with respect to unitary elements of a group von Neumann algebra not necessarily coming from group elements. Using this notion, we study relative commutants of subalgebras in tracial crossed product von Neumann algebras. The results are applied to negatively curved groups and $\text{SL}(d,\mathbb{Z})$, $d \geq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of asymptotically almost periodic solutions of the parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system on a real hyperbolic manifold. We prove the existence and uniqueness of such solutions in the linear equation case by using the dispersive and smoothing estimates of the heat semigroup. Then we pass to the well-posedness of semi-linear equation case by using the results of linear equation and fixed point arguments. The exponential decay is proven by using Gronwall's inequality.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric Inequalities on Slabs with applications to Cubes and Gaussian Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study isoperimetric inequalities on "slabs", namely weighted Riemannian manifolds obtained as the product of the uniform measure on a finite length interval with a codimension-one base. As our two main applications, we consider the case when the base is the flat torus $\mathbb{R}^2 / 2 \mathbb{Z}^2$ and the standard Gaussian measure in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$.
  The isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube predicts that minimizers are enclosed by spheres about a corner, cylinders about an edge and coordinate planes. Our analysis confirms the isoperimetric conjecture on the three-dimensional cube with side lengths $(\beta,1,1)$ in a new range of relatives volumes $\bar v \in [0,1/2]$. In particular, we confirm the conjecture for the standard cube ($\beta=1$) for all $\bar v \leq 0.120582$, when $\beta \leq 0.919431$ for the entire range where spheres are conjectured to be minimizing, and also for all $\bar v \in [0,1/2] \setminus (\frac{1}{\pi} - \frac{\beta}{4},\frac{1}{\pi} + \frac{\beta}{4})$. When $\beta \leq 0.919431$ we reduce the validity of the full conjecture to establishing that the half-plane $\{ x \in [0,\beta] \times [0,1]^2 \; ; \; x_3 \leq \frac{1}{\pi} \}$ is an isoperimetric minimizer. We also show that the analogous conjecture on a high-dimensional cube $[0,1]^n$ is false for $n \geq 10$.
  In the case of a slab with a Gaussian base of width $T&gt;0$, we identify a phase transition when $T = \sqrt{2 \pi}$ and when $T = \pi$. In particular, while products of half-planes with $[0,T]$ are always minimizing when $T \leq \sqrt{2 \pi}$, when $T &gt; \pi$ they are never minimizing, being beaten by Gaussian unduloids. In the range $T \in (\sqrt{2 \pi},\pi]$, a potential trichotomy occurs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a functional version of the additive kinematic formula as an application of the Hadwiger theorem on convex functions together with a Kubota-type formula for mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. As an application, we give a new explanation for the equivalence of the representations of functional intrinsic volumes as singular Hessian valuations and as integrals with respect to mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. In addition, we obtain a new integral geometric formula for mixed area measures of convex bodies, where integration on $\operatorname{SO}(n-1)\times \operatorname{O}(1)$ is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.10923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a weighted version of one-dimensional discrete Hardy inequalities with power weights of the form $n^\alpha$. We prove the inequality when $\alpha$ is an even natural number with the sharp constant and remainder terms. We also find explicit constants in standard and weighted Rellich inequalities and its higher order versions. As a by-product of this work we derive a combinatorial identity using purely analytic methods. This suggests a correlation between combinatorial identities and functional identities.</description>

Abstract: We consider distinguished varieties in the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ and the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb{G}_2$. A commuting pair of Hilbert space operators $(S,P)$ for which $\Gamma=\overline{\mathbb{G}}_2$ is a spectral set is called a \textit{$\Gamma$-contraction}. A commuting pair of contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ is said to be \textit{toral} if there is a toral polynomial $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $p(T_1,T_2)=0$. Similarly, a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called $\Gamma$-\textit{distinguished} if $(S,P)$ is annihilated by a $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial in $\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$. The main results af this article are the following: we find a necessary and sufficient condition such that a toral pair of contractions dilates to a toral pair of isometries. Also, we characterize all $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions that admit $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometric dilations. We determine the distinguished boundary of a distinguished variety in $\mathbb D^2$ and $\mathbb G_2$. Then we prove that a pair of commuting contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ (or a $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$) dilates to a toral pair of isometries (or a $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometry) if and only if there is a toral polynomial (or $\Gamma$-distinguished polynomial) $p\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb D}^2$ (or $Z(p) \cap \overline{\mathbb G}_2$) is a complete spectral set for $(T_1,T_2)$ (or $(S,P)$). We provide several examples at places to show the contrasts between the theory of toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions.</description>

      <title>Envelopes in the class of Banach algebras of polynomial growth and $C^\infty$-functions of a finite number of free variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of envelope of a topological algebra (in particular, an arbitrary associative algebra) with respect to a class of Banach algebra. In the case of the class of real Banach algebras of polynomial growth, i.e., admitting a $C^\infty$-functional calculus for every element, we get a functor that maps the algebra of polynomials in $k$ variables to the algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on $\mathbb{R}^k$. The envelope of a general commutative or non-commutative algebra can be treated as an algebra of $C^\infty$-functions on some commutative or non-commutative space. In particular, we describe the envelopes of the universal enveloping algebra of finite-dimensional Lie algebras, the coordinate algebras of the quantum plane and quantum $SL(2)$ and also look at some commutative examples. A result on algebras of `free $C^\infty$-functions', i.e., the envelopes of free associative algebras of finite rank $k$, is announced for general $k$ and proved for $k\le 2$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates of $L^p$ maximal regularity for nonautonomous operators and global existence for quasilinear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain quantitative estimates of the continuity constant for the $L^p$ maximal regularity of relatively continuous nonautonomous operators $\mathbb{A} : I \longrightarrow \mathcal{L}(D,X)$, where $D \subset X$ densely and compactly. They allow in particular to establish a new general growth condition for the global existence of strong solutions of Cauchy problems for nonlocal quasilinear equations for a certain class of nonlinearities $u \longrightarrow \mathbb{A}(u)$. The estimates obtained rely on the precise asymptotic analysis of the continuity constant with respect to perturbations of the operator of the form $\mathbb{A}(\cdot) + \lambda I$ as $\lambda \longrightarrow \pm \infty$. A complementary work in preparation supplements this abstract inquiry with an application of these results to nonlocal parabolic equations in noncylindrical domains depending on the time variable.</description>

      <title>On the resolvent of $H+A^{*}+A$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a much shorter and streamlined proof of an improved version of the results previously given in [A. Posilicano: On the Self-Adjointness of $H+A^{*}+A$, Math. Phys. Anal. Geom. (2020)] concerning the self-adjoint realizations of formal QFT-like Hamiltonians of the kind $H+A^{*}+A$, where $H$ and $A$ play the role of the free field Hamiltonian and of the annihilation operator respectively. We give explicit representations of the resolvent and of the self-adjointness domain; the consequent Krein-type resolvent formula leads to a characterization of these self-adjoint realizations as limit (with respect to convergence in norm resolvent sense) of cutoff Hamiltonians of the kind $H+A^{*}_{n}+A_{n}-E_{n}$, the bounded operator $E_{n}$ playing the role of a renormalizing counter term.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Moreau Envelopes of f-Divergences in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most commonly used $f$-divergences of measures, e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence, are subject to limitations regarding the support of the involved measures. A remedy consists of regularizing the $f$-divergence by a squared maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) associated with a characteristic kernel $K$. In this paper, we use the so-called kernel mean embedding to show that the corresponding regularization can be rewritten as the Moreau envelope of some function in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with $K$. Then, we exploit well-known results on Moreau envelopes in Hilbert spaces to prove properties of the MMD-regularized $f$-divergences and, in particular, their gradients. Subsequently, we use our findings to analyze Wasserstein gradient flows of MMD-regularized $f$-divergences. Finally, we consider Wasserstein gradient flows starting from empirical measures. We provide proof-of-the-concept numerical examples for $f$-divergences with both infinite and finite recession constant.</description>

      <title>Integration type operators and point evaluation on weighted Bergman spaces of Dirichlet series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Banach spaces of Dirichlet series has drawn an increasing attention in the recent 25 years. One of the main interest of this new theory is that of defining analogues of the classical spaces of analytic functions on the unit disc. In this sense, Bergman spaces were introduced several years ago contributing to broaden the picture of this theory. In the paper presenting these new family of spaces, some of its most essential questions were considered. Among them, some partial estimates of the norm of the pointwise evaluation functional were given. In this work, we introduce a version of the Riemann-Liouville semigroup acting on these spaces, and, with this new tool, we are able to estimate the norm of this functional.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis Spaces for Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hypothesis space for deep learning that employs deep neural networks (DNNs). By treating a DNN as a function of two variables, the physical variable and parameter variable, we consider the primitive set of the DNNs for the parameter variable located in a set of the weight matrices and biases determined by a prescribed depth and widths of the DNNs. We then complete the linear span of the primitive DNN set in a weak* topology to construct a Banach space of functions of the physical variable. We prove that the Banach space so constructed is a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS) and construct its reproducing kernel. We investigate two learning models, regularized learning and minimum interpolation problem in the resulting RKBS, by establishing representer theorems for solutions of the learning models. The representer theorems unfold that solutions of these learning models can be expressed as linear combination of a finite number of kernel sessions determined by given data and the reproducing kernel.</description>
