      <title>From Service-Oriented Computing to Metaverse Services: A Framework for Inclusive and Immersive Learning for Neurodivergent Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metaverse offers immersive and adaptive learning environments for neurodivergent students to thrive and reach their full potential. In this paper, we propose a generic framework that leverages metaverse services as an evolution beyond traditional service-oriented computing, enabling more interactive, personalized, and engaging educational experiences. By integrating AI-driven adaptability, multimodal interaction, and privacy-first service design, the framework ensures that learning remains accessible, inclusive, and secure. Additionally, we explore the challenges associated with scalability, data privacy, and ethical considerations while highlighting opportunities for fostering safe and student-centered virtual spaces. Our analysis underscores the potential of metaverse-based learning to bridge accessibility gaps, support social-emotional development, and empower neurodivergent learners in both digital and real-world settings. We also provide recommendations and policy considerations for creating a secure, inclusive, and scalable metaverse learn-ing ecosystem for neurodivergent students.</description>

      <title>How built environment shapes cycling experience: A multi-scale review in historical urban contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how built environments shape human experience is central to designing sustainable cities. Cycling provides a critical case: it delivers health and environmental benefits, yet its uptake depends strongly on the experience of cycling rather than infrastructure alone. Research on this relationship has grown rapidly but remains fragmented across disciplines and scales, and has concentrated on network-level analyses of routes and connectivity. This bias is especially problematic in historical cities, where embedding new infrastructure is difficult, and where cycling experience is shaped not only by spatial form but also by how cyclists perceive, interpret, and physically respond to their environment - through psychological factors such as safety and comfort, physiological demands such as stress and fatigue, and perceptual cues in the streetscape. We systematically reviewed 68 studies across urban planning, transportation, behavioural science, neuroscience, and public health. Two scales of analysis were identified: a macro scale addressing the ability to cycle and a micro scale addressing the propensity to cycle. Methods were classified into objective and subjective approaches, with hybrid approaches beginning to emerge. We find a persistent reliance on objective proxies, limited integration of subjective accounts, and insufficient attention to the streetscape as a lived environment. Addressing these gaps is essential to explain why environments enable or deter cycling, and to inform the design of cities that support cycling as both mobility and lived experience.</description>

      <title>Assessing metadata privacy in neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ethical and legal imperative to share research data without causing harm requires careful attention to privacy risks. While mounting evidence demonstrates that data sharing benefits science, legitimate concerns persist regarding the potential leakage of personal information that could lead to reidentification and subsequent harm. We reviewed metadata accompanying neuroimaging datasets from six heterogeneous studies openly available on OpenNeuro, involving participants across the lifespan, from children to older adults, with and without clinical diagnoses, and including associated clinical score data. Using metaprivBIDS (https://github.com/CPernet/metaprivBIDS), a novel tool for the systematic assessment of privacy in tabular data, we found that privacy is generally well maintained, with serious vulnerabilities being rare. Nonetheless, minor issues were identified in nearly all datasets and warrant mitigation. Notably, clinical score data (e.g., neuropsychological results) posed minimal reidentification risk, whereas demographic variables (age, sex, race, income, and geolocation) represented the principal privacy vulnerabilities. We outline practical measures to address these risks, enabling safer data sharing practices.</description>

      <title>Beyond Community Notes: A Framework for Understanding and Building Crowdsourced Context Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly developing features that display crowdsourced context alongside posts, modeled after X's Community Notes. These systems, which we term Crowdsourced Context Systems (CCS), have the potential to reshape our information ecosystem as major platforms embrace them as alternatives to top-down fact-checking. To deeply understand the features and implications of such systems, we perform a systematic literature review of existing CCS research and analyze several real-world CSS implementations. Based on our analysis, we develop a framework with three distinct components. First, we present a theoretical model to help conceptualize and define CCS. Second, we identify a design space encompassing six key aspects of CCS: participation, inputs, curation, presentation, platform treatment, and transparency. Third, we identify key normative implications of different CCS design and implementation choices. Our framework integrates these theoretical, design, and ethical perspectives to establish a foundation for future human-centered research on Crowdsourced Context Systems.</description>

      <title>Digital Engineering Transformation as a Sociotechnical Challenge: Categorization of Barriers and Their Mapping to DoD's Policy Goals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Engineering (DE) transformation represents a paradigm shift in systems engineering (SE), aiming to integrate diverse analytical models and digital artifacts into an authoritative source of truth for improved traceability and more efficient system lifecycle management. Despite institutional support, many DE initiatives underperform or fail to realize their intended benefits. We argue that this often results from a limited understanding of the social and technical barriers, and particularly how their interplay shapes transformation outcomes. To address this gap, we document barriers identified in the literature and grounded in sociotechnical systems theory, organized into six dimensions: people, processes, culture, goals, infrastructure, and technology. We then map these barriers to the U.S. Department of Defense's DE policy goals. Our analysis shows that technological investments alone are insufficient, as failures frequently arise from social factors such as workforce readiness, leadership support, and cultural alignment. The mapping also demonstrates that sociotechnical barriers often cascade across dimensions, making their impact on policy goals difficult to trace and complicating implementation. These insights carry practical implications: managers may use the mapping as a diagnostic tool to identify risks and prioritize resources; policymakers may complement strategic mandates with sustained investments and long-term change management; and engineers may view DE not as a threat to job security but as an opportunity for more effective collaboration.</description>

      <title>The (Short-Term) Effects of Large Language Models on Unemployment and Earnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models have spread rapidly since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, accompanied by claims of major productivity gains but also concerns about job displacement. This paper examines the short-run labor market effects of LLM adoption by comparing earnings and unemployment across occupations with differing levels of exposure to these technologies. Using a Synthetic Difference in Differences approach, we estimate the impact of LLM exposure on earnings and unemployment. Our findings show that workers in highly exposed occupations experienced earnings increases following ChatGPT's introduction, while unemployment rates remained unchanged. These results suggest that initial labor market adjustments to LLMs operate primarily through earnings rather than worker reallocation.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Familiarity with Television to Enrich Older Adults' Engagement and Wellbeing: A Feasibility Study Using Video Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shift away from multigenerational families to nuclear families in India has created a growing need to support older adults living independently. While technology can help address this gap, older adults' limited exposure to newer technology restricts the adoption of such solutions. However, they remain comfortable with long-standing technologies like television (TV). This study explores their daily technology usage and challenges, aiming to determine whether TV can be leveraged to improve their quality of life. We examined how TV systems could be enhanced to assist older adults with tasks such as staying connected, receiving health alerts, and ensuring security. Using a participatory design approach, we developed video probes using the prototype of the TV-based application and interviewed 27 older adults to assess its acceptance and usability. Our findings demonstrate older adults' strong interest in a TV-based solution and a preference for familiar technology to support security, independence, and wellbeing.</description>

      <title>Relational Dissonance in Human-AI Interactions: The Case of Knowledge Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When AI systems allow human-like communication, they elicit increasingly complex relational responses. Knowledge workers face a particular challenge: They approach these systems as tools while interacting with them in ways that resemble human social interaction. To understand the relational contexts that arise when humans engage with anthropomorphic conversational agents, we need to expand existing human-computer interaction frameworks. Through three workshops with qualitative researchers, we found that the fundamental ontological and relational ambiguities inherent in anthropomorphic conversational agents make it difficult for individuals to maintain consistent relational stances toward them. Our findings indicate that people's articulated positioning toward such agents often differs from the relational dynamics that occur during interactions. We propose the concept of relational dissonance to help researchers, designers, and policymakers recognize the resulting tensions in the development, deployment, and governance of anthropomorphic conversational agents and address the need for relational transparency.</description>

      <title>The Impact of AI Adoption on Retail Across Countries and Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) adoption on job loss rates using the Global AI Content Impact Dataset (2020--2025). The panel comprises 200 industry-country-year observations across Australia, China, France, Japan, and the United Kingdom in ten industries. A three-stage ordinary least squares (OLS) framework is applied. First, a full-sample regression finds no significant linear association between AI adoption rate and job loss rate ($\beta \approx -0.0026$, $p = 0.949$). Second, industry-specific regressions identify the marketing and retail sectors as closest to significance. Third, interaction-term models quantify marginal effects in those two sectors, revealing a significant retail interaction effect ($-0.138$, $p &lt; 0.05$), showing that higher AI adoption is linked to lower job loss in retail. These findings extend empirical evidence on AI's labor market impact, emphasize AI's productivity-enhancing role in retail, and support targeted policy measures such as intelligent replenishment systems and cashierless checkout implementations.</description>

      <title>The Psychology of Falsehood: A Human-Centric Survey of Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation remains one of the most significant issues in the digital age. While automated fact-checking has emerged as a viable solution, most current systems are limited to evaluating factual accuracy. However, the detrimental effect of misinformation transcends simple falsehoods; it takes advantage of how individuals perceive, interpret, and emotionally react to information. This underscores the need to move beyond factuality and adopt more human-centered detection frameworks. In this survey, we explore the evolving interplay between traditional fact-checking approaches and psychological concepts such as cognitive biases, social dynamics, and emotional responses. By analyzing state-of-the-art misinformation detection systems through the lens of human psychology and behavior, we reveal critical limitations of current methods and identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, we outline future research directions aimed at creating more robust and adaptive frameworks, such as neuro-behavioural models that integrate technological factors with the complexities of human cognition and social influence. These approaches offer promising pathways to more effectively detect and mitigate the societal harms of misinformation.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS): Adaptive Interfaces and Trustworthy Human-AI Collaboration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in maritime domains is accelerating alongside advances in artificial intelligence, sensing, and connectivity. Opaque decision-making and poorly calibrated human-automation interaction remain key barriers to safe adoption. This article synthesizes 100 studies on automation transparency for Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) spanning situation awareness (SA), human factors, interface design, and regulation. We (i) map the Guidance-Navigation-Control stack to shore-based operational modes -- remote supervision (RSM) and remote control (RCM) -- and identify where human unsafe control actions (Human-UCAs) concentrate in handover and emergency loops; (ii) summarize evidence that transparency features (decision rationales, alternatives, confidence/uncertainty, and rule-compliance indicators) improve understanding and support trust calibration, though reliability and predictability often dominate trust; (iii) distill design strategies for transparency at three layers: sensor/SA acquisition and fusion, HMI/eHMI presentation (textual/graphical overlays, color coding, conversational and immersive UIs), and engineer-facing processes (resilient interaction design, validation, and standardization). We integrate methods for Human-UCA identification (STPA-Cog + IDAC), quantitative trust/SA assessment, and operator workload monitoring, and outline regulatory and rule-based implications including COLREGs formalization and route exchange. We conclude with an adaptive transparency framework that couples operator state estimation with explainable decision support to reduce cognitive overload and improve takeover timeliness. The review highlights actionable figure-of-merit displays (e.g., CPA/TCPA risk bars, robustness heatmaps), transparent model outputs (rule traceability, confidence), and training pipelines (HIL/MIL, simulation) as near-term levers for safer MASS operations.</description>

      <title>Predicting the descent into extremism and terrorism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists, extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could be attributed to major events.</description>

      <title>A High-performance Real-time Container File Monitoring Approach Based on Virtual Machine Introspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As cloud computing continues to advance and become an integral part of modern IT infrastructure, container security has emerged as a critical factor in ensuring the smooth operation of cloud-native applications. An attacker can attack the service in the container or even perform the container escape attack by tampering with the files. Monitoring container files is important for APT detection and cyberspace security. Existing file monitoring methods are usually based on host operating system or virtual machine introspection to protect file security in real time. The methods based on the host operating system usually monitor file operations in the host operating system. However, when the container escapes to the host, the host operating system will no longer be secure, so these methods face the problem of weak security. Aiming at the problems of low security and high overload introduced in existing container file monitoring, a high-performance container file monitoring method based on virtual machine introspection is proposed. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively monitor the container files and introduce an acceptable monitoring overload.</description>

      <title>Silenced voices: social media polarization and women's marginalization in peacebuilding during the Northern Ethiopia War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the complex relationship between social media, polarization, and conflict, with a focus on digital peacebuilding and women's participation, using the Northern Ethiopia War as a case study. Using a qualitative exploratory design through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and document analysis, the research examines how social media platforms influence conflict dynamics. The study applies and advances social identity, liberal feminist, and intersectionality theories to analyze social media's role in shaping conflict, mobilizing ethnic politics, and influencing women's involvement in peacebuilding. Findings reveal that the weaponization of social media intensifies polarization and offline violence. Women are disproportionately impacted through displacement, exclusion from peace negotiations, and heightened risks of gender-based violence, including rape. Contributing factors include hostile online environments, the digital divide, and prevailing socio-cultural norms. The study identifies significant gaps in leveraging digital platforms for sustainable peace, including government-imposed internet shutdowns, unregulated social media environments, and low media literacy. It recommends media literacy initiatives, inclusive peacebuilding frameworks, open and safe digital spaces, and gender-sensitive technological approaches. By centering digital technology, conflict, and gender in the Global South, this research contributes valuable insights to ongoing debates on ICT in conflict, peacebuilding, and women's empowerment.</description>

      <title>Who is Responsible When AI Fails? Mapping Causes, Entities, and Consequences of AI Privacy and Ethical Incidents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has raised major privacy and ethical concerns. However, existing AI incident taxonomies and guidelines lack grounding in real-world cases, limiting their effectiveness for prevention and mitigation. We analyzed 202 real-world AI privacy and ethical incidents to develop a taxonomy that classifies them across AI lifecycle stages and captures contributing factors, including causes, responsible entities, sources of disclosure, and impacts. Our findings reveal widespread harms from poor organizational decisions and legal non-compliance, limited corrective interventions, and rare reporting from AI developers and adopting entities. Our taxonomy offers a structured approach for systematic incident reporting and emphasizes the weaknesses of current AI governance frameworks. Our findings provide actionable guidance for policymakers and practitioners to strengthen user protections, develop targeted AI policies, enhance reporting practices, and foster responsible AI governance and innovation, especially in contexts such as social media and child protection.</description>

      <title>The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side, there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Textbooks are a cornerstone of education, but they have a fundamental limitation: they are a one-size-fits-all medium. Any new material or alternative representation requires arduous human effort, so that textbooks cannot be adapted in a scalable manner. We present an approach for transforming and augmenting textbooks using generative AI, adding layers of multiple representations and personalization while maintaining content integrity and quality. We refer to the system built with this approach as Learn Your Way. We report pedagogical evaluations of the different transformations and augmentations, and present the results of a a randomized control trial, highlighting the advantages of learning with Learn Your Way over regular textbook usage.</description>

      <title>How Do Social Bots Participate in Misinformation Spread? A Comprehensive Dataset and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms provide an ideal environment to spread misinformation, where social bots can accelerate the spread. This paper explores the interplay between social bots and misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform. We construct a large-scale dataset that includes annotations for both misinformation and social bots. From the misinformation perspective, the dataset is multimodal, containing 11,393 pieces of misinformation and 16,416 pieces of verified information. From the social bot perspective, this dataset contains 65,749 social bots and 345,886 genuine accounts, annotated using a weakly supervised annotator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the dataset, the clear distinction between misinformation and real information, and the high quality of social bot annotations. Further analysis illustrates that: (i) social bots are deeply involved in information spread; (ii) misinformation with the same topics has similar content, providing the basis of echo chambers, and social bots would amplify this phenomenon; and (iii) social bots generate similar content aiming to manipulate public opinions.</description>

      <title>Negotiative Alignment: Embracing Disagreement to Achieve Fairer Outcomes -- Insights from Urban Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban assessments often compress diverse needs into single scores, which can obscure minority perspectives. We present a community-centered study in Montreal (n=35; wheelchair users, seniors, LGBTQIA2+ residents, and immigrants). Participants rated 20 streets (accessibility, inclusivity, aesthetics, practicality) and ranked 7 images on 12 interview-elicited criteria. Disagreement patterns were systematic in our sample: wheelchair users diverged most on accessibility and practicality; LGBTQIA2+ participants emphasized inclusion and liveliness; seniors prioritized security. Group discussion reduced information gaps but not value conflicts; ratings conveyed intensity, while rankings forced trade-offs. We then formalize negotiative alignment, a transparent, budget-aware bargaining procedure, and pilot it with role-played stakeholder agents plus a neutral mediator. Relative to the best base design under the same public rubric, the negotiated package increased total utility (21.10 to 24.55), raised the worst-group utility (3.20 to 3.90), improved twentieth percentile satisfaction (0.86 to 1.00; min-max normalized within the scenario), and reduced inequality (Gini 0.036 to 0.025). Treating disagreement as signal and reporting worst-group outcomes alongside totals may help planners and AI practitioners surface trade-offs and preserve minority priorities while maintaining efficiency.</description>

      <title>CLEAR: A Clinically-Grounded Tabular Framework for Radiology Report Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing metrics often lack the granularity and interpretability to capture nuanced clinical differences between candidate and ground-truth radiology reports, resulting in suboptimal evaluation. We introduce a Clinically-grounded tabular framework with Expert-curated labels and Attribute-level comparison for Radiology report evaluation (CLEAR). CLEAR not only examines whether a report can accurately identify the presence or absence of medical conditions, but also assesses whether it can precisely describe each positively identified condition across five key attributes: first occurrence, change, severity, descriptive location, and recommendation. Compared to prior works, CLEAR's multi-dimensional, attribute-level outputs enable a more comprehensive and clinically interpretable evaluation of report quality. Additionally, to measure the clinical alignment of CLEAR, we collaborate with five board-certified radiologists to develop CLEAR-Bench, a dataset of 100 chest X-ray reports from MIMIC-CXR, annotated across 6 curated attributes and 13 CheXpert conditions. Our experiments show that CLEAR achieves high accuracy in extracting clinical attributes and provides automated metrics that are strongly aligned with clinical judgment.</description>

      <title>Fairness-in-the-Workflow: How Machine Learning Practitioners at Big Tech Companies Approach Fairness in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS), which are widely deployed across high-stakes domains, are susceptible to biases that can cause large-scale societal impacts. Researchers have proposed methods to measure and mitigate such biases -- but translating academic theory into practice is inherently challenging. RS practitioners must balance the competing interests of diverse stakeholders, including providers and users, and operate in dynamic environments. Through a semi-structured interview study (N=11), we map the RS practitioner workflow within large technology companies, focusing on how technical teams consider fairness internally and in collaboration with other (legal, data, and fairness) teams. We identify key challenges to incorporating fairness into existing RS workflows: defining fairness in RS contexts, particularly when navigating multi-stakeholder and dynamic fairness considerations. We also identify key organization-wide challenges: making time for fairness work and facilitating cross-team communication. Finally, we offer actionable recommendations for the RS community, including HCI researchers and practitioners.</description>

      <title>AmpleHate: Amplifying the Attention for Versatile Implicit Hate Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit hate speech detection is challenging due to its subtlety and reliance on contextual interpretation rather than explicit offensive words. Current approaches rely on contrastive learning, which are shown to be effective on distinguishing hate and non-hate sentences. Humans, however, detect implicit hate speech by first identifying specific targets within the text and subsequently interpreting how these target relate to their surrounding context. Motivated by this reasoning process, we propose AmpleHate, a novel approach designed to mirror human inference for implicit hate detection. AmpleHate identifies explicit target using a pretrained Named Entity Recognition model and capture implicit target information via [CLS] tokens. It computes attention-based relationships between explicit, implicit targets and sentence context and then, directly injects these relational vectors into the final sentence representation. This amplifies the critical signals of target-context relations for determining implicit hate. Experiments demonstrate that AmpleHate achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming contrastive learning baselines by an average of 82.14% and achieve faster convergence. Qualitative analyses further reveal that attention patterns produced by AmpleHate closely align with human judgement, underscoring its interpretability and robustness.

      <title>From Judgment to Interference: Early Stopping LLM Harmful Outputs via Streaming Content Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though safety alignment has been applied to most large language models (LLMs), LLM service providers generally deploy a subsequent moderation as the external safety guardrail in real-world products. Existing moderators mainly practice a conventional full detection, which determines the harmfulness based on the complete LLM output, causing high service latency. Recent works pay more attention to partial detection where moderators oversee the generation midway and early stop the output if harmfulness is detected, but they directly apply moderators trained with the full detection paradigm to incomplete outputs, introducing a training-inference gap that lowers the performance. In this paper, we explore how to form a data-and-model solution that natively supports partial detection. For the data, we construct FineHarm, a dataset consisting of 29K prompt-response pairs with fine-grained annotations to provide reasonable supervision for token-level training. Then, we propose the streaming content monitor, which is trained with dual supervision of response- and token-level labels and can follow the output stream of LLM to make a timely judgment of harmfulness. Experiments show that SCM gains 0.95+ in macro F1 score that is comparable to full detection, by only seeing the first 18% of tokens in responses on average. Moreover, the SCM can serve as a pseudo-harmfulness annotator for improving safety alignment and lead to a higher harmlessness score than DPO.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Fairness: Not a Purely Technical but Socio-Technical Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid trend of deploying artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) systems in socially consequential domains has raised growing concerns about their trustworthiness, including potential discriminatory behaviours. Research in algorithmic fairness has generated a proliferation of mathematical definitions and metrics, yet persistent misconceptions and limitations -- both within and beyond the fairness community -- limit their effectiveness, such as an unreached consensus on its understanding, prevailing measures primarily tailored to binary group settings, and superficial handling for intersectional contexts. Here we critically remark on these misconceptions and argue that fairness cannot be reduced to purely technical constraints on models; we also examine the limitations of existing fairness measures through conceptual analysis and empirical illustrations, showing their limited applicability in the face of complex real-world scenarios, challenging prevailing views on the incompatibility between accuracy and fairness as well as that among fairness measures themselves, and outlining three worth-considering principles in the design of fairness measures. We believe these findings will help bridge the gap between technical formalisation and social realities and meet the challenges of real-world AI/ML deployment.</description>

      <title>AI for Scientific Discovery is a Social Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant, we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for technical progress.</description>

      <title>"My Boyfriend is AI": A Computational Analysis of Human-AI Companionship in Reddit's AI Community</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of AI companion applications has created novel forms of intimate human-AI relationships, yet empirical research on these communities remains limited. We present the first large-scale computational analysis of r/MyBoyfriendIsAI, Reddit's primary AI companion community (27,000+ members). Using exploratory qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis employing classifiers, we identify six primary conversation themes, with visual sharing of couple pictures and ChatGPT-specific discussions dominating the discourse of the most viewed posts. Through analyzing the top posts in the community, our findings reveal how community members' AI companionship emerges unintentionally through functional use rather than deliberate seeking, with users reporting therapeutic benefits led by reduced loneliness, always-available support, and mental health improvements. Our work covers primary concerns about human intimacy with AIs such as emotional dependency, reality dissociation, and grief from model updates. We observe users materializing relationships following traditional human-human relationship customs, such as wedding rings. Community dynamics indicate active resistance to stigmatization through advocacy and mutual validation. This work contributes an empirical understanding of AI companionship as an emerging sociotechnical phenomenon.</description>
