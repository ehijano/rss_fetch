      <title>DINO-AD: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection with Frozen DINO-V3 Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in medical images aims to identify abnormal regions without relying on pixel-level annotations, which is crucial for scalable and label-efficient diagnostic systems. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework based on DINO-V3 representations, termed DINO-AD, which leverages self-supervised visual features for precise and interpretable anomaly localization. Specifically, we introduce an embedding similarity matching strategy to select a semantically aligned support image and a foreground-aware K-means clustering module to model the distribution of normal features. Anomaly maps are then computed by comparing the query features with clustered normal embeddings through cosine similarity. Experimental results on both the Brain and Liver datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior quantitative performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, achieving AUROC scores of up to 98.71. Qualitative results further confirm that our framework produces clearer and more accurate anomaly localization. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of our approach.</description>

      <title>To What Extent Do Token-Level Representations from Pathology Foundation Models Improve Dense Prediction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have rapidly advanced and are becoming a common backbone for downstream clinical tasks, offering strong transferability across tissues and institutions. However, for dense prediction (e.g., segmentation), practical deployment still lacks a clear, reproducible understanding of how different PFMs behave across datasets and how adaptation choices affect performance and stability. We present PFM-DenseBench, a large-scale benchmark for dense pathology prediction, evaluating 17 PFMs across 18 public segmentation datasets. Under a unified protocol, we systematically assess PFMs with multiple adaptation and fine-tuning strategies, and derive insightful, practice-oriented findings on when and why different PFMs and tuning choices succeed or fail across heterogeneous datasets. We release containers, configs, and dataset cards to enable reproducible evaluation and informed PFM selection for real-world dense pathology tasks.

      <title>CONRep: Uncertainty-Aware Vision-Language Report Drafting Using Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated radiology report drafting (ARRD) using vision-language models (VLMs) has advanced rapidly, yet most systems lack explicit uncertainty estimates, limiting trust and safe clinical deployment. We propose CONRep, a model-agnostic framework that integrates conformal prediction (CP) to provide statistically grounded uncertainty quantification for VLM-generated radiology reports. CONRep operates at both the label level, by calibrating binary predictions for predefined findings, and the sentence level, by assessing uncertainty in free-text impressions via image-text semantic alignment. We evaluate CONRep using both generative and contrastive VLMs on public chest X-ray datasets. Across both settings, outputs classified as high confidence consistently show significantly higher agreement with radiologist annotations and ground-truth impressions than low-confidence outputs. By enabling calibrated confidence stratification without modifying underlying models, CONRep improves the transparency, reliability, and clinical usability of automated radiology reporting systems.</description>

      <title>AtlasPatch: An Efficient and Scalable Tool for Whole Slide Image Preprocessing in Computational Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, typically comprising tissue detection followed by patch extraction, is foundational to AI-driven computational pathology workflows. This remains a major computational bottleneck as existing tools either rely on inaccurate heuristic thresholding for tissue detection, or adopt AI-based approaches trained on limited-diversity data that operate at the patch level, incurring substantial computational complexity. We present AtlasPatch, an efficient and scalable slide preprocessing framework for accurate tissue detection and high-throughput patch extraction with minimal computational overhead. AtlasPatch's tissue detection module is trained on a heterogeneous and semi-manually annotated dataset of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails, using efficient fine-tuning of the Segment-Anything model. The tool extrapolates tissue masks from thumbnails to full-resolution slides to extract patch coordinates at user-specified magnifications, with options to stream patches directly into common image encoders for embedding or store patch images, all efficiently parallelized across CPUs and GPUs. We assess AtlasPatch across segmentation precision, computational complexity, and downstream multiple-instance learning, matching state-of-the-art performance while operating at a fraction of their computational cost. AtlasPatch is open-source and available at https://github.com/AtlasAnalyticsLab/AtlasPatch.</description>

      <title>MS-SCANet: A Multiscale Transformer-Based Architecture with Dual Attention for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Multi-Scale Spatial Channel Attention Network (MS-SCANet), a transformer-based architecture designed for no-reference image quality assessment (IQA). MS-SCANet features a dual-branch structure that processes images at multiple scales, effectively capturing both fine and coarse details, an improvement over traditional single-scale methods. By integrating tailored spatial and channel attention mechanisms, our model emphasizes essential features while minimizing computational complexity. A key component of MS-SCANet is its cross-branch attention mechanism, which enhances the integration of features across different scales, addressing limitations in previous approaches. We also introduce two new consistency loss functions, Cross-Branch Consistency Loss and Adaptive Pooling Consistency Loss, which maintain spatial integrity during feature scaling, outperforming conventional linear and bilinear techniques. Extensive evaluations on datasets like KonIQ-10k, LIVE, LIVE Challenge, and CSIQ show that MS-SCANet consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, offering a robust framework with stronger correlations with subjective human scores.</description>

      <title>Improving 2D Diffusion Models for 3D Medical Imaging with Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D medical imaging is in high demand and essential for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. Currently, diffusion models (DMs) have become an effective tool for medical imaging reconstruction thanks to their ability to learn rich, high-quality data priors. However, learning the 3D data distribution with DMs in medical imaging is challenging, not only due to the difficulties in data collection but also because of the significant computational burden during model training. A common compromise is to train the DMs on 2D data priors and reconstruct stacked 2D slices to address 3D medical inverse problems. However, the intrinsic randomness of diffusion sampling causes severe inter-slice discontinuities of reconstructed 3D volumes. Existing methods often enforce continuity regularizations along the z-axis, which introduces sensitive hyper-parameters and may lead to over-smoothing results. In this work, we revisit the origin of stochasticity in diffusion sampling and introduce Inter-Slice Consistent Stochasticity (ISCS), a simple yet effective strategy that encourages interslice consistency during diffusion sampling. Our key idea is to control the consistency of stochastic noise components during diffusion sampling, thereby aligning their sampling trajectories without adding any new loss terms or optimization steps. Importantly, the proposed ISCS is plug-and-play and can be dropped into any 2D trained diffusion based 3D reconstruction pipeline without additional computational cost. Experiments on several medical imaging problems show that our method can effectively improve the performance of medical 3D imaging problems based on 2D diffusion models. Our findings suggest that controlling inter-slice stochasticity is a principled and practically attractive route toward high-fidelity 3D medical imaging with 2D diffusion priors.

      <title>SAR-RAG: ATR Visual Question Answering by Semantic Search, Retrieval, and MLLM Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a visual-context image retrieval-augmented generation (ImageRAG) assisted AI agent for automatic target recognition (ATR) of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.</description>

      <title>ConvRML: High-Quality Lensless Imaging with Random Multi-Focal Lenslets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mask-based lensless imagers use simple optics and computational reconstruction to design compact form factor cameras with compressive imaging ability. However, these imagers generally suffer from poor reconstruction quality. Here, we describe several advances in both hardware and software that result in improved lensless imaging quality. First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers.</description>

      <title>Rethinking domain generalization in medical image segmentation: One image as one domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04741v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Domain shifts in medical image segmentation, particularly when data comes from different centers, pose significant challenges. Intra-center variability, such as differences in scanner models or imaging protocols, can cause domain shifts as large as, or even larger than, those between centers. To address this, we propose the "one image as one domain" (OIOD) hypothesis, which treats each image as a unique domain, enabling flexible and robust domain generalization. Based on this hypothesis, we develop a unified disentanglement-based domain generalization (UniDDG) framework, which simultaneously handles both multi-source and single-source domain generalization without requiring explicit domain labels. This approach simplifies training with a fixed architecture, independent of the number of source domains, reducing complexity and enhancing scalability. We decouple each input image into content representation and style code, then exchange and combine these within the batch for segmentation, reconstruction, and further disentanglement. By maintaining distinct style codes for each image, our model ensures thorough decoupling of content representations and style codes, improving domain invariance of the content representations. Additionally, we enhance generalization with expansion mask attention (EMA) for boundary preservation and style augmentation (SA) to simulate diverse image styles, improving robustness to domain shifts. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves Dice scores of 84.43% and 88.91% for multi-source to single-center and single-center generalization in optic disc and optic cup segmentation, respectively, and 86.96% and 88.56% for prostate segmentation, outperforming current state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, offering superior performance and adaptability across clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-device skin lesion analysis is constrained by the compute and energy cost of conventional CNN inference and by the need to update models as new patient data become available. Neuromorphic processors provide event-driven sparse computation and support on-chip incremental learning, yet deployment is often hindered by CNN-to-SNN conversion failures, including non-spike-compatible operators and accuracy degradation under class imbalance. We propose QANA, a quantization-aware CNN backbone embedded in an end-to-end pipeline engineered for conversion-stable neuromorphic execution. QANA replaces conversion-fragile components with spike-compatible transformations by bounding intermediate activations and aligning normalization with low-bit quantization, reducing conversion-induced distortion that disproportionately impacts rare classes. Efficiency is achieved through Ghost-based feature generation under tight FLOP budgets, while spatially-aware efficient channel attention and squeeze-and-excitation recalibrate channels without heavy global operators that are difficult to map to spiking cores. The resulting quantized projection head produces SNN-ready logits and enables incremental updates on edge hardware without full retraining or data offloading. On HAM10000, QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 91.0% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.5 percentage points in Top-1 accuracy (a 4.0% relative gain) and by 12.0 points in macro F1 (a 15.2% relative gain). On a clinical dataset, QANA achieves 90.8% Top-1 accuracy and 81.7% macro F1, improving the strongest converted SNN baseline by 3.2 points in Top-1 accuracy (a 3.7% relative gain) and by 3.6 points in macro F1 (a 4.6% relative gain). When deployed on BrainChip Akida, QANA runs in 1.5 ms per image with 1.7 mJ per image, corresponding to 94.6% lower latency and 99.0% lower energy than its GPU-based CNN implementation.</description>

      <title>Patient-Aware Multimodal RGB-HSI Fusion via Incremental Heuristic Meta-Learning for Oral Lesion Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early detection of oral cancer and potentially malignant diseases is a major challenge in low-resource settings due to the scarcity of annotated data. We provide a unified approach for four-class oral lesion classification that incorporates deep learning, spectral analysis, and demographic data. A pathologist-verified subset of oral cavity images was curated from a publicly available dataset. Oral cavity pictures were processed using a fine-tuned ConvNeXt-v2 network for deep embeddings before being translated into the hyperspectral domain using a reconstruction algorithm. Haemoglobin-sensitive, textural, and spectral descriptors were obtained from the reconstructed hyperspectral cubes and combined with demographic data. Multiple machine-learning models were evaluated using patient-specific validation. Finally, an incremental heuristic meta-learner (IHML) was developed that merged calibrated base classifiers via probabilistic feature stacking and uncertainty-aware abstraction of multimodal representations with patient-level smoothing. By decoupling evidence extraction from decision fusion, IHML stabilizes predictions in heterogeneous, small-sample medical datasets. On an unseen test set, our proposed model achieved a macro F1 of 66.23% and an overall accuracy of 64.56%. The findings demonstrate that RGB-to-hyperspectral reconstruction and ensemble meta-learning improve diagnostic robustness in real-world oral lesion screening.</description>

      <title>Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifolds: A Framework for Cross-Domain Representation Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Universal Latent Homeomorphic Manifold (ULHM), a framework that unifies semantic representations (e.g., human descriptions, diagnostic labels) and observation-driven machine representations (e.g., pixel intensities, sensor readings) into a single latent structure. Despite originating from fundamentally different pathways, both modalities capture the same underlying reality. We establish \emph{homeomorphism}, a continuous bijection preserving topological structure, as the mathematical criterion for determining when latent manifolds induced by different semantic-observation pairs can be rigorously unified. This criterion provides theoretical guarantees for three critical applications: (1) semantic-guided sparse recovery from incomplete observations, (2) cross-domain transfer learning with verified structural compatibility, and (3) zero-shot compositional learning via valid transfer from semantic to observation space. Our framework learns continuous manifold-to-manifold transformations through conditional variational inference, avoiding brittle point-to-point mappings. We develop practical verification algorithms, including trust, continuity, and Wasserstein distance metrics, that empirically validate homeomorphic structure from finite samples. Experiments demonstrate: (1) sparse image recovery from 5% of CelebA pixels and MNIST digit reconstruction at multiple sparsity levels, (2) cross-domain classifier transfer achieving 86.73% accuracy from MNIST to Fashion-MNIST without retraining, and (3) zero-shot classification on unseen classes achieving 78.76% on CIFAR-10. Critically, the homeomorphism criterion determines when different semantic-observation pairs share compatible latent structure, enabling principled unification into universal representations and providing a mathematical foundation for decomposing general foundation models into domain-specific components.</description>

      <title>Weight Space Correlation Analysis: Quantifying Feature Utilization in Deep Learning Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging are susceptible to shortcut learning, relying on confounding metadata (e.g., scanner model) that is often encoded in image embeddings. The crucial question is whether the model actively utilizes this encoded information for its final prediction. We introduce Weight Space Correlation Analysis, an interpretable methodology that quantifies feature utilization by measuring the alignment between the classification heads of a primary clinical task and auxiliary metadata tasks. We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner). Our methodology provides a tool to verify model trustworthiness, demonstrating that, in the absence of induced bias, the clinical model selectively utilizes features related to the genuine clinical signal.</description>

Abstract: Wave velocity is a key parameter for imaging complex media, but in vivo measurements are typically limited to reflection geometries, where only backscattered waves from short-scale heterogeneities are accessible. As a result, conventional reflection imaging fails to recover large-scale variations of the wave velocity landscape. Here we show that matrix imaging overcomes this limitation by exploiting the quality of wave focusing as an intrinsic guide star. We model wave propagation as a trainable multi-layer network that leverages optimization and deep learning tools to infer the wave velocity distribution. We validate this approach through ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms and human breast tissues, demonstrating its potential for tumour detection and characterization. Our method is broadly applicable to any kind of waves and media for which a reflection matrix can be measured.</description>
