      <title>Higher-codimension points as organizing centers in nonreciprocal pattern-forming systems with O(2)-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on a two-field Swift-Hohenberg model with linear nonreciprocal interactions, this study investigates how emerging higher-codimension points act as organizing centers for the nonequilibrium phase diagram that features various steady and dynamic phases. Complementing the numerical analysis of the field equations with time simulations and path continuation techniques, we derive a reduced dynamical system corresponding to a one-mode approximation for the critical-wavenumber modes. Furthermore, we derive the normal form equations that are valid in the vicinity of the Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation with O(2)-symmetry, which allows us to draw on corresponding literature results. Comparing results obtained on the different levels of description, we discuss the bifurcation structure relating trivial uniform and inhomogeneous steady states as well as traveling, standing and modulated waves. We also contextualize the relevance of recently highlighted features of the linear mode structure, i.e., of the dispersion relations, termed "critical exceptional points" for the transitions between the nonequilibrium phases.</description>

      <title>Painleve solitons of AKNS system and irrational algebraic solitons of NLS equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel symmetry decomposition approach is introduced to derive the so-called ``Painleve solitons'' of the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) system. These Painleve solitons propagate against a background governed by a Painleve transcendent, establishing a fundamental generalization of the well-known elliptic solitons concept. We demonstrate that while elliptic solitons arise from the combination of translation invariance and square eigenfunction symmetry, a different symmetry combination-scaling invariance, Galilean invariance, and square eigenfunction symmetry-generates ``Painleve IV solitons'' for the AKNS system. This discovery represents a significant theoretical advance in integrable systems theory. By selecting special solutions of the Painleve IV equation, we obtain explicit forms of several previously unknown classes of solutions for the AKNS system and the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation: irrational algebraic solitons, rational algebraic solitons, and parabolic cylindrical function solitons. These results dramatically expand the known solution landscape of one of the most important integrable models in mathematical physics, with broad implications for nonlinear wave phenomena across multiple physical disciplines including optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Quantum Droplets in Binary Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which integrate deep learning with physical prior knowledge, have proven to be a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The present work utilizes PINNs to analyze the existence and evolution of quantum droplets (QDs) in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), revealing the ability of this technique to accurately predict structural features of the QDs, their multipeak profiles, and dynamical behavior. The stable evolution of multipole QDs is thus demonstrated. Comparing different network architectures, including the training time, loss values, and $\mathbb{L_{2}}$ error, PINNs accurately predict specific dynamical characteristics of QDs. Furthermore, the PINN robustness is evaluated by the application of PINN to parameter-discovery tasks, considering both clean training data and data contaminated by $1\%$ random noise. The results highlight the efficiency of PINNs in modeling complex quantum systems and extracting reliable parameters under the noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>Towards spinning $U(1)$ gauged non-topological solitons in the model with Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.</description>
