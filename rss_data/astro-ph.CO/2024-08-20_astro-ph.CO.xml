      <title>The streaming model for the three-point correlation function and its connection to standard perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redshift-space distortions present a significant challenge in building models for the three-point correlation function (3PCF). We compare two possible lines of attack: the streaming model and standard perturbation theory (SPT). The two approaches differ in their treatment of the non-linear mapping from real to redshift space: SPT expands this mapping perturbatively, while the streaming model retains its non-linear form but relies on simplifying assumptions about the probability density function (PDF) of line-of-sight velocity differences between pairs or triplets of tracers. To assess the quality of the predictions and the validity of the assumptions of these models, we measure the monopole of the matter 3PCF and the first two moments of the pair- and triplewise velocity PDF from a suite of N-body simulations. We also evaluate the large-scale limit of the streaming model and determine under which conditions it aligns to SPT. On scales $&gt;10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, we find that the streaming model for the 3PCF monopole is dominated by the first two velocity moments, making the exact shape of the PDF irrelevant. This model can match the accuracy of a Stage-IV galaxy survey, if the velocity moments are measured directly from the simulations. However, replacing the measurements with perturbative expressions to leading order generates large errors already on scales of $60-70 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. This is the main drawback of the streaming model. Conversely, the SPT model for the 3PCF cannot account for the significant velocity dispersion that is present at all scales, and consequently provides predictions with limited accuracy. We demonstrate that this issue can be addressed by isolating the large-scale limit of the dispersion, which leads to typical Fingers-of-God damping functions. Overall, the SPT model with a damping function provides the best deal in terms of accuracy and computing time.</description>

      <title>Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis on a bubble universe nucleated in Kerr-AdS$_5$ Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) simulation with a bubble universe scenario around a rotating black hole (BH) in Kerr-AdS$_5$ spacetime to explain recently updated observations of light elements such as the primordial helium abundance. In this scenario, the geometry of the 4D- early Universe is described as a vacuum bubble that undergoes quasi-de Sitter expansion in Kerr- AdS$_5$ spacetime. We find that the BH mass and spin parameter, which show an anti-correlation against the total radiation, are important to resolve the ${}^4$He anomaly. The present results provide clues to finding a connection between the observed results of light-element nucleosynthesis and the scenario of the 4D-bubble universe in AdS$_5$ spacetimes</description>

      <title>Optimizing the $L$-$\sigma$ Relation of HII Galaxies for Improving Cosmological Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic premise of using HII starburst galaxies (HIIGs) as cosmic "standard candels" is that there is a significant correlation between the H$\beta$ luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from HIIGs measurements, which can be called as the empirical $L$ - $\sigma$ relation. However, the scaling $L$ - $\sigma$ relation well-calibrated with the lower-redshift HIIGs is unfitted for the higher-redshift HIIGs. To solve this problem, we explore new relational expression for the $L$ - $\sigma$ relation which should be suitable for both lower-redshift and higher-redshift HIIGs. After reconstructing the Hubble diagram with the Gaussian process (GP) method from the Pantheon+ supernovae Ia sample, we examine and compare six different revised formulas of $L$ - $\sigma$ relation. Furthermore, we use the Bayesian evidence to compare the revised $L$ - $\sigma$ relations with the analysis of a joint sample of 36 giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHRs) and 145 HIIGs. It turns out that the redshift-dependent bilinear correction and the quadratic $\sigma$ based correction are significantly better than the others. Moreover, a quadratic $\sigma$ based correction is the most supported one. It suggests that the appropriate corrections to the $L$ - $\sigma$ relation should be considered when the HIIGs are used as a kind of cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Average zero-expansion regions of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent tensions in the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model underline the importance of tests of its basic assumptions. One such potential test arises from the fact that the surface of zero expansion around the collapsing object with spherical symmetry is strictly related to the object's mass and the value of the cosmological constant. We propose a complementary probe relating the averaged zero-expansion volume to the mass and the background cosmological Hubble parameter. Using the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation we are able to relax the spherical symmetry assumption and hence obtain a more general test of cosmological dynamics. Alternatively, our method can serve as a test of compatibility of relativistic N-body simulations and the scalar, averaged Einstein's equations with the relativistic Zel'dovich approximation serving as a closure condition.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$CDM model against cosmography: A possible deviation after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an analysis of the standard flat-$\Lambda$CDM model using a cosmographic approach, incorporating recent DESI BAO observations and Supernovae Type Ia catalogues (SNIa), including the DES-SN5YR and Pantheon+ compilations. We find full consistency between the standard model and the cosmographic approach when considering DESI BAO and SNIa catalogues independently. When combining DESI BAO with SNIa data, we examine the impact of the Planck prior on the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, and the Cepheid prior on the absolute magnitude, $M$. Applying the Planck prior on $r_d$ alone yields an $H_0$ value consistent with the Planck measurement, while applying the Cepheid prior on $M$ alone results in an $H_0$ value consistent with the SH0ES measurement. Without any priors, the $H_0$ value obtained has a large error margin, reconciling the Planck and SH0ES measurements. In all cases where individual priors are applied, we observe no significant tension between the flat-$\Lambda$CDM model and the cosmographic approach. However, when both Planck and Cepheid priors are applied simultaneously, significant tensions arise between the model and cosmography. This tension is even more pronounced when excluding LRG1 and LRG2 from the DESI measurements. These results suggest that the standard model cannot simultaneously align with both high-redshift Planck CMB observations and local Cepheid measurements.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Cosmology by Gamma-Ray Bursts: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from graviton Bremsstrahlung with kination phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitational three-body decay (graviton Bremsstrahlung process) can leave an indelible signal at ultrahigh frequencies. We focus on a scenario where superheavy particles are produced gravitationally at a transition between the inflationary and kination phases and analyze the detectability of the signal in the presence of GWs generated from the vacuum fluctuations during inflation. We find that, in many cases, GWs from the graviton Bremsstrahlung are buried in the stochastic gravitational wave background originating from inflation. However, if the superheavy particles are as heavy as the Planck scale, the graviton Bremsstrahlung can produce a sizable amount of GWs, surpassing the inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. I. Global Bayesian analysis of COBE-DIRBE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first global Bayesian analysis of the time-ordered DIRBE data within the Cosmoglobe framework, building on the same methodology that has previously been successfully applied to Planck LFI and WMAP. These data are analyzed jointly with COBE-FIRAS, Gaia, Planck HFI, and WISE, allowing for more accurate instrumental and astrophysical characterization than possible through single-experiment analysis. This paper provides an overview of the analysis pipeline and main results, and we present and characterize a new set of zodiacal light subtracted mission average (ZSMA) DIRBE maps spanning 1.25 to 240 $\mu$m. A novel aspect of this processing is the characterization and removal of excess radiation between 4.9 and 60$\,\mu$m that appears static in solar-centric coordinates. The DR2 ZSMA maps have several advantages with respect to the previously available maps, including 1) lower zodiacal light (and possibly straylight) residuals; 2) better determined zero-levels; 3) natively HEALPix tessellated maps with a $7'$ pixel size; 4) nearly white noise at pixel scales; and 5) a more complete and accurate noise characterization established through the combination of MCMC samples and half-mission maps. In addition, because the model has been simultaneously fitted with both DIRBE and HFI data, this is the first consistent unification of the infrared and CMB wavelength ranges into one global sky model covering 100 GHz to 1 $\mu$m. However, even though the new maps are improved with respect to the official maps, and should be preferred for most future analyses that require DIRBE sky maps, they still exhibit non-negligible zodiacal light residuals between 12 and 60$\,\mu$m. Further improvements should be made through joint analysis with complementary infrared experiments such IRAS, AKARI, WISE and SPHEREx, and releasing the full combined potential of all these powerful infrared observatories.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is identical to that introduced by Kelsall et al. (1998), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 5\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 Zodiacal light Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 10$ kJy/sr at 1.25-3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. The total RMS of each DR2 map at wavelengths up to and including 25 $\mu$m are $\sim 30$ $\%$ lower at high Galactic latitudes than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA maps. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with existing and future high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31 measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing, megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean $H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements, indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Detection of the large-scale tidal field with galaxy multiplet alignment in the DESI Y1 spectroscopic survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore correlations between the orientations of small galaxy groups, or "multiplets", and the large-scale gravitational tidal field. Using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Y1 survey, we detect the intrinsic alignment (IA) of multiplets to the galaxy-traced matter field out to separations of 100 Mpc/h. Unlike traditional IA measurements of individual galaxies, this estimator is not limited by imaging of galaxy shapes and allows for direct IA detection beyond redshift z = 1. Multiplet alignment is a form of higher-order clustering, for which the scale-dependence traces the underlying tidal field and amplitude is a result of small-scale (&lt; 1 Mpc/h) dynamics. Within samples of bright galaxies (BGS), luminous red galaxies (LRG) and emission-line galaxies (ELG), we find similar scale-dependence regardless of intrinsic luminosity or colour. This is promising for measuring tidal alignment in galaxy samples that typically display no intrinsic alignment. DESI's LRG mock galaxy catalogues created from the AbacusSummit N-body simulations produce a similar alignment signal, though with a 33% lower amplitude at all scales. An analytic model using a non-linear power spectrum (NLA) only matches the signal down to 20 Mpc/h. Our detection demonstrates that galaxy clustering in the non-linear regime of structure formation preserves an interpretable memory of the large-scale tidal field. Multiplet alignment complements traditional two-point measurements by retaining directional information imprinted by tidal forces, and contains additional line-of-sight information compared to weak lensing. This is a more effective estimator than the alignment of individual galaxies in dense, blue, or faint galaxy samples.</description>

      <title>A novel probe of graviton dispersion relations at nano-Hertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalise Phinney's 'practical theorem' to account for modified graviton dispersion relations motivated by certain cosmological scenarios. Focusing on specific examples, we show how such modifications can induce characteristic localised distortions, bumps, in the frequency profile of the stochastic gravitational wave background emitted from distant binary sources. We concentrate on gravitational waves at nano-Hertz frequencies probed by pulsar timing arrays, and we forecast the capabilities of future experiments to accurately probe parameters controlling modified dispersion relations. Our predictions are based on properties of gravitational waves emitted in the first inspiral phase of the binary process, and do not rely on assumptions of non-linear effects occurring during the binary merging phase</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking, gauge hierarchy and electroweak vacuum metastability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called metastability bound asserts that an unnaturally small Higgs mass is a necessary condition for electroweak vacuum metastability, offering a new approach towards solving the hierarchy problem. So far, this result relies on the assumption of a negative Higgs mass parameter, or equivalently, on electroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We derive a new, corresponding bound for the case of a positive mass parameter. When the new bound is significantly more restrictive than or comparable to its established counterpart, it may offer an explanation for the sign of the Higgs mass parameter, and thus, spontaneous symmetry breaking itself. New physics at scales $\mathcal{O} (1-10)$ TeV can lower these bounds as far as the TeV-scale. As an illustration, we consider vacuum stability in the presence of additional TeV-scale fermions with Yukawa couplings to the Higgs, as well as a dimension-six term parameterizing new physics in the UV. This scenario requires new physics that couples strongly to the Higgs, and can potentially be probed at future colliders. Finally, to allow for comparison with concrete mechanisms predicting metastability, we provide the mass-dependent lifetime of the electroweak vacuum for this model.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Lensing Tomography of Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

      <title>Not-so-little Red Dots: Two massive and dusty starbursts at z~5-7 pushing the limits of star formation discovered by JWST in the COSMOS-Web survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the properties of two candidate massive ($M_\star\sim10^{11}M_\odot$) and dusty ($A_{\rm v}&gt;2.5$ mag) galaxies at $z=5-7$ in the first 0.28 deg$^2$ of the COSMOS-Web survey. One object is spectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\rm spec}=5.051$, while the other has a robust $z_{\rm phot}=6.7\pm0.3$. Thanks to their extremely red colors ($F277W-F444W\sim1.7$ mag), these galaxies satisfy the nominal color-selection for the widely-studied ``little red dot" (LRD) population with the exception of their spatially-resolved morphologies. The morphology of our targets allows us to conclude that their red continuum is dominated by highly obscured stellar emission and not by reddened nuclear activity. Using a variety of SED-fitting tools and star formation histories, we estimate the stellar masses to be $\log(M_\star)=11.32^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$ $M_\odot$ and $\log(M_\star)=11.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ $M_\odot$, respectively, with a red continuum emission dominated by a recent episode of star formation. We then compare their number density to the halo mass function to infer stellar baryon fractions of $\epsilon_\star\sim0.25$ and $\epsilon_\star\sim0.5$. Both are significantly higher than what is commonly observed in lower-z galaxies or more dust-obscured galaxies at similar redshifts. With very bright ultra-high-z Lyman-Break Galaxies and some non-AGN dominated LRDs, such ``extended" LRDs represent another population that may require very efficient star formation at early times.</description>

      <title>Project Dinos II: Redshift evolution of dark and luminous matter density profiles in strong-lensing elliptical galaxies across $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.9$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new measurement of the dark and luminous matter distribution of massive elliptical galaxies, and their evolution with redshift, by combining strong lensing and dynamical observables. Our sample of 58 lens galaxies covers a redshift range of $0.090\leq z_{\rm l}\leq0.884$. By combining new Hubble Space Telescope imaging with previously observed velocity dispersion and line-of-sight measurements, we decompose the luminous matter profile from the dark matter profile and perform a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to constrain the population-level properties of both profiles. We find that the inner slope of the dark matter density profile ("cusp"; $\rho_{\rm DM}\propto r^{-\gamma_{\rm in}}$) is slightly steeper ($\mu_{\gamma_{\rm in}}=1.18^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ at $z=0.35$ with $\leq0.16$ intrinsic scatter) than a standard Navarro$-$Frenk$-$White (NFW; $\gamma_{\rm in}=1$), with an appreciable evolution with redshift ($d\log(\gamma_{\rm in})/dz=-0.33\pm0.13$) and is consistent with NFW-like distributions at higher redshifts ($z\geq0.56$ for $\leq1\sigma$ consistency). Additionally, we find the stellar mass-to-light ratio at the population level consistent with that of a Salpeter initial mass function, a small stellar mass-to-light gradient ($\kappa_{*}(r)\propto r^{-\eta}$, with $\overline{\eta}\leq9.4\times10^{-3}$), and isotropic stellar orbits. Our averaged total mass density profile is consistent with a power-law profile within $0.25-4$ Einstein radii ($\overline{\gamma}=2.14\pm0.06$), with an internal mass-sheet transformation parameter $\overline{\lambda}=1.02\pm0.01$ consistent with no mass sheet. Our findings confirm the validity of the standard mass models used for time-delay cosmography. However, our results are in strong tension with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations such as IllustrisTNG, highlighting the need to better understand the formation of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Carousel Lens: A Well-Modeled Strong Lens with Multiple Lensed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years alone, the lensing community has discovered thousands of strong lens candidates, and spectroscopically confirmed hundreds of them. In this time of abundance, it becomes pragmatic to focus our time and resources on the few extraordinary systems, in order to most efficiently study the universe. In this paper, we present such a system: DESI-090.9854-35.9683, a cluster-scale lens at $z_{\rm l} = 0.49$, with seven observed lensed sources around the core, and additional lensed sources further out in the cluster. From the number and the textbook configuration of the lensed images, a tight constraint on the mass potential of the lens is possible. This would allow for detailed analysis on the dark and luminous matter content within galaxy clusters, as well as a probe into dark energy and high-redshift galaxies. We present our spatially resolved kinematic measurements of this system from the Very Large Telescope Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, which confirm five of these source galaxies (in ascending order, at $z_{\rm s} = 0.962, 0.962, 1.166, 1.432,$ and $1.432$). With previous Hubble Space Telescope imaging in the F140W and F200LP bands, we also present a simple two power-law profile flux-based lens model that, for a cluster lens, well models the five lensed arc families with redshifts. We determine the mass to be $M(&lt; \theta_{\rm E}) = 4.78\times10^{13} M_{\odot}$ for the primary mass potential. From the model, we extrapolate the redshift of one of the two source galaxies not yet spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z_{\rm s}=4.52^{+1.03}_{-0.71}$.</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster profiles: A Gaussian mixture model approach to halo miscentering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the galaxy density and weak-lensing profiles of galaxy clusters typically rely on an assumed cluster center, which is taken to be the brightest cluster galaxy or other proxies for the true halo center. Departure of the assumed cluster center from the true halo center bias the resultant profile measurements, an effect known as miscentering bias. Currently, miscentering is typically modeled in stacked profiles of clusters with a two parameter model. We use an alternate approach in which the profiles of individual clusters are used with the corresponding likelihood computed using a Gaussian mixture model. We test the approach using halos and the corresponding subhalo profiles from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulations. We obtain significantly improved estimates of the miscentering parameters for both 3D and projected 2D profiles relevant for imaging surveys. We discuss applications to upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Tolerance to Astrophysical Model Uncertainty in Dark Siren Hubble Measurement with Third-generation Gravitational-wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) events can serve as standard sirens for cosmology, as the luminosity distance to source can be directly measured from the waveform amplitude. Specifically, the ``dark'' siren method involves inferring cosmological parameters, e.g. the Hubble constant, by comparing the luminosity distance distribution and that of the redshift, typically obtained through a combination of galaxy survey catalog and theoretical models. Especially with the prospect of third-generation GW detectors, the statistical uncertainty of the Hubble measurement can be suppressed to a percent level. However, incorrect assumption in galaxy population models can lead to systematic bias, which becomes increasingly relevant as third-generation GW detectors can detect large-redshift sources beyond the reach of currently available galaxy catalogs. In this work, we adopt a Fisher information formalism and study the maximum model error tolerance given specific total error budget. We find that, to achieve a total error budget of 1% in the Hubble constant, the galaxy mass function redshift evolution should be known to O(1%). We find that galaxy redshift uncertainty, survey magnitude limit and GW angular localization error are important factors. We find galaxy clustering also improves model error tolerance, thus our results provide a conservative benchmark to future analysis using real galaxy catalogs. We also investigate the effective bright siren scenario and highlight that the dark siren selection strategy should be catered to measurement uncertainty and the target total error budget. This work thus highlights the challenge in the dark siren method and quantifies requirements on both the galaxy catalog and GW measurement to contribute to constraining cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SPIDER is a balloon-borne instrument designed to map the cosmic microwave background at degree-angular scales in the presence of Galactic foregrounds. SPIDER has mapped a large sky area in the Southern Hemisphere using more than 2000 transition-edge sensors (TESs) during two NASA Long Duration Balloon flights above the Antarctic continent. During its first flight in January 2015, SPIDER observed in the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, setting constraints on the B-mode signature of primordial gravitational waves. Its second flight in the 2022-23 season added new receivers at 280 GHz, each using an array of TESs coupled to the sky through feedhorns formed from stacks of silicon wafers. These receivers are optimized to produce deep maps of polarized Galactic dust emission over a large sky area, providing a unique data set with lasting value to the field. In this work, we describe the instrument's performance during SPIDER's second flight.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of non-thermally produced dark matter on large-scale structure formation, focusing on the gravitino dark matter. Our analysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data offer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos. Specifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a fraction $F_\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data exclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\chi_1^0}\lesssim11~(25)\text{ GeV}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>On the kinematic nature of apparent discs at high redshifts: Local counterparts are not dominated by ordered rotation but by tangentially anisotropic random motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is not straightforward to physically interpret the apparent morphology of galaxies. Recent observations by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) revealed a dominant galaxy population at high redshifts ($z&gt;2$) that were visually classified as discs for their flattened shapes and/or exponential light profiles. The extensively accepted interpretation is that they are dynamically cold discs supported by bulk rotation. However, it is long known that flattened shapes and exponential profiles are not exclusive for rotating disc structure. To break degeneracy and assess the rotational support of typical high-$z$ galaxies in the JWST samples, those with active star formation and stellar masses $\mathrm{lg}(\mathcal{M}_{\star}/\mathcal{M}_{\odot})\sim9$, we study the kinematics of their equal-mass counterparts at $z=0$. While these local star-forming low-mass galaxies are photometrically similar to real dynamically cold discs, they are not supported by ordered rotation but primarily by random motion, and their flattened shapes result largely from tangential orbital anisotropy. Given the empirical and theoretical evidence that young galaxies are dynamically hotter at higher redshifts, our results suggest that the high-$z$ JWST galaxies may not be cold discs but are dynamically warm/hot galaxies with flattened shapes driven by anisotropy. While both having low rotational support, local low-mass galaxies possess oblate shapes, contrasting the prolate shapes (i.e. cigar-like) of low-mass systems at high redshifts. Such shape transition (prolate$\Rightarrow$oblate) indicates an associated change in orbital anisotropy (radial$\Rightarrow$tangential), with roots likely in the assembly of their host dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Gravitational effects on fluid dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

      <title>CMB Implications of Multi-field Axio-dilaton Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton models are among the simplest scalar-tensor theories that contain the two-derivative interactions that naturally compete at low energies with the two-derivative inter-actions of General Relativity. Such models are well-motivated as the low energy fields arising from string theory compactification. We summarize these motivations and compute their cosmological evolution, in which the dilaton acts as dark energy and its evolution provides a framework for dynamically evolving particle masses. The derivative axion-dilaton couplings play an important role in the success of these cosmologies. We derive the equations for fluctuations needed to study their implications for the CMB anisotropy, matter spectra and structure growth. We use a modified Boltzmann code to study in detail four benchmark parameter choices, including the vanilla Yoga model, and identify couplings that give viable cosmologies, including some with surprisingly large matter-scalar interactions. The axion has negligible potential for most of the cosmologies we consider but we also examine a simplified model for which the axion potential plays a role, using axion-matter couplings motivated by phenomenological screening considerations. We find such choices can also lead to viable cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Radio U-Net: a convolutional neural network to detect diffuse radio sources in galaxy clusters and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of radio telescope arrays promises significant advancements in sensitivity and resolution, enabling the identification and characterization of many new faint and diffuse radio sources. Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with initial mass $\sim5\times10^{14}$ g are evaporating due to Hawking radiation, leading to bursts of very-high-energy gamma rays. In this work, we investigate the prospective sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to measure the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our findings reveal that LHAASO is capable of searching for the PBH bursts within a distance $\sim0.1$ pc from the sun and thereby measure the local burst rate density $\sim$ 1164 (or 699)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $99\%$ confidence level during a 3 (or 5) year observing run. This stands for a sensitivity that is one order of magnitude stronger than the strongest observational constraint from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). In addition, we further suggest an observing strategy to search for the PBH bursts during upcoming observing runs of LHAASO.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV gamma-ray emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 with six years of DAMPE data</title>

Abstract: We search for gamma-ray emission from the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 in the energy range from 3 GeV to 1 TeV using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) telescope. For our analysis, we use three different templates: point source, radial disk and radial Gaussian. We do not detect a signal with significance $&gt;3\sigma$ for any of these templates at any location with $R_{200}$ of the cluster center. We obtain 95\% c.l. upper limit on the energy flux between $\sim 10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ depending on the energy range. These upper limits are consistent with the a non-zero flux detected by Fermi-LAT (at $6\sigma$ significance) for this cluster. This work represents the first proof of principle search for gamma-ray emission from a single galaxy cluster using DAMPE data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of cogenesis from a burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of explaining the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance, along with matter-antimatter asymmetry, entirely from the evaporation of primordial black holes (PBH) beyond the semi-classical approximation. We find that, depending on the timing of modification to the semi-classical approximation and the efficiency of the backreaction, it is possible to produce the correct DM abundance for PBHs with masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, whereas producing the right amount of baryon asymmetry requires light PBHs with masses $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, satisfying bounds on the PBH mass from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, in a simplistic scenario, achieving both {\it simultaneously} is not feasible, typically because of the stringent Lyman-$\alpha$ constraint on warm dark matter mass. In addition to DM and baryon asymmetry, we also investigate the impact of memory burden on dark radiation, evaporated from PBH, constrained by the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Furthermore, we demonstrate how induced gravitational waves from PBH density fluctuations can provide a window to test the memory-burden effects, thereby placing constraints on either the DM mass scale or the scale of leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. II. CIB monopole measurements from COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new constraints on the CIB monopole spectrum from a set of reprocessed COBE-DIRBE sky maps that have lower instrumental and astrophysical contamination than the legacy DIRBE maps. These maps have been generated through a global Bayesian analysis framework that simultaneously fits cosmological, astrophysical, and instrumental parameters, as described in a series of papers collectively referred to as Cosmoglobe DR2. We have applied this method to the DIRBE TODs, complemented by selected HFI and FIRAS sky maps to break key astrophysical degeneracies, as well as WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. In this paper, we focus on the CIB monopole constraints that result from this work. We report positive detections of an isotropic signal in six out of the ten DIRBE bands (1.25, 2.2, 3.5, 100, 140, and 240 $\mathrm{\mu m}$). For the 2.2 $\mu$m channel, we find an amplitude of $10.2\pm1.2\,\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$, 74 % lower than that reported from the official DIRBE maps. For the 240 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ channel, we find $6\pm3\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$, 56 % lower than the official DIRBE release. We interpret these lower values as resulting from improved zodiacal light and Galactic foreground modeling. For the bands between 4.9 and 60 $\mu\mathrm{m}$, the presence of excess radiation in solar-centric coordinates precludes the definition of lower limits. However, the analysis still provides well-defined upper limits. For the 12 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ channel, we find an upper 95 % confidence limit of 55 $\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$, more than a factor of eight lower than the corresponding legacy result of 468 $\mathrm{nW\,m^{-2}\,sr^{-1}}$. The results presented in this paper redefine the state-of-the-art CIB monopole constraints from COBE-DIRBE, and provide a real-world illustration of the power of global end-to-end analysis of multiple complementary datasets.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Slow supernovae show cosmological time dilation out to $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of cosmological time dilation using the light curves of 1504 type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey spanning a redshift range $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 1.2$. We find that the width of supernova light curves is proportional to $(1+z)$, as expected for time dilation due to the expansion of the Universe. Assuming type Ia supernovae light curves are emitted with a consistent duration $\Delta t_{\rm em}$, and parameterising the observed duration as $\Delta t_{\rm obs}=\Delta t_{\rm em}(1+z)^b$, we fit for the form of time dilation using two methods. Firstly, we find that a power of $b \approx 1$ minimises the flux scatter in stacked subsamples of light curves across different redshifts. Secondly, we fit each target supernova to a stacked light curve (stacking all supernovae with observed bandpasses matching that of the target light curve) and find $b=1.003\pm0.005$ (stat) $\pm\,0.010$ (sys). Thanks to the large number of supernovae and large redshift-range of the sample, this analysis gives the most precise measurement of cosmological time dilation to date, ruling out any non-time-dilating cosmological models at very high significance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize and explain the current status of variations of fundamental masses in cosmology, with a particular focus on variations of the electron mass. We show that electron mass variations not only allow for significant easing of the Hubble tension but are also preferred at a decent level of significance using the latest DESI data (between $2\sigma$ and $3.6\sigma$ depending on the model and the data). This extreme success of the model is neither tightly constrained from light element abundances generated during big bang nucleosynthesis nor from post-recombination observations using quasars and atomic clocks, though future data is expected to give strong evidence in favor of or against this model. Models of baryon mass variations, on the other hand, are shown to generally not be cosmologically interesting.</description>

      <title>Revised LOFAR upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $\mathbf{z\approx9.1}$ using Machine Learning and Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for foregrounds mitigation in data collected by the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to measure the high-redshift 21-cm signal power spectrum has been shown to have issues of signal loss when the 21-cm signal covariance is misestimated. To address this problem, we have recently introduced covariance kernels obtained by using a Machine Learning based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) algorithm in combination with simulations of the 21-cm signal. In this work, we apply this framework to 141 hours ($\approx 10$ nights) of LOFAR data at $z \approx 9.1$, and report revised upper limits of the 21-cm signal power spectrum. Overall, we agree with past results reporting a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (80)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. Further, the VAE-based kernel has a smaller correlation with the systematic excess noise, and the overall GPR-based approach is shown to be a good model for the data. Assuming an accurate bias correction for the excess noise, we report a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^2_{21} &lt; (25)^2~\rm mK^2$ at $k = 0.075~h~\rm Mpc^{-1}$. However, we still caution to take the more conservative approach to jointly report the upper limits of the excess noise and the 21-cm signal components.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy of the triply-lensed $z = 10.17$ galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed $z \sim 11$ candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift $z=10.17$ based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, [OII] $\lambda$3727, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, [NeIII] $\lambda$3968, H$\delta$ $\lambda$4101, H$\gamma$ $\lambda$4340, and [OIII] $\lambda$4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity $Z =$ log(O/H) = $7.5 - 8.0$, or $(0.06 - 0.2)$ $Z_\odot$, ionization parameter log($U$) $\sim -1.9\pm0.2$, and an ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,$erg$^{-1}$ Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyman-$\alpha$ break, evidence for a strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings beyond its immediate vicinity ($R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1$ pMpc). The Ly$\alpha$ damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift $z = 10.6 \pm 0.3$. MACS0647-JD has a stellar mass log($M/M_\odot$) = $8.1 \pm 0.3$, including $\sim$ 6$\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in component A, most of which formed recently (within $\sim$ 20 Myr) with a star formation rate $2\pm1 M_\odot$ / yr, all within an effective radius $70\pm24\,$pc. The smaller component B ($r \sim 20$) pc is likely older ($\sim$100 Myr) with more dust ($A_V \sim 0.1$ mag), as found previously. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\ 3$\,$kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with $z = 10.17$. MACS0647-JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.</description>

      <title>An Estimate of the Impact of Reionization on Supermassive Black Hole Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that power active galactic nuclei found at $z &gt; 6$ were formed during the epoch of reionization. Because reionization is an inhomogeneous process, the physical properties of SMBH host galaxy environments will vary spatially during reionization. We construct a semi-analytic model to estimate the impact of reionization on SMBH growth. Using a series of merger trees, reionization models, and black hole growth models, we find that early reionization can reduce an SMBH's mass by up to [50, 70, 90] % within dark matter halos of mass [$10^{12}$, $10^{11}$, $10^{10}$] M$_{\odot}$ by $z$ = 6. Our findings also suggest that the redshift range in which black hole growth is impacted by reionization strongly depends on whether the Eddington accretion rate can be exceeded. If so, we find that black hole masses are significantly suppressed principally during the early phases of reionization ($z$ &gt; 10), while they are more readily suppressed across the full redshift range if super-Eddington growth is not allowed. We find that the global average impact of reionization may be to reduce the masses of black holes residing in &lt; 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$ halos by a factor of &gt; 2. The census of supermassive black holes being uncovered by the James Webb Space Telescope may offer a means to test the basic prediction that more massive black holes reside in cosmological volumes that are reionized at later times.</description>

      <title>No massive black holes in the Milky Way halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter. This conclusively rules out primordial black hole mergers as a dominant source of gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the properties of total time-derivative terms as well as terms proportional to the free equation of motion (EOM) in a Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. They are relevant to the correct calculation of correlation functions of curvature perturbations in the context of inflationary Universe. We show that these two contributions to the action play different roles in the operator or the path-integral formalism, but they give the same correlation functions as each other. As a concrete example, we confirm that the Maldacena's consistency relations for the three-point correlation function in the slow-roll inflationary scenario driven by a minimally coupled canonical scalar field hold in both the operator and path-integral formalisms. We also give some comments on loop calculations.</description>

      <title>JWST MIRI detections of H$\alpha$ and [O III] and direct metallicity measurement of the $z=10.17$ lensed galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>

Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has revolutionized our understanding of galaxies in the early universe. Covering wavelengths up to $5.3\,{\rm \mu m}$, NIRSpec can detect rest-frame optical emission lines H$\alpha$ out to $z = 7$ and [O III] to $z = 9.5$. Observing these lines in more distant galaxies requires longer wavelength spectroscopy with MIRI. Here we present MIRI MRS IFU observations of the lensed galaxy merger MACS0647$-$JD at $z = 10.165$. With exposure times of 4.2 hours in each of two bands, we detect H$\alpha$ at $9\sigma$, [O III]$\,\lambda5008$ at $11\sigma$, and [O III]$\,\lambda4960$ at $3\sigma$. Combined with previously reported NIRSpec spectroscopy that yields seven emission lines including the auroral line [O III]$\,\lambda4363$, we present the first direct metallicity measurement of a $z &gt; 10$ galaxy: $12+{\rm log(O/H)}= 7.79\pm0.09$, or $0.13^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\,Z_{\odot}$. This is similar to galaxies at $z \sim 4 - 9$ with direct metallicity measurements, though higher than expected given the high specific star formation rate ${\rm log(sSFR / yr^{-1})} = -7.4 \pm 0.3$. We further constrain the ionization parameter ${\rm log}(U)$ = $-1.9 \pm 0.1$, ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})$ = $25.3\pm0.1$, and star formation rate $5.0\pm0.6\,M_{\odot}/{\rm yr}$ within the past $10\,{\rm Myr}$. These observations demonstrate the combined power of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI for studying galaxies in the first $500$ million years.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quintessence: curved, steep and stringy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that our universe's current accelerated expansion is explained by a quintessence model with an exponential scalar potential, $V =V_0\, e^{-\lambda\, \phi}$, keeping an eye towards $\lambda \geq \sqrt{2}$ and an open universe, favorable to a string theory realisation and with no cosmological horizon. We work out the full cosmology of the model, including matter, radiation, and optionally negative spatial curvature, for all $\lambda&gt;0$, performing an extensive analysis of the dynamical system and its phase space. The minimal physical requirements of a past epoch of radiation domination and an accelerated expansion today lead to an upper bound $\lambda \lesssim \sqrt{3}$, which is driven slightly up in the presence of observationally allowed spatial curvature. Cosmological solutions start universally in a kination epoch, go through radiation and matter dominated phases and enter an epoch of acceleration, which is only transient for $\lambda&gt;\sqrt{2}$. Field distances traversed between BBN and today are sub-Planckian. We discuss possible string theory origins and phenomenological challenges, such as time variation of fundamental constants. We provide theoretical predictions for the model parameters to be fitted to data, most notably the varying dark energy equation of state parameter, in light of recent results from DES-Y5 and DESI.</description>

      <title>Coupled phantom cosmological model motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a coupled phantom dark-energy cosmological model in which the coupling term between a phantom scalar field with an exponential potential and a pressureless dark-matter fluid is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm. Using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems, complemented by numerical solutions of the evolution equations, we study the late-time behavior of our model. We show that contrary to the uncoupled scenario, the coupled phantom model admits accelerated scaling solutions. However, they do not correspond to a final state of the universe's evolution and, therefore, cannot be used to solve the cosmological coincidence problem. Furthermore, we show that, for certain coupling parameter values, the total equation-of-state parameter's asymptotic behavior is significantly changed when compared to the uncoupled scenario, allowing for solutions less phantom even for steeper potentials of the phantom scalar field.</description>
