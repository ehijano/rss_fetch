      <title>Distinguishing the origin of eccentric black-hole mergers with gravitational-wave spin measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim40\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim80\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Origin of the X-ray emission in blazars through multiwavelength polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the high-energy emission in astrophysical jets from black holes is a highly debated issue. This is particularly true for jets from supermassive black holes that are among the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. So far, the addition of new observations and new messengers have only managed to create more questions than answers. However, the newly available X-ray polarization observations promise to finally distinguish between emission models. We use extensive multiwavelength and polarization campaigns as well as state-of-the-art polarized spectral energy distribution models to attack this problem by focusing on two X-ray polarization observations of blazar BL Lacertae in flaring and quiescent $\gamma$-ray states. We find that regardless of the jet composition and underlying emission model, inverse-Compton scattering from relativistic electrons dominates at X-ray energies.</description>

      <title>Multipole Analysis and Application to Supernova Remnant X-ray Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a multipole analysis method for images with a circular boundary, then apply it to supernova remnant (SNR) images. The morphology of SNR images is related to several factors, including the inhomogeneities of the supernova ejecta and of the circumstellar medium in which the ejecta and shock wave travel. The current multipole method corrects some errors in a previously presented method, and applies the new analysis to test for differences in X-ray image morphology between Type Ia and core-collapse type SNRs. We find there is no clear difference between the two SNR types in morphology as measured by multipole moments.</description>

      <title>The plunging region of a thin accretion disc around a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of analytic solutions for the plunging region thermodynamics have been developed recently under the assumption that the fluid undergoes a gravity-dominated geodesic plunge into the black hole. We test this model against a dedicated 3D global GRMHD simulation of a thin accretion disc around a Schwarzschild black hole using the code AthenaK. Provided that we account for non-adiabatic heating in the energetics, plausibly from grid-scale magnetic dissipation, we find an excellent agreement between the analytic model and the simulated quantities. These results are particularly important for existing and future electromagnetic black hole spin measurements, many of which do not to include the plunging fluid in their emission modelling. This exclusion typically stems from the assumption of a zero-stress boundary condition at the ISCO, forcing all thermodynamic quantities to vanish. Instead, we find a non-zero $\delta_\mathcal{J}\approx 5.3 \%$ drop in the angular momentum over the plunging region, which is consistent with both prior simulations and observations. We demonstrate that this stress is small enough for the dynamics of the fluid in the plunging region to be well-described by geodesic trajectories, yet large enough to cause measurable dissipation near to the ISCO - keeping thermodynamic quantities from vanishing. In the plunging region, constant $\alpha$-disc models are a physically inappropriate framework.</description>

      <title>Orbital Phase-resolved Analysis of X-ray and Gamma-ray Observations of the High-Mass Gamma-ray Binary 4FGL J1405.1-6119</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of multi-wavelength observations of the High-Mass Gamma-Ray Binary 4FGL J1405.1-6119. A pair of joint XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations taken in 2019 (sampling the gamma-ray maximum and X-ray maximum) characterize the emission of soft and hard X-rays. We find variability of the hydrogen column density along our line of sight, $N_{\rm H}$, and photon index, $\Gamma$, and find no evidence of pulsations in X-rays. We also refine a new best-fit orbital period to $P=13.7157\pm0.0014$ days, the first orbital phase-resolved analysis based on nearly 16 years of Fermi--LAT observations of 4FGL J1405.1-6119 and the evolution of the spectral shape as a function of orbital phase. Finally, the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray spectra for the phases sampled in the new X-ray observations can be interpreted in the framework of the intrabinary shock model, previously applied to High-Mass Gamma-Ray binaries such as LS 5039.</description>

      <title>XRISM Reveals a Remnant Torus in the Low-Luminosity AGN M81*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Up to 40% of galaxies in the local universe host a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), making it vital to understand this mode of black hole accretion. However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM/Resolve spectrum of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak, neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\alpha,1}$ and K$_{\alpha,2}$ components. It shows a negligible velocity shift, and weak broadening (FWHM$=460^{+260}_{-160}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) that corresponds to an inner emission radius of ${\rm r} \geq 2.7\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$ for likely inclinations. The Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line likely traces a torus. The upper limit on additional splitting of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line components translates to a limit on the local magnetic field of ${\rm B} \leq 3.5\times 10^{8}$ Gauss, assuming Zeeman splitting. The spectra also reveal ionized plasma(s) through He-like Fe XXV and H-like Fe XXVI emission lines. These can be fit equally well assuming photoionization and collisional excitation. The H-like Fe XXVI line is better described when a second component is included with a red-shift of ${\rm v} = 1600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, but this addition is of marginal statistical significance. We discuss these results in the context of radiatively inefficient accretion flow models, magnetically arrested disks, and possible links to the Fermi bubbles in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>TransFit: An Efficient Framework for Transient Light-Curve Fitting with Time-Dependent Radiative Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling the light curves (LCs) of luminous astronomical transients, such as supernovae, is crucial for understanding their progenitor physics, particularly with the exponential growth of survey data. However, existing methods face limitations: efficient semi-analytical models (e.g., Arnett-like) employ significant physical simplifications (like time-invariant temperature profiles and simplified heating distributions), often compromising accuracy, especially for early-time LCs. Conversely, detailed numerical radiative transfer simulations, while accurate, are computationally prohibitive for large datasets. This paper introduces TransFit, a novel framework that numerically solves a generalized energy conservation equation, explicitly incorporating time-dependent radiative diffusion, continuous radioactive or central engine heating, and ejecta expansion dynamics. The model accurately captures the influence of key ejecta properties and diverse heating source characteristics on light curve morphology, including peak luminosity, rise time, and overall shape. Furthermore, TransFit provides self-consistent modeling of the transition from shock-cooling to $^{56}$Ni}-powered light curves. By combining physical realism with computational speed, TransFit provides a powerful tool for efficiently inverting LCs and extracting detailed physical insights from the vast datasets of current and future transient surveys.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Cyclic Spectroscopy in the Partial-Deconvolution Regime: Benefits &amp; Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore possible advantages of cyclic spectroscopy for observations of pulsars in instances where full cyclic deconvolution is not feasible. We compute cyclic merits and full-deconvolution regime boundaries for pulsars observed by NANOGrav and discuss which sources stand to benefit the most from using cyclic spectroscopy when observed with the Green Bank Telescope and DSA-2000 in a given frequency range. We compare data products, namely the wavefield, in both full-deconvolution and partial-deconvolution regimes to demonstrate what can be accomplished with incomplete phase retrieval. Additionally, we show how some phase retrieval can still be achieved in the partial-deconvolution regime and how this allows for additional information in scintillation-based data products, like the dynamic wavefield power, compared to what can be found in traditional dynamic spectra. An examination of dynamic wavefield phase as a function of observing frequency reveals more complete phase retrieval is achieved the closer one gets to the full deconvolution regime, agreeing with the expectations of cyclic merit. While we demonstrate that fragmentary recovery of the secondary wavefield can be accomplished in the partial-deconvolution regime, we advocate for a synergistic approach with phase retrieval methods like the $\theta-\theta$ transform, although we also provide discussion about shortcomings of this strategy. Finally, we use the combination of modest cyclic merit and lack of discernible results for PSR J1903$+$0327 to motivate the creation of an updated "cyclic merit 2.0", which relies on scintillation bandwidth instead of observing bandwidth.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the parsec-scale jet in the neutrino blazar PKS 0735+178</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS 0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories. We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during 2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208. We discuss the physical implications of these findings.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional Models of Mixed H/He Flames in X-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of mixed H/He flames in X-ray bursts using 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We find that as the initial hydrogen abundance of the atmosphere increases, the flame is less energetic and propagates slower. The simulation outcome, whether a flame forms and whether there's runaway burning at the base of the atmosphere, is very sensitive to the initial model and the nuclear reaction network used. We also see that at late times a secondary flame ignites, with the ignition mechanism dependent on the composition.</description>

      <title>Accretion of AGN Stars under Influence of Disk Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars can form within or be captured by AGN disks, influencing both the thermal structure and metallicity of the disk environment. In a previous work, we investigated isotropic accretion onto massive stars from a gas-rich, high-entropy background. Here, we consider a more realistic scenario by incorporating the stratified geometry of the background disk in our 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulatons. We find that accretion remains relatively isotropic when the disk is hot enough and the scale height is thicker than the accretion flow's nominal supersonic critical radius $R{crit}$ (sub-thermal). However, when the disk becomes cold, the accretion flow becomes significantly anisotropic (super-thermal). Escaping stellar and accretion luminosity can drive super-Eddington outflows in the polar region, while rapid accretion is sustained along the midplane. Eventually, the effective cross-section is constrained by the Hill radius and the disk scale height rather than the critical radius when the disk is cold enough. For our setup (stellar mass $\sim 50 M\odot$ and background density $\rho\sim 10^{-10}$ g/cm$^3$) the accretion rates is capped below $\sim 0.02M\odot$/year and the effective accretion parameter $\alpha\sim 10^{-1}$ over disk temperature range $3 - 7 \times 10^4$ K. Spiral arms facilitate inward mass flux by driving outward angular momentum transport. Gap-opening effects may further reduce the long-term accretion rate, albeit to confirm which requires global simulations evolved over much longer viscous timescales.</description>

      <title>No Evidence for Second-Scale Periodicity in FRB 20201124A from FAST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright and short radio flashes of cosmological origin. Although a great number of FRBs were detected in the last two decades, their progenitors and the physical processes that create them are unknown. In recent years, magnetars have been proposed as one of the leading progenitor candidates. A striking feature that can hint at such a magnetar origin is second-scale periodicity. In this paper, we define a robust procedure to search for such periodicity and estimate the significance of its results. We search for such periodicity in the bursts of FRB 20201124A, observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) between April and June 2021. Our analysis does not find any significant periodicity. We discuss the differences between our non-detection and the ~1.7s periodicity claim by C. Du et al. (2025).</description>

      <title>Cen A hotspot in Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays illuminated by M83 or Cen A?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard assumption about the influence of the turbulent intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF) on the images of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) sources is that the latter are formed in a random walk mode in the deflection angle. As a result, the images are symmetrically broadened to angular scales proportional to the IGMF strength and the square root of its correlation length. We demonstrate that when the size of the emitting region is smaller than the correlation length of the IGMF, a new focusing regime emerges. In this regime, significant deviations from the standard random walk approximation occur even when the distance between the source and the observer exceeds several tens of IGMF correlation lengths. The angular size of the resulting images is typically smaller than predicted by random walk, and the IGMF causes a systematic shift of the entire image away from the true source direction. This introduces additional uncertainty in the search for UHECR sources. We show that the excess observed by Pierre Auger Observatory in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of M83, provided that the image shift occurs as predicted by some models of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) and that the IGMF plays a minor role due to its low strength and short coherence length. Alternatively, Cen A may indeed be the true source of the excess, as certain realizations of the IGMF can compensate the deflection caused by the GMF.</description>

      <title>Counterpart-Induced Millisecond-Scale Truncation Mechanism of Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed millisecond-scale duration is an essential yet mysterious feature of fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this Letter, we link the observed soft gamma-ray counterpart of FRB 200428 to electron-positron pair cascades driven by Compton scattering and the Breit-Wheeler process. We demonstrate that such pair cascades can truncate FRBs to durations down to millisecond-scale, thereby establishing millisecond-scale upper bounds on their durations. The physical processes involved in the truncation mechanism occur during the propagation of FRBs after their production. Consequently, this mechanism is independent of the specific production mechanism or origin of the FRBs, suggesting that it could potentially operate in all FRBs. Our results lift the constraint on FRB production mechanisms that they must inherently generate bursts lasting only milliseconds.</description>

      <title>First Identification and Precise Spectral Measurement of the Proton Component in the Cosmic-Ray `Knee'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first high-purity identification of cosmic-ray (CR) protons and a precise measurement of their energy spectrum from 0.15 to 12 PeV using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Abundant event statistics, combined with the simultaneous detection of electrons/photons, muons, and Cherenkov light in air showers, enable spectroscopic measurements with statistical and systematic accuracy comparable to satellite data at lower energies. The proton spectrum shows significant hardening relative to low-energy extrapolations, culminating at 3 PeV, followed by sharp softening. This distinct spectral structure - closely aligned with the knee in the all-particle spectrum - points to the emergence of a new CR component at PeV energies, likely linked to the dozens of PeVatrons recently discovered by LHAASO, and offers crucial clues to the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>Can local White Dwarfs constrain Dark Matter interactions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether nearby white dwarfs (WDs) can constrain dark matter (DM) interactions with ordinary matter. As experimental sensitivity improves, driven by the Gaia mission, the sample volume of nearby WDs has been increasing over recent years. We carefully select a sample of ten cold, isolated, non-magnetic WDs within 13~pc of the Sun. We model their carbon-oxygen interior using a finite temperature relativistic equation of state and model atmospheres to infer their core temperatures. This enables us to perform a thorough estimation of the DM capture rate and evaporation mass using actual astrophysical observations. Given the low local DM density, we focus on DM that annihilates into long-lived mediators, which escape the WD and later decay into photons. While \textit{Fermi}-LAT data shows no significant gamma-ray excess, future telescopes, CTA North \&amp; South, LHAASO, SWGO, could probe DM-nucleon cross sections down to $\sim 10^{-41}~\text{cm}^2$ for DM masses above the TeV scale. Our results are competitive with current direct detection bounds (e.g., LZ) in the multi-TeV regime. This work underscores the importance of systematic WD studies in the broader landscape of DM detection and demonstrates the synergy between astrophysical and terrestrial searches in exploring DM interactions.</description>

      <title>Unified nonparametric equation-of-state inference from the neutron-star crust to perturbative-QCD densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), while valid only at densities exceeding those found in the cores of neutron stars, could provide constraints on the dense-matter equation of state (EOS). In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a "pQCD likelihood," and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a "unified" description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) annihilation can be significantly enhanced through narrow resonances or the Sommerfeld enhancement effect, with both mechanisms potentially combining in a super-resonant annihilation process. In such scenarios, the conventional assumption that kinetic equilibrium persists until chemical decoupling may not hold, leading to substantial impacts on the final DM relic density. However, a strongly enhanced annihilation cross-section into Standard Model particles, except neutrinos, is constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations. We thus investigate DM annihilation into neutrino pair final states, focusing on the role of kinetic decoupling. We solve the coupled Boltzmann equations to determine the relic density and constrain the parameter space using current experimental data, while also forecasting the sensitivity of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Jet Tilt Instability from Stream-Disk Interactions in MAD Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetically arrested accretion disks (MADs) around a rapidly rotating black hole (BH) have been proposed as a model for jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs). However, the stream and disk interact strongly at times, and this will lead to different dynamics than expected in the standard MAD model. Here we employ global GRMHD simulations of a MAD disk interacting with an injected stream with a penetrating pericenter $R_p\sim 10 r_g$ and a range of density contrasts $f_\rho\equiv \rho_d/\rho_s$, or how dense the disk is relative to the stream. We demonstrate for the first time that a MAD or semi-MAD state can be sustained and jets powered by the BH spin can be produced even when the stream is much denser than the disk, i.e. in the first month(s) of a jetted TDE. We also demonstrate that the strength of the self-intersection shock decreases as $f_\rho$, and time, increases. The jet or funnel can become significantly tilted (by $10-30^\circ$) due to the self-intersection outflow when $f_\rho \leq 0.1$. In models with a powerful jet and $f_\rho\leq 0.01$, the tilted jet interacts with and ultimately tilts the disk by as much as 23 degrees from the incoming stream and this tilted state is stable for the duration of the simulation. As $f_\rho$ increases, the tilt of the jet and disk is expected to realign with the BH spin once $f_\rho \geq 0.1$. The jet tilt could rapidly realign due to outer disk collapse or the self-intersection radius increasing. Our results provide an alternative explanation for the observed X-ray jet shut-off in days-weeks in jetted TDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physics of turbulence in magnetized plasmas remains an unresolved problem. The most poorly understood aspect is intermittency -- spatio-temporal fluctuations superimposed on the self-similar turbulent motions. We employ a novel machine-learning analysis technique to segment turbulent flow structures into distinct clusters based on statistical similarities across multiple physical features. We apply this technique to kinetic simulations of decaying (freely evolving) and driven (forced) turbulence in a strongly magnetized pair-plasma environment, and find that the previously identified intermittent fluctuations consist of two distinct clusters: i) current sheets, thin slabs of electric current between merging flux ropes, and; ii) double sheets, pairs of oppositely polarized current slabs, possibly generated by two non-linearly interacting Alfv\'en-wave packets. The distinction is crucial for the construction of realistic turbulence sub-grid models.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing parametric gravitational-wave population fits from non-parametric results without refitting the data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining multiple events into population analyses is a cornerstone of gravitational-wave astronomy. A critical component of such studies is the assumed population model, which can range from astrophysically motivated functional forms to non-parametric treatments that are flexible but difficult to interpret. In practice, the current approach is to fit the data multiple times with different population models to identify robust features. We propose an alternative strategy: assuming the data have already been fit with a flexible model, we present a practical recipe to reconstruct the population distribution of a different model. As our procedure postprocesses existing results, it avoids the need to access the underlying gravitational-wave data again and handle selection effects. Additionally, our reconstruction metric provides a goodness-of-fit measure to compare multiple models. We apply this method to the mass distribution of black-hole binaries detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. Our work paves the way for streamlined gravitational-wave population analyses by fitting the data once and for all with advanced non-parametric methods and careful handling of selection effects, while the astrophysical interpretation is then made accessible using our reconstruction procedure on targeted models. The key principle is that of conceptually separating data description from data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Secondary spins of extreme mass ratio inspirals: A probe to the formation channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a secondary (stellar mass) black hole (BH) orbiting around a supermassive BH, are one of the primary targets for future spaceborne gravitational wave (GW) detectors. The spin of the secondary BH encodes the formation history of the stellar mass BH and the formation process of the EMRI. In this work, we construct a kludge EMRI waveform model taking the secondary spin into account and preliminarily forecast the measurement precision of the secondary spin by future spaceborne GW detectors with the Fisher information matrix. We find the secondary spin might be measured with reasonably good precision for generic eccentric and inclined EMRIs, with the caveat that the predictive precision may be constrained by the model's inherent simplifications. As an example of its astrophysical applications, we propose that the secondary spin can be used for distinguishing dry (loss cone) EMRIs (where the secondary BHs were born in the collapse of individual massive stars and are of low spin) and Hills EMRIs (where the secondary BHs are remnants of massive star binaries and the secondary spins follow a bimodal distribution).</description>

      <title>Location of a Sample of GeV and Optical Outbursts in the Jets of Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exact location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region in blazar jets has long been a matter of debate. However, the location has important implications about the emission processes, geometric and physical parameters of the jet, as well as the nature of interaction of the jet with the interstellar and intergalactic medium. Diverse conclusions have been drawn by various authors based on a variety of methods applied to different data sets of many blazars, e.g., the location is less than 0.1 pc from the central engine within the broad line region (BLR) or a few or tens of pc downstream beyond the dusty torus or at some intermediate distance. Here we use a method, established in a previous work, in which the location of the GeV/optical emission is determined using the ratio of energy dissipated during contemporaneous outbursts at those wave bands. We apply it to a total of 47 multi-wavelength outbursts in 10 blazars. We find that the location of the GeV/optical emission is beyond the BLR for all cases. This result is consistent with other studies, in which the location has been determined for a large sample of blazars. We compare the location determined by our method for several GeV outbursts of multiple blazars to that obtained by other authors using different methods. We find that our results are consistent in such one-to-one comparison in most cases, for which the required data were available.</description>

      <title>Novel inner shadows of the Kerr black hole with a tilted thin accretion disk</title>

Abstract: The inner shadow of a black hole, as a projection of the event horizon, is regarded as a potential tool for testing gravitational theories and constraining system parameters. Whether this holds in the case of a tilted accretion disk warrants further investigation. In this paper, we employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate images of the Kerr black hole illuminated by a tilted thin accretion disk, with particular attention to the relationship between the inner shadow and system parameters. Our findings reveal that in the case of an equatorial accretion disk, the Kerr black hole exhibits a minimum inner shadow size of $S_{\textrm{min}} = 13.075$ M$^{2}$, where M denotes the black hole mass. This minimum is achieved when the viewing angle is $0^{\circ}$ and the spin parameter approaches $1$. However, with a non-zero disk tilt, the inner shadow exhibits novel configurations -- taking on petal, crescent, or eyebrow shapes -- significantly smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ across various parameter spaces. This indicates that the inner shadow is highly sensitive to the accretion environment, suggesting that caution is needed when using it as a diagnostic tool for black holes. Notably, an observed inner shadow smaller than $S_{\textrm{min}}$ would either indicate the presence of a tilted accretion disk or support the viability of modified gravity. Moreover, in certain parameter spaces, we identify the emergence of a dual-shadow structure, which could also serve as a probe for the tilted accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Neural Network Surrogate Models: Application to Black Hole Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16462</link>

Abstract: Surrogate models of numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes provide the most accurate tools for gravitational-wave data analysis. Neural network-based surrogates promise evaluation speedups, but their accuracy relies on (often obscure) tuning of settings such as the network architecture, hyperparameters, and the size of the training dataset. We propose a systematic optimization strategy that formalizes setting choices and motivates the amount of training data required. We apply this strategy on NRSur7dq4Remnant, an existing surrogate model for the properties of the remnant of generically precessing binary black hole mergers and construct a neural network version, which we label NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN. The systematic optimization strategy results in a new surrogate model with comparable accuracy, and provides insights into the meaning and role of the various network settings and hyperparameters as well as the structure of the physical process. Moreover, NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN results in evaluation speedups of up to $8$ times on a single CPU and a further improvement of $2,000$ times when evaluated in batches on a GPU. To determine the training set size, we propose an iterative enrichment strategy that efficiently samples the parameter space using much smaller training sets than naive sampling. NRSur7dq4Remnant_NN requires $O(10^4)$ training data, so neural network-based surrogates are ideal for speeding-up models that support such large training datasets, but at the moment cannot directly be applied to numerical relativity catalogs that are $O(10^3)$ in size. The optimization strategy is available through the gwbonsai package.</description>

      <title>A weak Ly$\alpha$ halo for an extremely bright Little Red Dot. Indications of enshrouded SMBH growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09542</link>

Abstract: The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas ($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486 emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN, while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$, $\Delta r&lt;100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924 affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$ and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.</description>
