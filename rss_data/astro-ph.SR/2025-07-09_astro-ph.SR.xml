      <title>Solar Flare Prediction Using LSTM and DLSTM with Sliding Window Pattern Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</description>

      <title>Seismology and diffusion of ultramassive white dwarf magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs; defined by masses $\gtrsim 1.1\,{\rm M}_\odot$) are prime targets for seismology, because they pass through the ZZ Ceti instability strip at the same time that their cores crystallize. Recent studies suggest that crystallization may magnetize white dwarf interiors with a strong magnetic field $B_0$ up to a radius $r_{\rm out}^0$, either through a magnetic dynamo or by transporting a pre-existing fossil field. We demonstrate that seismology can probe these buried fields before they break out at the surface, because even the weak exponential tail of the outwardly diffusing field can disrupt the propagation of gravity waves near the surface. Based on the observed oscillation modes of WD J0135+5722 - the richest pulsating UMWD to date - we constrain its surface field $B_{\rm surf}\lesssim 2\,\textrm{kG}$. We solve the induction equation and translate this to an upper limit on the internal field $B_0$. For a carbon-oxygen (CO) core we find $B_{\rm surf}\ll B_0\lesssim 0.6\,\textrm{MG}$, consistent with the crystallization dynamo theory. For an oxygen-neon (ONe) core, on the the other hand, $r_{\rm out}^0$ is larger, such that the magnetic field breaks out and $B_{\rm surf}\lesssim B_0\lesssim 7\,\textrm{kG}$. This low magnetic field rules out an ONe composition or, alternatively, an intense dynamo during crystallization or merger. Either way, the imprint of magnetic fields on UMWD seismology may reveal the uncertain composition and formation paths of these stars.</description>

      <title>Nickel- and iron-rich clumps in planetary nebulae: New discoveries and emission-line diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) offers a distinct advantage for studying extended sources by enabling spatially resolved emission maps for several emission lines without the need for specific filters. This study conducts a detailed analysis of iron and nickel emission lines in 12 planetary nebulae (PNe) using integral field unit (IFU) data from MUSE to provide insights into their formation and evolution mechanisms. New diagnostic line ratios, combined with machine-learning algorithms, were used to distinguish excitation mechanisms such as shock and photoionization. Electron densities and elemental abundances were estimated using different atomic data through the PyNeb package. The contribution of fluorescent excitation of nickel lines was also examined. A total of 16 iron- and nickel-rich clumps are detected in seven out of 12 PNe. New clumps are discovered in NGC 3132 and IC 4406. The most prominent lines are [Fe II] 8617 Angstrom and [Ni II] 7378 Angstrom. Both emission lines are observed emanating directly from the low-ionization structures (LIS) of NGC 3242, NGC 7009, and NGC 6153, as well as from clumps in NGC 6369 and Tc 1. Their abundances are found to be below solar values, indicating that a fraction of Fe and Ni remains depleted in dust grains. The depletion factors exhibit a strong correlation over a wide range. A machine-learning approach allows us to classify ten out of 16 clumps as shock-excited and to establish a new shock/photoionization selection criterion: log([Ni II] 7378 Angstrom / H-alpha) and log([Fe II] 8617 Angstrom / H-alpha) greater than -2.20.</description>

      <title>Probing Binary Architectures of Lithium-Rich Giants in GALAH with COSMIC and Stellar Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface lithium is depleted when a star goes through the first dredge-up phase, yet $1\%$ of red giants are found to be Li-rich. The formation mechanism for these remains uncertain. We combine observational constraints from GALAH Li-rich giants, with the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to investigate system properties of these objects assuming binary mass transfer. By evolving 9 million binary systems, we find that binary histories most consistent with observational constraints are mass transfer from an intermediate-mass AGB donor to a main-sequence star now observed as a Li-rich red giant. In GALAH, $9\%$ of main-sequence stars have $\rm A(Li)=2.5-3.2$ dex making it plausible to create red giants with $\rm A(Li)=1.5-2.2 \; dex$ via main-sequence mass transfer, but cannot explain the more enriched giants $\rm A(Li) \gtrsim 2.2 \; dex$. Nucleosynthetic yields from stellar models show that AGB stars with initial masses of $4.25-5 \; \rm M_\odot$ and $8 \; \rm M_\odot$ contain the most Li in their ejecta. Intermediate-mass AGB stars comprise $29\%$ of COSMIC results, with present-day separations $s=3.3\pm0.5 \rm \; AU$ and mass ratios $q=0.5-1.6$. We achieve $95\%$ agreement in mean enhancements in $\rm (Ba, Y)$ between GALAH observations and stellar models of 6 and $8 \rm \; M_\odot$ AGB, assuming $1\%$ mass transfer efficiency. We find a low mass transfer efficiency best reproduces GALAH observations suggesting that the preferred mass transfer mechanism for Li-enrichment is via wind Roche Lobe Overflow. While we constrain the most plausible binary parameters assuming AGB mass transfer creates Li-rich giants, discrepancies in nucleosynthesis comparisons, and the small fraction of Li-enhanced main-sequence stars suggests additional enrichment mechanisms are likely.</description>

      <title>An optical to infrared study of type II SN2024ggi at nebular times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements (O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at &lt;~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of 56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star explosions.</description>

      <title>Survey of Surveys. II. Stellar parameters for 23 millions of stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current panorama of large surveys, the vast amount of data obtained with different methods, data types, formats, and stellar samples, is making an efficient use of the available information difficult. The Survey of Surveys is a project to critically compile survey results in a single catalogue, facilitating the scientific use of the available information. In this second release, we present two new catalogs of stellar parameters (Teff, logg, and [Fe/H]). To build the first catalog, SoS-Spectro, we calibrated internally and externally stellar parameters from five spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, GALAH, Gaia-ESO, RAVE, and LAMOST) and externally on the PASTEL database. The second catalog, SoS-ML catalog, is obtained by using SoS-Spectro as a reference to train a multi-layer perceptron, which predicts stellar parameters based on two photometric surveys, SDSS and SkyMapper. As a novel approach, we build on previous parameters sets, from Gaia DR3 and Andrae et al. (2023), aiming to improve their precision and accuracy. We obtain a catalog of stellar parameters for around 23 millions of stars, which we make publicly available. We validate our results with several comparisons with other machine learning catalogs, stellar clusters, and astroseismic samples. We find substantial improvements in the parameters estimates compared to other Machine Learning methods in terms of precision and accuracy, especially in the metal-poor range, as shown in particular when validating our results with globular clusters. We believe that there are two reasons behind our improved results at the low-metallicity end: first, our use of a reference catalog, the SoS-Spectro, which is calibrated using high-resolution spectroscopic data; and second, our choice to build on pre-existing parameter estimates from em Gaia and Andrae et al., rather than attempting to obtain our predictions from survey data alone.</description>

      <title>Magnetic White Dwarfs in the SDSS 100 pc Sample: Further Evidence of Two Formation Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a model atmosphere analysis on all magnetic white dwarfs in the SDSS 100 pc sample. We have 163 magnetic targets in this sample, 87 of which are new discoveries, making this the largest volume-limited survey of magnetic white dwarfs to date. We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters, including mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two populations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms based on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects typically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old, average mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a crystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing young and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically significant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic targets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations lie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling ages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8 Gyr, 0.96 $M_{\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual formation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of magnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization. However, given the breakout times required for a crystallization dynamo, we find that many of our older, average mass objects can be better explained with a core-convective dynamo that forms on the main-sequence.</description>

      <title>Causal Foundation Models: Disentangling Physics from Instrument Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments. This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning. Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation learning for structured data.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the ZTF SLRN-2020 star-planet merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the optical and infrared transient ZTF SLRN-2020, previously associated with a star-planet merger. We consider the scenario in which orbital decay via tidal dissipation led to the merger, and find that tidal heating within the star was likely unobservable in the archival image of the system taken $12\mathrm{yr}$ before the merger. The observed dust formation months before the merger is consistent with a planet of mass $M_\mathrm{p} \gtrsim 5M_\mathrm{J}$ ejecting material as it skims the stellar surface. This interaction gradually intensifies, leading to significant mass ejection on a dynamical timescale ($ \approx $ hours) as the planet plunges into the stellar interior. Part of the recombination transient associated with this dynamical mass ejection might be inaccessible to the optical observations because its duration ($ \approx $ hours) is comparable to the cadence. Correspondingly, the observed duration of the transient $\approx100\mathrm{d}$ is inconsistent with a single episode of dynamical mass ejection. Instead, the transient could be powered by the recombination of $ \approx 3.4\times10^{-5}M_\odot $ of hydrogen in an outflow, or the contraction of an inflated envelope of mass $ \approx 10^{-6}M_\odot $ that formed during the merger. The observed ejecta mass $320\mathrm{d}$ after the peak of the optical transient is $ \approx 1.3\times10^{-4}M_\odot$, consistent with the idea that a fraction of the ejecta might be unobservable in the light curve. Energetically, this post-merger ejecta mass suggests a planet at least as massive as Jupiter. Our results suggest that ZTF SLRN-2020 was the result of a merger between a star close to the main sequence and a planet with mass at least several times that of Jupiter.</description>

      <title>ASASSN-24fw: Candidate circumplanetary disk occultation of a main-sequence star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dusty disks around planets in outer reaches of exo-planetary systems can be detected as long-lasting occultations, provided the observer is close to the planet's orbital plane. Here we report follow-up observations of ASASSN-24fw (Gaia 07:05:18.97+06:12:19.4), a 4-magnitude dimming event of a main-sequence star which lasted 8.5 months. Using optical spectroscopy with KOSMOS (APO), MagE (Magellan) and GHOST (Gemini-S), we find strong Na I D absorption indicating that the occulter is gas rich. We detect multiple low-ionization metal emission lines with velocity dispersion &lt;10 km/s blue-shifted by 27 km/sk with respect to the system, which likely originate in the occulter, as well as blue-shifted and broad (200 km/s) Halpha line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. Assuming that the occulter is a circumplanetary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we derive the planet's mass of 0.5-19 MJupiter and a circumplanetary disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star (&gt;2 Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and is more likely to be a result of a planetary collision. If Na D absorption and metal emission lines originate in the circumplanetary disk, the observations presented here are the first discovery of a planet-driven wind or of circumsecondary disk rotation.</description>

      <title>Modelling the 3D atmospheric structure of the cold Jupiter WD1856+534b orbiting a white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: WD-1856b+534b (WD-1856b) is to date the only detected cold Jupiter outside of our Solar System. This cold Jupiter can provide useful information about the cold giants in our Solar System. Recent JWST observations have targeted WD-1856b, with more scheduled in the near future. To support the interpretation of these observations, we simulated WD-1856b using a three-dimensional (3D) General Circulation Model (GCM) and produced synthetic emission spectra of the planet. We used the Exo-FMS GCM with correlated-k radiative transfer (RT) and mixing-length theory (MLT). In addition, we included abundances of 13 chemical species using the thermochemical kinetic model mini-chem. Because there are substantial uncertainties in the metallicity and internal temperature of WD-1856b, we ran simulations with 1x, 10x, and 100x solar compositions and at low and high internal temperatures (100 K and 500 K). We generated emission spectra and brightness temperature curves with the GCM output using the 3D Monte Carlo radiative-transfer code gCMCRT. Our results suggest larger volume mixing ratios (VMR) of CO and \CO2 with a warmer core at higher metallicity. With a colder core, H2O and CH4 become more relevant and increase to 0.01 VMR at 100x Solar. We suggest possible \H2O cloud formation in the upper atmosphere in the warm 100x solar case and in all cold cases, which may reduce gas phase H2O in the upper atmosphere moderately.</description>

      <title>Type Ibn supernovae from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors</title>

Abstract: Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.</description>

      <title>Counting mass with Gaia: Mass Density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} = 0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} = 0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.</description>

      <title>Photodesorption of SO2 and SO from UV-irradiated SO2 ices</title>

Abstract: The detection of high gas-phase abundances of SO2 and SO in the cold envelope of an intermediate mass protostar suggests that these molecules might form on icy dust grains and subsequently desorb to the gas phase by non-thermal desorption processes such as photodesorption. In this work we report photodesorption yields for SO2 and, tentatively, SO upon ultraviolet photon irradiation of SO2 ice samples at temperatures between 14 and 80 K. Photodesorption yields were measured directly in the gas phase using a calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer. Yields of 2.3 x 10-4 molecule/photon and 6 x 10-5 molecule/photon were estimated for SO2 and SO at 14 K (respectively). The SO2 photodesorption yield increased with temperature up to a value of 3.8 x 10-4 molecule/photon at 70 K, followed by a decrease at 80 K that could be due to crystallization of the sample. The signal assigned to SO photodesorption did not significantly change with temperature. The estimated photodesorption yields were included in the Nautilus gas-grain chemical model to evaluate their contribution to the SO2 and SO gas-phase abundances in an astrophysical environment. In addition, we also present a theoretically estimated band strength for the 1395 cm-1 SO3 IR feature (A = 1.1 x 10-16 cm molecule-1). SO3 is the main detected product in irradiated SO2 ices, and a potential contributor to the 7.2 um band observed in some interstellar ice IR spectra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from the SNAD VIII Workshop, during which we conducted the first systematic anomaly search in the ZTF fields also observed by LSSTComCam during Rubin Scientific Pipeline commissioning. Using the PineForest active anomaly detection algorithm, we analysed four selected fields (two galactic and two extragalactic) and visually inspected 400 candidates. As a result, we discovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY Draconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications and periods for six known objects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline and provide a preview of the discovery potential in the upcoming LSST data.</description>

      <title>Brown dwarf number density in the JWST COSMOS-Web field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are failed stars with very low mass (13 to 75 $M_J$), and an effective temperature lower than 2500 K. Thus, they play a key role in understanding the gap in the mass function between stars and planets. However, due to their faint nature, previous searches are inevitably limited to the solar neighbourhood (20 pc). To improve our knowledge of the low mass part of the initial stellar mass function and the star formation history of the Milky Way, it is crucial to find more distant brown dwarfs. Using James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) COSMOS-Web data, this study seeks to enhance our comprehension of the physical characteristics of brown dwarfs situated at a distance of kpc scale. The exceptional sensitivity of the JWST enables the detection of brown dwarfs that are up to 100 times more distant than those discovered in the earlier all-sky infrared surveys. The large area coverage of the JWST COSMOS-Web survey allows us to find more distant brown dwarfs than earlier JWST studies with smaller area coverages. To capture prominent water absorption features around 2.7 $\mu$m, we apply two colour criteria, F115W-F277W+1&lt;F277W-F444W and F277W-F444W&gt;0.9. We then select point sources by CLASS_STAR, FLUX_RADIUS, and SPREAD_MODEL criteria. Faint sources are visually checked to exclude possibly extended sources. We conduct SED fitting and MCMC simulations to determine their physical properties and associated uncertainties. Our search reveals 25 T-dwarf and 2 Y-dwarf candidates, more than any previous JWST brown dwarf searches. They are located from 0.3 kpc to 4 kpc away from the Earth. The cumulative number count of our brown dwarf candidates is consistent with the prediction from a standard double exponential model. Three of our brown dwarf candidates were detected by HST, with transverse velocities $12\pm5$ km s$^{-1}$, $12\pm4$ km s$^{-1}$, and $17\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Star formation and accretion rates within 500 pc as traced by Gaia DR3 XP spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc. We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$ pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of 2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is 70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Magnetic dynamos powered by white dwarf superficial convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the effective temperature of a cooling white dwarf $T_{\rm eff}$ drops below the ionization limit, it develops a surface convection zone that may generate a magnetic field $B$ through one of several dynamo mechanisms. We revisit this possibility systematically using detailed stellar evolution computations, as well as a simple analytical model that tracks the expansion of the convection zone. The magnetic field reaches a maximum of several kG (for a hydrogen atmosphere) shortly after a convection zone is established at a cooling time $t=t_{\rm conv}$. The field then declines as $B\propto T_{\rm eff}\propto t^{-7/20}$ until the convective envelope couples to the degenerate core at $t=t_{\rm coup}$. We compare the onset of convection $t_{\rm conv}\propto M^{25/21}$ to the crystallization of the white dwarf's core $t_{\rm cryst}\propto M^{-5/3}$, and find that in the mass range $0.5\,{\rm M}_\odot&lt;M&lt;0.9\,{\rm M}_\odot$ the order of events is $t_{\rm conv}&lt;t_{\rm cryst}&lt;t_{\rm coup}$. Specifically, surface dynamos are active for a period $\Delta t\approx t_{\rm cryst}-t_{\rm conv}$ of about a Gyr (shorter for higher masses), before the convection zone is overrun by a stronger magnetic field emanating from the crystallizing core. Our predicted magnetic fields are at the current detection limit, and we do not find any observed candidates that fit the theory. None the less, surface dynamos may be an inevitable outcome of white dwarf cooling, significantly affecting white dwarf accretion and seismology.</description>

      <title>On the source sizes of type II radio bursts with LOFAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar radio bursts can provide important insights into the underlying physical mechanisms that drive the small and large-scale eruptions on the Sun. Since metric radio observations can give us direct observational access to the inner and middle corona, they are often used as an important tool to monitor and understand the coronal dynamics. While the sizes of the radio sources that can be observed in the solar corona is essential for understanding the nature of density turbulence within the solar corona and its subsequent influence on the angular broadening observed in radio source measurements, the smallest radio sources associated with solar radio bursts have so far been limited by observational techniques and the radio instrument's baselines. We selected three type II bursts that were observed with the LOFAR core and remote stations in the Solar Cycle 24. We estimated the sizes and shapes (ellipticity) of the radio sources between $20-200$ MHz using a two-dimensional Gaussian approximation. Our analysis shows that the smallest radio source size for type II bursts in the solar corona which can be observed in the solar atmosphere at low frequencies is $1.5^\prime \pm 0.5^\prime$ at 150 MHz. However, even though the observations were taken with remote baselines (with a maximum distance of $\sim 85~km$), the effective baselines were much shorter ($\sim 35~km$) likely due to snapshot imaging of the Sun. Our results show that the radio source sizes are less affected by scattering than suggested in previous studies. Our measurements indicate a smaller source sizes at frequencies below 95 MHz compared to previous reports, though some overlap exists with measurements at higher frequencies, using smaller baselines.</description>

      <title>Dark Kinetic Heating of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark kinetic heating of neutron stars has been previously studied as a promising dark matter detection avenue. Kinetic heating occurs when dark matter is sped up to relativistic speeds in the gravitational well of high-escape velocity objects, and deposits kinetic energy after becoming captured by the object, thereby increasing its temperature. We show that dark kinetic heating can be significant even in objects with low-escape velocities, such as exoplanets and brown dwarfs, increasing the discovery potential of such searches. This can occur if there is a long-range dark force, creating a "dark escape velocity", leading to heating rates substantially larger than those expected from neutron stars. We consequently set constraints on dark sector parameters using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and JWST data on Super-Jupiter WISE 0855-0714, and map out future sensitivity to the dark matter scattering cross section below $10^{-40}~{\rm cm}^2$. We compare dark kinetic heating rates of other lower escape velocity objects such as the Earth, Sun, and white dwarfs, finding complementary kinetic heating signals are possible depending on particle physics parameters.</description>

      <title>Gravity or turbulence? VII. The Schmidt-Kennicutt law, the star formation efficiency, and the mass density of clusters from gravitational collapse rather than turbulent support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) relations and the star formation efficiency per free-fall time ($\epsilon_{\rm ff}$), mirroring observational studies, in numerical simulations of filamentary molecular clouds undergoing gravitational contraction. We find that (a)~collapsing clouds accurately replicate the observed SK relations for galactic clouds and (b)~$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ is small and constant in space and in time, with values similar to those found in local clouds. We propose that this constancy arises from the similar radial scaling of the free-fall time ($\tau_{\rm ff}$) and the internal mass in density structures with spherically-averaged density profiles near $r^{-2}$. We additionally show that (c)~the star formation rate (SFR) increases rapidly in time; (d)~the low values of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ result from evaluating $\tau_{\rm ff}$ and the characteristic star-formation time scale over different time intervals, combined with the increasing SFR, and (e)~the fact that star clusters are significantly denser than the gas clumps from which they form is a natural consequence of the rapidly increasing SFR, the continuous replenishment of the star-forming gas by the accretion flow, and the near $r^{-2}$ density profile induced by the collapse. Finally, we argue that interpreting $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ as an efficiency is problematic since it is not bounded by unity, and because the gas mass in clouds evolves. Instead, we propose that viewing $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ as the ratio of the actual SFR to the gas free-fall rate. In summary, our results show that the SK relation, the low values of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and the mass density of stellar clusters arise naturally from gravitational contraction.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Born-Infeld boson compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study gravitationally bound compact objects sourced by a string theory inspired Born-Infeld scalar field. Unlike many of their canonical scalar field counterparts, these ``boson stars'' do not have to extend out to infinity and may generate compact bodies. We analyze in detail both the junction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the center which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the object and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although involved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that these compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars and some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are several branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are realized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions tend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes, and also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface compactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made arbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some comments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable and unstable regimes. However, we argue that even in the possibly stable regime the event horizon in the vacuum region shielding the object is potentially unstable, and would cut off the star from the rest of the universe.</description>

Abstract: We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of CO in a warm bubble around accreting protoplanets and its observability</title>

Abstract: The cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks are expected to contain a midplane-centered layer where gas-phase CO molecules freeze out and their overall abundance is low. The layer then manifests itself as a void in the channel maps of CO rotational emission lines. We explore whether the frozen-out layer can expose the circumplanetary environment of embedded accreting protoplanets to observations. To this end, we performed 3D radiative gas-dust hydrodynamic simulations with opacities determined by the redistribution of submicron- and millimeter-sized dust grains. A Jupiter-mass planet with an accretion luminosity of $\sim$$10^{-3}\,L_{\odot}$ was considered as the nominal case. The accretion heating sustains a warm bubble around the planet, which locally increases the abundance of gas-phase CO molecules. Radiative transfer predictions of the emergent sky images show that the bubble becomes a conspicuous CO emission source in channel maps. It appears as a low-intensity optically thick spot located in between the so-called dragonfly wings that trace the fore- and backside line-forming surfaces. The emission intensity of the bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopolog, suggesting a very rich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the extended disk emission. This can be achieved with isotopologs that are optically thin or weakly thermally stratified across the planet-induced gap, such as C$^{18}$O. For these, the bubble stands out as the brightest residual in synthetic ALMA observations after subtraction of axially averaged channel maps inferred from the disk kinematics, enabling new automatic detections of forming protoplanets. By contrast, the horseshoe flow steadily depletes large dust grains from the circumplanetary environment, which becomes unobservable in the submillimeter continuum, in accordance with the scarcity of ALMA detections.</description>
