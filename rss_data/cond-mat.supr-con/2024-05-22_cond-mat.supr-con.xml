      <title>Magnetic superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper serves as a primer on superconductivity, inviting students for further investigation. Although the theory of superconductivity is a many-body quantum theory, here we take a more didactic route based on thermodynamics and symmetry. We briefly survey the more than a century-old field and provide a one-sentence definition of a superconductor. Surprisingly, many textbooks lack such a definition, usually introducing superconductors through their properties rather than by definition. We explain the concept of an order parameter, symmetry, and symmetry breaking. Based on this, we clarify the difference between conventional and unconventional superconductors, which is frequently a confusing topic for newcomers. We provide the reader with a taste of a current research topic in the field of unconventional superconductivity and magnetism. For this, we explain the concept of time-reversal symmetry breaking in condensed matter physics, which is usually associated with a form of magnetism. Here, we show that time-reversal symmetry might be broken in superconductors, leading to magnetic properties due to superconductivity itself. For this purpose, we utilize the method of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for phase transitions. We discuss the field of chiral superconductivity and guide the interested reader to further study.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic growth of tantalum thin films for low-loss superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advancements highlighting Ta as a promising material in low-loss superconducting circuits and showing long coherence times in superconducting qubits, we have explored the effect of cryogenic temperatures on the growth of Ta and its integration in superconducting circuits. Cryogenic growth of Ta using a low temperature molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system is found to stabilize single phase $\alpha$-Ta on several different substrates, which include Al$\mathrm{_2}$O$\mathrm{_3}$(0001), Si(001), Si(111), SiN${_x}$, and GaAs(001). The substrates are actively cooled down to cryogenic temperatures and remain &lt; 20 K during the Ta deposition. X-ray $\theta$-2$\theta$ diffraction after warming to room temperature indicates the formation of polycrystalline $\alpha$-Ta. The 50 nm $\alpha$-Ta films grown on Al$\mathrm{_2}$O$\mathrm{_3}$(0001) at a substrate manipulator temperature of 7 K have a room temperature resistivity ($\mathrm{\rho _{300 K}}$) of 13.4 $\mathrm{\mu \Omega}$cm, a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 17.3 and a superconducting transition temperature (T$_C$) of 4.14 K, which are comparable to bulk values. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicates that the film grown at 7 K with an RMS roughness of 0.45 nm was significantly smoother than the one grown at room temperature. Similar properties are found for films grown on other substrates. Results for films grown at higher substrate manipulator temperatures show higher $\mathrm{\rho _{300 K}}$, lower RRR and Tc, and increased $\beta$-Ta content. Coplanar waveguide resonators with a gap width of 3 $\mathrm{\mu}$m fabricated from cryogenically grown Ta on Si(111) and Al$\mathrm{_2}$O$\mathrm{_3}$(0001) show low power Q$_i$ of 1.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively, indicating polycrystalline $\alpha$-Ta films may be promising for superconducting qubit applications even though they are not fully epitaxial.</description>

      <title>The transition-metal-dichalcogenide family as a superconductor tuned by charge density wave strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), consisting of H-NbSe$_2$, H-NbS$_2$, H-TaSe$_2$ and H-TaS$_2$, remain superconducting down to a thickness of a single layer. In these materials, thickness affects a variety of properties, including Ising protection, two-band superconductivity, and the critical temperature $T_C$, which decreases for the Nb-based, and increases for the Ta-based materials. This contradicting trend is puzzling, and has precluded the development of a unified theory. We approach the question of thickness-evolution of $T_C$ and the superconducting gap $\Delta$ by measuring high-resolution tunneling spectra in TaS$_2$-based stacked devices. Our measurements allow for simultaneous evaluation of $\Delta$, $T_C$, and the upper critical field $H_{C2}$. The latter, we find, is strongly enhanced towards the single-layer limit, following a $H_{C2} \propto \Delta^2$ proportionality ratio. Our main finding is that the same ratio holds for the entire family of metallic TMDs: TaS$_2$ and NbSe$_2$ of all thicknesses, bulk TaSe$_2$ and bulk NbS$_2$, extending over 4 orders of magnitude in $H_{C2}$ and covering both clean and dirty limits. We propose that this tunability across the TMD family is controlled by the competing charge density wave (CDW) phase. Using Gor'kov's theory, we calculate how a CDW order affects the quasiparticle density of states and the resulting $T_C$ and $H_{C2}$. Our results suggest that CDW is the key determinant factor limiting $T_C$ in the TMD family. They also show that $H_{C2}$ is universally enhanced by a factor of two orders of magnitude above the expected value, an effect that remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in 2D systems enhanced by nonadiabatic phonon-production effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical effects of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) on the superconducting properties of two-dimensional (2D) systems, calculating the Eliashberg function in terms of dynamically renormalized phonons. By studying different approximations for the phonon self-energy, we identify the important role of charge fluctuations in shaping the superconductivity properties, not only through the renormalization of phonon frequencies and damping rates but also through structural changes in the phonon spectral function. With the dynamical effects treated consistently, we argue that a part of the phonon spectral weight necessarily shifts to low frequencies due to the coupling to the 2D gapless plasmon. Furthermore, we find that the EPC leads to excess phonon spectral weight as well - i.e., phonon production - which generally tends to enhance the transition temperature. Our calculations point out that the influence of phonon production becomes greater as the density and the effective mass of electrons increase.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition in polycrystalline YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ samples during the oxidation process at constant temperature via thermogravimetry and differential thermometry analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the oxygenation process of polycrystalline powder of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+\delta}$ superconductor material through constant temperature thermogravimetric analysis. Starting from completely deoxygenated samples ($\delta$ = 0), both the mass evolution in an oxygen atmosphere and a differential temperature value referenced to an inert sample (alumina powder) subjected to the same experimental conditions are recorded. The oxygenation process itself is identified as an exothermic process accompanied by a second also exothermic associated process. This second process is identified as the Tetragonal-Orthorhombic transition present in the material. Based on the obtained results, the structural phase diagram of the material is reconstructed. Issues of metastability of the structural phases, as well as the potential of the equipment used to obtain these results comparable to those obtained in large facilities, are discussed. Reinterpretations of previously discussed works in the literature are inferred.</description>

      <title>Predictive design of two-dimensional electrides with tunable magnetic, topological, and superconducting properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials are of interest for their exotic properties, for example, superconductivity, and highly tunability. Focusing on phonon-mediating superconductivity, one would propose to promote critical temperature by substituting heavy elements by lighter ones, in order to increase Debye temperature. Following recent experimental progress in transition-metal nitrides and theoretically revealing W$_2$N$_3$ as a candidate for high-temperature superconductivity, we investigate the possibility of two-dimensional superconductivity through surface engineering on MoN$_2$. Using density functional theory calculation, we found multigap superconductivity at temperature up to 36K within anisotropic Eliashberg equation in passivated electride-like surfaces. We also demonstrate their possibility to sustain topological superconductivity with strong spin-orbital coupling.</description>

      <title>The Kohn-Luttinger Effect in Dense Matter and its Implications for Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Repulsive short-range interactions can induce p-wave attraction between fermions in dense matter and lead to Cooper pairing at the Fermi surface. We investigate this phenomenon, well-known as the Kohn-Luttinger effect in condensed matter physics, in dense matter with strong short-range repulsive interactions. We find that repulsive interactions required to stabilize massive neutron stars can induce p-wave pairing in neutron and quark matter. When massive vector bosons mediate the interaction between fermions, the induced interaction favors Cooper pairing in the 3P2 channel. For the typical strength of the interaction favored by massive neutron stars, the associated pairing gaps in neutrons can be in the range of 10 keV to 10 MeV. Strong and attractive spin-orbit and tensor forces between neutrons can result in repulsive induced interactions that greatly suppress the 3P2 pairing gap in neutron matter. In quark matter, the induced interaction is too small to result in pairing gaps of phenomenological relevance.</description>

      <title>Spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material.In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be quenched to the zero-resistance state by applying a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process with a fixed sweeping direction. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. Moreover, the angle-dependent in-plane critical field measurements reveal a two-fold symmetry that deviates from the original, centrosymmetric D$_{6h}$ point group symmetry of the crystal. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement theory of the heat capacity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory and mechanistic understanding of the thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently missing. We develop a theoretical quantum confinement description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for the heat capacity. In particular, due to the suppression of vibrational modes caused by the thin film confinement, the vibrational density of states (VDOS) deviates from the Debye quadratic law in frequency and is, instead, cubic in frequency. This leads to a temperature dependence of the heat capacity which is $\sim T^4$ instead of Debye's $\sim T^3$ law. Furthermore, the new theory predicts a linear increase of the heat capacity upon increasing the nanometric film thickness. Both dependencies are found in excellent agreement with recent experimental data on NbTiN thin films.</description>

      <title>Circuit QED theory of direct and dual Shapiro steps with finite-size transmission line resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of direct and dual Shapiro steps for a Josephson junction coupled to a finite-size transmission line resonator. We treat both problems through a circuit QED approach with a large, but finite number of photon modes. For the dual case, we do not assume the (approximate) charge-phase duality, but include the full multi-band dynamics for the Josephson junction. Mean-field equations within such Hamiltonian approach reproduce the result obtained through a dissipative classical equation when the number of transmission line modes is large enough. To account for quantum and thermal fluctuations, we go beyond the mean-field treatment within a truncated Wigner approach. The fluctuations are shown to modify both the direct and the dual steps. We show how the dual steps are very sensitive to these fluctuations and identify the key physical parameters for the junction and the transmission line controlling their robustness, which is essential for applications to close the quantum metrological triangle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson diode effect in topological Josephson junctions. By both analytic and numerical calculations, we find that while a Josephson junction in the topological phase may exhibit higher diode efficiency compared to that in the trivial phase, this behavior is not universal. The presence of Majorana bound states is not a sufficient condition for a large diode effect. Furthermore, the diode efficiency undergoes substantial changes only in specific regions along the topological phase transition boundary, and a significant diode effect does coincide with the topological phases. Thereby our paper suggests the utilization of topological superconductivity for enhanced JDE, and also the Josephson diode effect may serve as an indicator for topological superconductor phase. These results suggest a nuanced relationship between the topological aspects of Josephson junctions and Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A growing number of superconducting materials display evidence for spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) below their critical transition temperatures. Precisely what this implies for the nature of the superconducting ground state of such materials, however, is often not straightforward to infer. We review the experimental status and survey different theoretical mechanisms for the generation of TRSB in superconductors. In cases where a TRSB complex combination of two superconducting order parameter components is realized, defects, dislocations and sample edges may generate superflow patterns that can be picked up by magnetic probes. However, even single-component condensates that do not break time-reversal symmetry in their pure bulk phases can also support signatures of magnetism inside the superconducting state. This includes, for example, the generation of localized orbital current patterns or spin-polarization near atomic-scale impurities, twin boundaries and other defects. Signals of TRSB may also arise from a superconductivity-enhanced Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida exchange coupling between magnetic impurity moments present in the normal state. We discuss the relevance of these different mechanisms for TRSB in light of recent experiments on superconducting materials of current interest.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Doppler shifts in $d$-wave superconductor tunneling junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy levels of quasiparticles in superconductors experience Doppler shifts due to the influence of a finite current flow. The influence of the Doppler shift is particularly pronounced in unconventional superconductors with gap nodes. In the case of a normal/insulator/superconductor junction of $d$-wave superconductors, a zero-bias conductance peak exhibits a peak shift in an applied magnetic field. Although the shifts have been detected in experiments, the shifts showed different field responses depending on each experiment. In this paper, we evaluate the magnitude of the shift based on realistic junction shapes to elucidate the origin of the variability in experimental Doppler shifts. We find that the peak shift depends on the junction shape; the splitting is significantly suppressed when the junction is formed at a protruding position. Also, the shift is suppressed by the penetration of magnetic flux quanta, resulting in a nonlinear response to the magnetic field. The present results explain the origin of the variability in experimental Doppler shifts.</description>

Abstract: The one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is central to band topology in condensed matter physics, which allows us to understand and design distinct topological states. In this work, we find another mechanism to analogize the SSH model in a spinful system, realizing an obstructed atomic insulator by introducing intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and in-plane Zeeman field. In our model, the midgap states originate from a quantized hidden polarization with invariant index $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) due to the local inversion symmetry breaking. When the global inversion symmetry is broken, a charge pumping is designed by tuning the polarization. Moreover, by introducing the $p+ip$ superconductor pairing potential, a new topological phase dubbed obstructed superconductor (OSC) is identified. This new state is characterized by invariant index $\mathbb{Z}_2$ (0; 01) and nonchiral midgap states. More interestingly, these nonchiral edge states result in a chiral-like nonlocal conductance, which is different from the traditional chiral topological superconductor. Our findings not only find another strategy to achieve a spinful SSH model but also predict the existence of OSC, providing a promising avenue for further exploration of its transport properties.</description>
