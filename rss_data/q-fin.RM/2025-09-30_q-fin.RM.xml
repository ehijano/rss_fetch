      <title>Forecasting Liquidity Withdraw with Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquidity withdrawal is a critical indicator of market fragility. In this project, I test a framework for forecasting liquidity withdrawal at the individual-stock level, ranging from less liquid stocks to highly liquid large-cap tickers, and evaluate the relative performance of competing model classes in predicting short-horizon order book stress. We introduce the Liquidity Withdrawal Index (LWI) -- defined as the ratio of order cancellations to the sum of standing depth and new additions at the best quotes -- as a bounded, interpretable measure of transient liquidity removal.
  Using Nasdaq market-by-order (MBO) data, we compare a spectrum of approaches: linear benchmarks (AR, HAR), and non-linear tree ensembles (XGBoost), across horizons ranging from 250\,ms to 5\,s. Beyond predictive accuracy, our results provide insights into order placement and cancellation dynamics, identify regimes where linear versus non-linear signals dominate, and highlight how early-warning indicators of liquidity withdrawal can inform both market surveillance and execution.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Analysis Based on Markowitz Stochastic Dominance Criteria: A Behavioral Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops stochastic optimization problems for describing and analyzing behavioral investors with Markowitz Stochastic Dominance (MSD) preferences. Specifically, we establish dominance conditions in a discrete state-space to capture all reverse S-shaped MSD preferences as well as all subjective decision weights generated by inverse S-shaped probability weighting functions. We demonstrate that these dominance conditions can be admitted as linear constraints into the stochastic optimization problems to formulate computationally tractable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) models. We then employ the developed MILP models in financial portfolio analysis and examine classic behavioral factors such as reference point and subjective probability distortion in behavioral investors' portfolio decisions.</description>

      <title>Conditional Risk Minimization with Side Information: A Tractable, Universal Optimal Transport Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional risk minimization arises in high-stakes decisions where risk must be assessed in light of side information, such as stressed economic conditions, specific customer profiles, or other contextual covariates. Constructing reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult, motivating a series of optimal-transport-based proposals that address this uncertainty in a distributionally robust manner. Yet these approaches remain fragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point estimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow classes of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We introduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk minimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport. This framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming existing methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links; tractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk functionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting cutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems. Applications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility highlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models converging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Portfolio Risk: Forecasting Volatility Through Cointegrated Asset Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Historical and Dynamic Volatility Ratios (HVR/DVR) and show that equity and index volatilities are cointegrated at intraday and daily horizons. This allows us to construct a VECM to forecast portfolio volatility by exploiting volatility cointegration. On S&amp;P 500 data, HVR is generally stationary and cointegration with the index is frequent; the VECM implementation yields substantially lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than covariance-based forecasts at short- to medium-term horizons across portfolio sizes. The approach is interpretable and readily implementable, factorizing covariance into market volatility, relative-volatility ratios, and correlations.</description>

      <title>When risk defies order: On the limits of fractional stochastic dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on monotone additive statistics and questions regarding optimal risk sharing for return-based risk measures, we investigate the existence, structure, and applications of Meyer risk measures. Those are monetary risk measures consistent with fractional stochastic orders suggested by Meyer (1977a,b) as refinement of second-order stochastic dominance (SSD). These so-called $v$-SD orders are based on a threshold utility function $v$. The test utilities defining the associated order are those at least as risk averse in absolute terms as $v$. The generality of $v$ allows to subsume SSD and other examples from the literature. The structure of risk measures respecting the $v$-SD order is clarified by two types of representations. The existence of nontrivial examples is more subtle: for many choices of $v$ outside the exponential (CARA) class, they do not exist. Additional properties like convexity or positive homogeneity further restrict admissible examples, even within the CARA class. We present impossibility theorems that demonstrate a deeper link between the axiomatic structure of monetary risk measures and SSD than previously acknowledged. The study concludes with two applications: portfolio optimisation under a Meyer risk measure as objective, and risk assessment of financial time series data.</description>

      <title>On a risk model with tree-structured Poisson Markov random field frequency, with application to rainfall events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many insurance contexts, dependence between risks of a portfolio may arise from their frequencies. We investigate a dependent risk model in which we assume the vector of count variables to be a tree-structured Markov random field with Poisson marginals. The tree structure translates into a wide variety of dependence schemes. We study the global risk of the portfolio and the risk allocation to all its constituents. We provide asymptotic results for portfolios defined on infinitely growing trees. To illustrate its flexibility and computational scalability to higher dimensions, we calibrate the risk model on real-world extreme rainfall data and perform a risk analysis.</description>
