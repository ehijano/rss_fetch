      <title>Impact of topography and combustion functions on fire front propagation in an advection-diffusion-reaction model for wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the recent increase in wildfires, developing a better understanding of their dynamics is crucial. For this purpose, the advection-diffusion-reaction model has been widely used to study wildfire dynamics. In this study, we introduce the previously unconsidered influence of topography through an additional advective term. Furthermore, we propose a linear term for the combustion function, comparing it with the commonly used Arrhenius law to offer a simpler model for further analysis. Our findings on the model's dynamics are supported by numerical simulations showing the differences of model extensions and approximations.</description>

      <title>Particle Re-Suspension in Two-Phase Dispersed Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process by which particles are entrained by the fluid in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection is studied by means of particle-resolved numerical simulations in a periodic domain at a Rayleigh number of $10^7$. The fluid Prandtl number is 1 and the particle-to-fluid density ratio 1.1. The results show that the horizontal velocity field near the bottom of the cell accumulates particles in heaps, or `dunes', at the base of ascending plumes. The dunes deflect the incoming flow, conferring to it a vertical velocity component which entrains the particles up the dune and into the plume. An experimental observation of this mechanism was briefly reported by Solomatov et al. (Earth Planet. Sc. Lett. 120, 387, 1993) but has not been considered further in the literature. By its very nature, such a process cannot be simulated by the point particle model. The final particle load carried by the convection depends both on the available gravitational energy of the fluid and on the effectiveness of the re-suspension mechanism.</description>

      <title>Elastoinertial turbulence: Data-driven reduced-order model based on manifold dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic state that emerges in the flows of dilute polymer solutions. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of EIT is highly computationally expensive due to the need to resolve the multi-scale nature of the system. While DNS of 2D EIT typically requires $O(10^6)$ degrees of freedom, we demonstrate here that a data-driven modeling framework allows for the construction of an accurate model with 50 degrees of freedom. We achieve a low-dimensional representation of the full state by first applying a viscoelastic variant of proper orthogonal decomposition to DNS results, and then using an autoencoder. The dynamics of this low-dimensional representation are learned using the neural ODE method, which approximates the vector field for the reduced dynamics as a neural network. The resulting low-dimensional data-driven model effectively captures short-time dynamics over the span of one correlation time, as well as long-time dynamics, particularly the self-similar, nested traveling wave structure of 2D EIT in the parameter range considered.</description>

      <title>On the emergence of criticality for inhalation-driven particle deposition in the anatomical upper airway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhalation directs air through a defined pathway, initiating from nostrils, moving through the main nasal cavity, past the pharynx and trachea, and culminating in the lungs. Inhaled particles, of a range of sizes, are ferried by this incoming air but are filtered and trapped by upper airway structures to protect the delicate lower respiratory system. From an energetics perspective, the airflow physics along this convoluted tract is characterized by turbulence. The system approaches a critical stationary state over the time scales during which particles enter the airway and deposit. This stasis can be conjectured to correspond with the emergence of criticality in the complex flow domain. For such systemic criticality (i.e., sensitivity to perturbations), inhaled particle deposition impacted by the surrounding flow processes can act as signature avalanche-like events. Based on the principles of organized criticality, we have explored the emergence of power law trends in particle deposition levels at the nasopharynx, a key initial infection site for airborne pathogens. These trends are derived from numerical data from five anatomic airway geometries for 15-85 L/min inhalation rates, modeled using high-fidelity Large Eddy Simulations.</description>

      <title>Extending Kolmogorov Theory to Polymeric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The addition of polymers fundamentally alters the dynamics of turbulent flows in a way that defies Kolmogorov predictions. However, we now present a formalism that reconciles our understanding of polymeric turbulence with the classical Kolmogorov phenomenology. This is achieved by relying on an appropriate form of the K\'{a}rm\'{a}n-Howarth-Monin-Hill relation, which motivates the definition of extended velocity increments and the associated structure functions, by accounting for the influence of the polymers on the flow. We show, both analytically and numerically, that the ${\rm p}$th-order extended structure functions exhibit a power-law behaviour in the elasto-inertial range of scales, with exponents deviating from the analytically predicted value of ${\rm p}/3$. These deviations are readily accounted for by considering local averages of the total dissipation, rather than global averages, in analogy with the refined similarity hypotheses of Kolmogorov for classical Newtonian turbulence. We also demonstrate the scale-invariance of multiplier statistics of extended velocity increments, whose distributions collapse well for a wide range of scales.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Modelling and Closed-Loop Control of the Cylinder Wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model-based approach for the closed-loop control of vortex shedding in the cylinder wake. The control objective is to suppress the unsteadiness of the flow, which arises at a critical Reynolds number $Re_c$ through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. In the vicinity of $Re_c$ the flow is well described by a forced Stuart-Landau equation derived via a global weakly nonlinear analysis. This Stuart-Landau equation governs the evolution of the amplitude $A$ of the global mode on the slow time scale. In this paper, we generalize the approach from [Sipp 2012], which considers a fixed-amplitude harmonic forcing, by allowing the forcing amplitude E0 to vary on the slow time scale. This enables the design of closed-loop controllers for multiple surrogate Stuart-Landau models, which we obtain for different classes of forcing frequencies. When these frequencies are near the global mode oscillation frequency at Rec, we can bring both $A$ and $E'$ to zero, which fully suppresses the unsteady part of the flow. We also show that near this frequency, the optimal forcing structure is in the direction of the adjoint global mode. Assuming partial velocity measurements of the flow, we design an output-feedback control law that stabilizes the flow. The approach hinges on a model predictive controller for the surrogate model, which exploits the full-order model measurements to determine the necessary forcing amplitudes while respecting the modelling constraints. We achieve suppression of the wake oscillations with spatially dense volume forcing and two-point velocity measurement at $Re=50$.</description>

      <title>Force balances in spherical shell rotating convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made in understanding planetary core dynamics using numerical models of rotating convection (RC) in spherical shell geometry. However, the behaviour of forces in these models within various dynamic regimes of RC remains largely unknown. Directional anisotropy, scale dependence, and the role of dynamically irrelevant gradient contributions in incompressible flows complicate the representation of dynamical balances. In this study, we systematically compare integrated and scale-dependent representations of mean and fluctuation forces and curled forces (which contain no gradient contributions) separately for the three components ($\hat{r},\hat{\theta},\hat{\phi}$). The analysis is performed with simulations in a range of convective supercriticality $Ra/Ra_c=1.2-1967$ and Ekman number $E=10^{-3}-10^{-6}$, with fixed Prandtl number $Pr=1$, no-slip and fixed flux boundaries. We exclude $10$ velocity boundary layers from the spherical shell boundaries, to get a consistent representation of the dynamics between the force and curled force balance. Radial, azimuthal and co-latitudinal components exhibit distinct balances. The total magnitudes of the mean forces and mean curled forces exhibit a primary thermal wind (TW) balance; the corresponding fluctuating forces are in a quasi-geostrophic (QG) primary balance, while the fluctuating curled forces transition from a Viscous-Archimedean-Coriolis balance to an Inertia-Viscous-Archimedean-Coriolis balance with increasing $Ra/Ra_c$. The curled force balances are weakly scale-dependent compared to the forces and do not show clear cross-over scales. The fluctuating force and curled force balances are consistent with three regimes of RC (weakly nonlinear, rapidly rotating, and weakly rotating), but do not exhibit sharp changes with $Ra/Ra_c$, which inhibits the identification of precise regime boundaries from these balances.</description>

      <title>Dam break of viscoplastic elliptical objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we numerically and theoretically analyze the physical mechanisms controlling the gravity-induced spreading of viscoplastic elliptical metric objects on a sticky solid surface (without sliding). The two-dimensional collapsing objects are described as Bingham fluids. The numerical simulations are based on a variational multi-scale approach devoted to multiphase non-Newtonian fluid flows. The results are depicted by considering the spreading dynamics, energy budgets, and new scaling laws. They show that, under negligible inertial effects, the driving gravitational energy of the elliptical columns is dissipated through viscoplastic effects during the collapse, giving rise to three flow regimes: gravito-viscous, gravito-plastic, and mixed gravito-visco-plastic. These regimes are strongly affected by the initial aspect ratio of the collapsing column, which reveals the possibility of using morphology to control spreading. Finally, the results are summarized in a diagram linking the object's maximum spreading and the collapse time with different collapsing regimes through a single dimensionless parameter called collapse number.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-dissipation theorems and the measurement of the Onsager coefficients for two-phase flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new methodology for the experimental measurement of the Onsager coefficients of porous media flows by application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The experimental setup consists of a steady-state flow condition in which two incompressible fluids are simultaneously injected into a modified Hele-Shaw cell. The cell is transparent and allows direct visualization of the dynamics via regular optical imaging methods. The fluctuations in the phase saturations are obtained and, by computing the temporal correlations of their time derivatives, we gain access to the Onsager coefficients. This work gives experimental grounding to recent theoretical development on the applications of the fluctuation-dissipation theorems to porous media flows.</description>

      <title>Neuroevolution of Decentralized Decision-Making in N-Bead Swimmers Leads to Scalable and Robust Collective Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09438v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many microorganisms swim by performing larger non-reciprocal shape deformations that are initiated locally by molecular motors. However, it remains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the entire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from coordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts using neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging long-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial microswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further optimization "out of the box". Our work is of relevance to understanding and developing robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial microswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of individuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using a formulation of a class of compressible viscous flows with a heat source via vorticity and expansion-rate, we study the Oberbeck-Boussinesq flows. To this end we establish a new integral representation for solutions of parabolic equations subject to certain boundary condition, which allows us to develop a random vortex method for certain compressible flows and to compute numerically solutions of their dynamical models. Numerical experiments are carried out, which not only capture detailed B\'enard convection but also are capable of providing additional information on the fluid density and the dynamics of expansion-rate of the flow.</description>

      <title>Inverse Magnus Effect Induced by Dilute Water Fog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse Magnus effect is a phenomenon in which a spinning sphere experiences a lift force opposite to the conventional Magnus effect. This effect is typically observed in the flow higher than a critical Reynolds number or spin ratio. We experimentally studied the inverse Magnus effect on a spinning sphere in a flow containing suspended micrometer size droplets. The lift force was measured by injecting droplets into a closed return wind tunnel. We investigated the threshold of the inverse Magnus effect for several types of dispersed droplets. Our results indicate that the flow with suspended water droplets significantly affects the onset of the inverse Magnus effect, causing a decrease in the critical Reynolds number and spin ratio.</description>

      <title>Focusing of concentric free-surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravito-capillary waves at free-surfaces are ubiquitous in several natural and industrial processes involving quiescent liquid pools bounded by cylindrical walls. These waves emanate from the relaxation of initial interface distortions, which often take the form of a cavity (depression) centred on the symmetry axis of the container. These surface waves reflect from the container walls leading to a radially inward propagating wave-train converging (focussing) onto the symmetry axis. Under the inviscid approximation and for sufficiently shallow cavities, the relaxation is well-described by the linearised potential-flow equations. Naturally, adding viscosity to such a system introduces viscous dissipation that enervates energy and dampens the oscillations at the symmetry axis.
  However, for viscous liquids and deeper cavities, these equations are qualitatively inaccurate. In this study, we elucidate a modal approach to study the initial-value problem for concentric gravito-capillary waves generated on a free-surface for inviscid as well as viscous liquids. For a sufficiently deep cavity, the inward focusing of waves results in large interfacial oscillations at the axis, necessitating a second-order nonlinear theory. We demonstrate that this theory effectively models the interfacial behavior and highlights the crucial role of nonlinearity near the symmetry axis. Contrary to expectations, the addition of slight viscosity further intensifies the oscillations at the symmetry axis. This finding underscores the limitations of the potential flow model and suggests avenues for more accurate modelling of such complex free-surface flows.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning for anisotropic p-adaptation and error estimation in high-order solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to automate and optimize anisotropic p-adaptation in high-order h/p solvers using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The dynamic RL adaptation uses the evolving solution to adjust the high-order polynomials. We develop an offline training approach, decoupled from the main solver, which shows minimal overcost when performing simulations. In addition, we derive an inexpensive RL-based error estimation approach that enables the quantification of local discretization errors. The proposed methodology is agnostic to both the computational mesh and the partial differential equation to be solved.
  The application of RL to mesh adaptation offers several benefits. It enables automated and adaptive mesh refinement, reducing the need for manual intervention. It optimizes computational resources by dynamically allocating high-order polynomials where necessary and minimizing refinement in stable regions. This leads to computational cost savings while maintaining the accuracy of the solution. Furthermore, RL allows for the exploration of unconventional mesh adaptations, potentially enhancing the accuracy and robustness of simulations. This work extends our original research, offering a more robust, reproducible, and generalizable approach applicable to complex three-dimensional problems. We provide validation for laminar and turbulent cases: circular cylinders, Taylor Green Vortex and a 10MW wind turbine to illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: A Monotonic, Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian Tracer Transport Scheme for Flow with Large Courant Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local conservation of mass and entropy are becoming increasingly desirable properties for modern numerical weather and climate models. This work presents a Flux-Form Semi-Lagrangian (FFSL) transport scheme, called SWIFT, that facilitates this conservation for tracer variables, whilst maintaining other vital properties such as preservation of a constant, monotonicity and positivity. Importantly, these properties all hold for large Courant numbers and multi-dimensional flow, making the scheme appropriate for use within a dynamical core which takes large time steps.
  The SWIFT scheme presented here can be seen as an evolution of the FFSL methods of Leonard et al and Lin and Rood. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional schemes consist of a splitting into a sequence of one-dimensional calculations. The new SWIFT splitting presented here allows monotonic and positivity properties from the one-dimensional calculations to be inherited by the multi-dimensional scheme. These one-dimensional calculations involve separating the mass flux into terms that correspond to integer and fractional parts of the Courant number. Key to achieving conservation is coupling the transport of tracers to the transport of the fluid density, through re-use of the discrete mass flux that was calculated from the fluid density in the transport of the tracers. This work also describes how these properties can still be attained when the tracer is vertically-staggered from the density in a Charney-Phillips grid.</description>
