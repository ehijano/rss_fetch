      <title>Periodic Solutions of a Delay Differential Equation with a Periodic Multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple non-autonomous scalar differential equation with delay, exponential decay, nonlinear negative feedback and a periodic multiplicative coefficient is considered. It is shown that stable slowly oscillating periodic solutions with the period of the feedback coefficient, and also with the double period of the feedback coefficient exist. The periodic solutions are built explicitly in the case of piecewise constant feedback function and the periodic coefficient. The periodic dynamics are shown to persist under small perturbations of the equation which make it smooth. The results are confirmed and illustrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>The strong unstable manifold and periodic solutions in differential delay equations with cyclic monotone negative feedbck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a class of $(N+1)$-dimensional systems of differential delay equations with a cyclic and monotone negative feedback structure, we construct a two-dimensional invariant manifold, on which phase curves spiral outward towards a bounding periodic orbit. For this to happen we assume essentially only instability of the zero equilibrium. Methods of the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theory due to Mallet-Paret and Sell are combined with techniques used by Walther for the scalar case $(N = 0)$. Statements on the attractor location and on parameter borders concerning stability and oscillation are included. The results apply to models for gene regulatory systems, e.g. the `repressilator' system.</description>

      <title>Learning Noise-Robust Stable Koopman Operator for Control with Physics-Informed Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel learning framework for Koopman operator of nonlinear dynamical systems that is informed by the governing equation and guarantees long-time stability and robustness to noise. In contrast to existing frameworks where either ad-hoc observables or blackbox neural networks are used to construct observables in the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our observables are informed by governing equations via Polyflow. To improve the noise robustness and guarantee long-term stability, we designed a stable parameterization of the Koopman operator together with a progressive learning strategy for roll-out recurrent loss. To further improve model performance in the phase space, a simple iterative strategy of data augmentation was developed. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear systems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques over several state-of-the-art practices.</description>

      <title>Improved dimension theory of sofic self-affine fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a combinatorial expression for the Hausdorff dimension of a given self-affine fractal in any Euclidean space. This formula includes the extension of the work by Kenyon and Peres (1996) on planar sofic sets and yields an exact value for the dimension of certain sofic sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ or higher. We also calculate the Minkowski dimension of sofic sets and establish a sufficient and presumably necessary condition for planar sofic sets to have the same Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension. The condition can be regarded as a generalization of the classical result for Bedford-McMullen carpets.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Deep Learning for Strain Gradient Continuum Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a space-time discretization based on physics informed deep learning (PIDL) to approximate solutions of a class of rate-dependent strain gradient plasticity models. The differential equation governing the plastic flow, the so-called microforce balance for this class of yield-free plasticity models, is very stiff, often leading to numerical corruption and a consequent lack of accuracy or convergence by finite element (FE) methods. Indeed, setting up the discretized framework, especially with an elaborate meshing around the propagating plastic bands whose locations are often unknown a-priori, also scales up the computational effort significantly. Taking inspiration from physics informed neural networks, we modify the loss function of a PIDL model in several novel ways to account for the balance laws, either through energetics or via the resulting PDEs once a variational scheme is applied, and the constitutive equations. The initial and the boundary conditions may either be imposed strictly by encoding them within the PIDL architecture, or enforced weakly as a part of the loss function. The flexibility in the implementation of a PIDL technique often makes for its ready interface with powerful optimization schemes, and this in turn provides for many possibilities in posing the problem. We have used freely available open-source libraries that perform fast, parallel computations on GPUs. Using numerical illustrations, we demonstrate how PIDL methods could address the computational challenges posed by strain gradient plasticity models. Also, PIDL methods offer abundant potentialities, vis-\'a-vis a somewhat straitjacketed and poorer approximant of FE methods, in customizing the formulation as per the problem objective.</description>

      <title>Robust chaos in a totally symmetric network of four phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide conditions on the coupling function such that a system of 4 globally coupled identical oscillators has chaotic attractors, a pair of Lorenz attractors or a 4-winged analogue of the Lorenz attractor. The attractors emerge near the triple instability threshold of the splay-phase synchronization state of the oscillators. We provide theoretical arguments and verify numerically, based on the pseudohyperbolicity test, that the chaotic dynamics are robust with respect to small, e.g. time-dependent, perturbations of the system. The robust chaoticity should also be inherited by any network of weakly interacting systems with such attractors.</description>

      <title>Kernel Sum of Squares for Data Adapted Kernel Learning of Dynamical Systems from Data: A global optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the application of the Kernel Sum of Squares (KSOS) method for enhancing kernel learning from data, particularly in the context of dynamical systems. Traditional kernel-based methods, despite their theoretical soundness and numerical efficiency, frequently struggle with selecting optimal base kernels and parameter tuning, especially with gradient-based methods prone to local optima. KSOS mitigates these issues by leveraging a global optimization framework with kernel-based surrogate functions, thereby achieving more reliable and precise learning of dynamical systems. Through comprehensive numerical experiments on the Logistic Map, Henon Map, and Lorentz System, KSOS is shown to consistently outperform gradient descent in minimizing the relative-$\rho$ metric and improving kernel accuracy. These results highlight KSOS's effectiveness in predicting the behavior of chaotic dynamical systems, demonstrating its capability to adapt kernels to underlying dynamics and enhance the robustness and predictive power of kernel-based approaches, making it a valuable asset for time series analysis in various scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Intersection of orbits for polynomials in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [GTZ08, GTZ12], the following result was established: given polynomials $f,g\in\mathbb{C}[x]$ of degrees larger than $1$, if there exist $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb{C}$ such that their corresponding orbits $\mathcal{O}_f(\alpha)$ and $\mathcal{O}_g(\beta)$ (under the action of $f$, respectively of $g$) intersect in infinitely many points, then $f$ and $g$ must share a common iterate, i.e., $f^m=g^n$ for some $m,n\in\mathbb{N}$. If one replaces $\mathbb{C}$ with a field $K$ of characteristic $p$, then the conclusion fails; we provide numerous examples showing the complexity of the problem over a field of positive characteristic. We advance a modified conjecture regarding polynomials $f$ and $g$ which admit two orbits with infinite intersection over a field of characteristic $p$. Then we present various partial results, along with connections with another deep conjecture in the area, the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Peano compactum is a compact metric space having locally connected components such that at most finitely many of them are of diameter greater than any fixed number C&gt;0. Given a compactum K in the extended complex plane, it is known that there is a finest upper semi-continuous decomposition of K into subcontinua such that the resulting quotient space is a Peano compactum. We call this decomposition the core decomposition of K with Peano quotient and its elements atoms of K. We show that for any branched covering f of the extended complex plane onto itself and for any atom d of K, the preimage of d under f has finitely many components each of which is an atom of the preimage of K under f. Since rational functions are branched coverings, our result extends earlier ones that are restricted to more limited cases, requiring that f be a polynomial and K completely invariant under f.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12950v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the spectral method for proving limit theorems to random non-uniformly expanding dynamical systems. This yields the CLT and moderate deviations principles (MDP). We show that as the amount of non-uniformity decreases the CLT rates and the speed in the MDP become closer to the optimal ones. For smooth systems the rates are effective. Compared to recent progress on the subject [34] we are able to consider much more general maps, Gibbs measures and observables. However, our main results are new even in the setup of [34].</description>

      <title>Interpolation sets for dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originating in harmonic analysis, interpolation sets were first studied in dynamics by Glasner and Weiss in the 1980s. A set $S \subset \mathbb{N}$ is an interpolation set for a class of topological dynamical systems $\mathcal{C}$ if any bounded sequence on $S$ can be extended to a sequence that arises from a system in $\mathcal{C}$. In this paper, we provide combinatorial characterizations of interpolation sets for:
  $\bullet$ (totally) minimal systems;
  $\bullet$ topologically (weak) mixing systems;
  $\bullet$ strictly ergodic systems; and
  $\bullet$ zero entropy systems.
  Additionally, we prove some results on a slightly different notion, called weak interpolation sets, for several classes of systems. We also answer a question of Host, Kra, and Maass concerning the connection between sets of pointwise recurrence for distal systems and $IP$-sets.</description>

Abstract: Define the map $\mathsf{T}$ on the positive integers by $\mathsf{T}(m)=\frac{m}{2}$ if $m$ is even and by $\mathsf{T}(m)=\frac{3m+1}{2}$ if $m$ is odd. Results of Terras and Everett imply that, given any $\epsilon&gt;0$, almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (in the sense of natural density) fulfill $(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^km^{1-\epsilon}\leq \mathsf{T}^k(m)\leq (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^km^{1+\epsilon}$ simultaneously for all $0\leq k\leq \alpha\log m$ with $\alpha=(\log 2)^{-1}\approx 1.443$. We extend this result to $\alpha=2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\approx 6.952$, which is the maximally possible value. Set $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m):=\min_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathsf{T}^n(m)$. As an immediate consequence, one has $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq\mathsf{T}^{\left\lfloor2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}\log m\right\rfloor}(m)\leq m^{\epsilon}$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ for any given $\epsilon&gt;0$. Previously, Korec has shown that $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq m^\epsilon$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ if $\epsilon&gt;\frac{\log3}{\log4}$, and recently Tao proved that $\mathsf{T}_{\min}(m)\leq f(m)$ for almost all $m\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ (in the sense of logarithmic density) for all functions $f$ diverging to $\infty$. Denote by $\tau(m)$ the minimal $n\in\mathbb{N}$ for which $\mathsf{T}^n(m)=1$ if there exists such an $n$ and set $\tau(m)=\infty$ otherwise. As another application, we show that $\liminf_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{x\log x}\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\tau(m)\geq 2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}$, partially answering a question of Crandall and Shanks. Under the assumption that the Collatz Conjecture is true in the strong sense that $\tau(m)$ is in $O(\log m)$, we show that $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{x\log x}\sum_{m=1}^{\lfloor x\rfloor}\tau(m)= 2(\log\frac{4}{3})^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A statistical physics and dynamical systems perspective on geophysical extreme events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical physics and dynamical systems theory are key tools to study high-impact geophysical events such as temperature extremes, cyclones, thunderstorms, geomagnetic storms and many more. Despite the intrinsic differences between these events, they all originate as temporary deviations from the typical trajectories of a geophysical system, resulting in well-organised, coherent structures at characteristic spatial and temporal scales. While statistical extreme value analysis techniques are capable to provide return times and probabilities of occurrence of certain geophysical events, they are not apt to account for their underlying physics. Their focus is to compute the probability of occurrence of events that are large or small with respect to some specific observable (e.g. temperature, precipitation, solar wind), rather than to relate rare or extreme phenomena to the underlying anomalous geophysical regimes. This paper outlines this knowledge gap, presenting some related challenges, new formalisms and briefly commenting on how stochastic approaches tailored to the study of extreme geophysical events can help to advance their understanding.</description>

      <title>Efficient Equidistribution of Nilsequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10772v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give improved bounds for the equidistribution of (multiparameter) nilsequences subject to any degree filtration. The bounds we obtain are single exponential in dimension, improving on double exponential bounds of Green and Tao. To obtain these bounds, we overcome "induction of dimension'' which is ubiquitous throughout higher order Fourier analysis.
  The improved equidistribution theory is a crucial ingredient in the quasi-polynomial $U^4[N]$ inverse theorem of the author and its extension to the quasi-polynomial $U^{s + 1}[N]$ inverse theorem in joint work with Sah and Sawhney. These results lead to further applications in combinatorial number theory such as bounds for linear equations in the primes which save an arbitrary power of logarithm, which match the bounds Vinogradov obtained for the odd Goldbach conjecture.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations of the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Allen--Cahn equation, a prototypical model problem in nonlinear dynamics that exhibits bifurcations corresponding to variations of a deterministic bifurcation parameter. Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we introduce a random coefficient in the linear reaction part of the equation, thereby accounting for random, spatially-heterogeneous effects. Importantly, we assume a spatially constant, deterministic mean value of the random coefficient. We show that this mean value is in fact a bifurcation parameter in the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients. Moreover, we show that the bifurcation points and bifurcation curves become random objects. We consider two distinct modelling situations: (i) for a spatially homogeneous coefficient we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of the bifurcation points and show that the bifurcation curves are random shifts of a fixed reference curve; (ii) for a spatially heterogeneous coefficient we employ a generalized polynomial chaos expansion to approximate the statistical properties of the random bifurcation points and bifurcation curves. We present numerical examples in 1D physical space, where we combine the popular software package Continuation Core and Toolboxes (CoCo) for numerical continuation and the Sparse Grids Matlab Kit for the polynomial chaos expansion. Our exposition addresses both, dynamical systems and uncertainty quantification, highlighting how analytical and numerical tools from both areas can be combined efficiently for the challenging uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations in random differential equations.</description>

      <title>A hybrid framework for compartmental models enabling simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-scale systems often exhibit stochastic and deterministic dynamics. Capturing these aspects in a compartmental model is challenging. Notably, low occupancy compartments exhibit stochastic dynamics and high occupancy compartments exhibit deterministic dynamics. Failing to account for stochasticity in small populations can produce 'atto-foxes', e.g. in the Lotka-Volterra ordinary differential equation (ODE) model. This limitation becomes problematic when studying extinction of species or the clearance of infection, but it can be resolved by using discrete stochastic models e.g. continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs). Unfortunately, simulating CTMCs is infeasible for most realistic populations.
  We develop a novel mathematical framework, to couple continuous ODEs and discrete CTMCs: 'Jump-Switch-Flow' (JSF). In this framework populations can reach extinct states ("absorbing states"), thereby resolving atto-fox-type problems. JSF has the desired behaviours of exact CTMC simulation, but is substantially faster than existing alternatives.
  JSF's utility for simulation-based inference, particularly multi-scale problems, is demonstrated by several case-studies. In a simulation study, we demonstrate how JSF can enable a more nuanced analysis of the efficacy of public health interventions. We also carry out a novel analysis of longitudinal within-host data from SARS-CoV-2 infections to quantify the timing of viral clearance. JSF offers a novel approach to compartmental model development and simulation.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Filters Using Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filtering - the task of estimating the conditional distribution of states of a dynamical system given partial, noisy, observations - is important in many areas of science and engineering, including weather and climate prediction. However, the filtering distribution is generally intractable to obtain for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Filters used in practice, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), are biased for nonlinear systems and have numerous tuning parameters. Here, we present a framework for learning a parameterized analysis map - the map that takes a forecast distribution and observations to the filtering distribution - using variational inference. We show that this methodology can be used to learn gain matrices for filtering linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as inflation and localization parameters for an EnKF. Future work will apply this framework to learn new filtering algorithms.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>
