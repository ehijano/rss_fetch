      <title>The Gr\"uneisen parameter applied to critical phenomena and experimental investigations of correlated phenomena in molecular conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Ph.D. Thesis, a systematic review is performed on the derivation and generalization of the Gr\"uneisen parameter followed by its unprecedented applications to several distinct scenarios, such as magnetic model systems, zero-field quantum phase transitions, the maximization of caloric effects close to any critical-end point based on entropy arguments, the here-proposed adiabatic magnetization of a paramagnetic salt, as well as for Cosmology in the frame of the universe expansion. Since this Ph.D. Thesis is a symbiosis between theoretical and experimental results, an experimental investigation of correlated phenomena was carried out for molecular conductors of the (TMTTF)$_2$X family, where TMTTF is the base molecule tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and X a monovalent counter-anion such as PF$_6$, SbF$_6$, or AsF$_6$. Such strongly correlated electron systems are considered suitable ones for the exploration of Mott insulating phase, charge-ordering, spin-Peierls, and superconductivity. In particular, the investigation of a possible multiferroic character in these salts was performed via quasi-static (low-frequency) dielectric constant $\varepsilon'$ measurements as a function of temperature where a maximum in $\varepsilon'$ as a function of temperature was observed at the corresponding charge-ordering temperature for both hydrogenated and 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$SbF$_6$ salts. Furthermore, Raman measurements were performed on the 97.5% deuterated (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$, showing a possible magneto-optical effect on the $\nu_4(a_g)$ vibrational mode of the TMTTF molecule. Yet, fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the fully-hydrogenated (TMTTF)$_2$AsF$_6$ presents an expressive fluorescence background, which is roughly five orders of magnitude lower than that for the 97.5% deuterated variant of (TMTTF)$_2$PF$_6$.</description>

      <title>Superconducting $p$-wave pairing effects on one-dimensional non-Hermitian quasicrystals with power law hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of superconducting $p$-wave pairing on the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law hopping. For the case of short-range hopping, weak pairing leads to oscillating quasi-Majorana zero modes, turning to edge-localized Majorana zero modes as pairing strength increases. For the case of long-range hopping, we observe the emergence of massive Dirac modes having oscillatory behavior, similar to Majorana modes with weak pairing. The massive Dirac modes localize at the edges as the pairing strength grows. The superconducting pairing spoils the plateaus observed in the fractal dimension of all the energy eigenstates of the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper model with power-law hopping. The number of plateaus decreases with the increasing pairing strength for the weak non-Hermiticity in the system. The phase diagram of the system reveals that real and complex energy spectrums correlate differently with the localization properties of the eigenstates depending on the strength of pairing and hopping range.</description>

      <title>An unusual phase transition in a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article studies a non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model which has periodically staggered Hermitian and non-Hermitian dimers. The changes in topological phases of the considered chiral symmetric model with respect to the introduced non-Hermiticity are studied where we find that the system supports only complex eigenspectra for all values of $u \neq 0$ and it stabilizes only non-trivial insulating phase for higher loss-gain strength. Even if the system acts as a trivial insulator in the Hermitian limit, the increase in loss-gain strength induces phase transition to non-trivial insulating phase through a (gapless) semi-metallic phase. Interesting phenomenon is observed in the case where Hermitian system acts as a non-trivial insulator. In such a situation, the introduced non-Hermiticity neither leaves the non-trivial phase undisturbed nor induces switching to trivial phase. Rather, it shows transition from non-trivial insulating phase to the same where it is mediated by the stabilization of (non-trivial) semi-metallic phase. This unusual transition between the non-trivial insulating phases through non-trivial semi-metallic phase gives rise to a question regarding the topological states of the system under open boundary conditions. So, we analyze the possibility of stable edge states in these two non-trivial insulating phases and check the characteristic difference between them. In addition, we study the nature of topological states in the case of non-trivial gapless (semi-metallic) region.</description>

      <title>Noise-Robust Detection of Quantum Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing allows for the manipulation of highly correlated states whose properties quickly go beyond the capacity of any classical method to calculate. Thus one natural problem which could lend itself to quantum advantage is the study of ground-states of condensed matter models, and the transitions between them. However, current levels of hardware noise can require extensive application of error-mitigation techniques to achieve reliable computations. In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in a simple, noise-robust manner which is agnostic to the method of ground state preparation. This work shows promising potential for near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, including avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Electron conductance and many-body marker of a cavity-embedded topological 1D chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate many-body topological and transport properties of a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) topological chain coupled to the quantum field of a cavity mode. The quantum conductance is determined via Green's function formalism in terms of the light-matter eigenstates calculated via exact diagonalization for a finite number of electrons. We show that the topology of the cavity-embedded many-electron system is described by a generalized electron-photon Zak marker. We reveal how the quantization of transport is modified by the cavity vacuum fields for a finite-size chain and how it is impacted by electronic disorder. Moreover, we show that electron-photon entanglement produces dramatic differences with respect to the predictions of mean-field theory, which strongly underestimates cavity-modified transport.</description>
