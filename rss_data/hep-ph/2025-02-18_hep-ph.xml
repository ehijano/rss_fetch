      <title>Complex potential and open system applications in heavy-ions and cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of the complex potential of quarkonium at high temperatures, quarkonium has been regarded as an open quantum system in the quark-gluon plasma. Recently, a similar issue regarding in-medium bound states of impurities has also emerged in particle physics and cold atomic physics. We will provide an overview of recent advancements in understanding key quantities such as complex potential and transport coefficients for heavy impurities in finite temperature QCD and cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of lattice gluon dataset on CTEQ-TEA global PDFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the latest gluon parton results from lattice QCD on the global parton distribution function (PDF) analysis within the CTEQ-TEA framework. The dependence on PDF parameterization is explored using the CT18As variant, incorporating the ATLAS 7 TeV precision $W,Z$ dataset and introducing more flexible parameters to allow strangeness asymmetry at the starting scale $Q_0$. The interplay between lattice input and collider inclusive jet datasets is examined by including the post-CT18 inclusive jet datasets from recent LHC measurements and/or removing all collider inclusive jet datasets. Finally, we demonstrate several phenomenological implications at the LHC, focusing on gluon-gluon parton luminosity and related processes, such as the production of a Higgs-like scalar, top-quark pairs, and their associated production with an additional jet, Higgs, or $Z$ boson.</description>

      <title>Tensor interaction in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino tensor interactions have gained prominence in the study of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) recently. We perform a systematical examination of the nuclear effect, which plays a crucial role in evaluating the cross section of CE$\nu$NS in the presence of tensor interactions. Our analysis reveals that the CE$\nu$NS cross section induced by tensor interactions is not entirely nuclear spin-suppressed and can be enhanced by a few orders of magnitude compared to the conventional studies. The neutrino magnetic moment induced by the loop effect of tensor interactions, is also taken into account due to its sizable contribution to the CE$\nu$NS cross section. We also employ data from the COHERENT experiment and recent observations of solar $^8$B neutrinos from dark matter direct detection experiments to scrutinize the parameter space of neutrino tensor interactions.</description>

      <title>Triply heavy tetraquark states with different flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $S$-wave triply heavy tetraquark systems, including the $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar Q^{(\prime)}\bar q$ and $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar Q^{(\prime)}\bar s$ configurations ($Q^{(\prime)} = c, b$, $q = u, d$) with spin-parity $J^P = 0^+$, $1^+$, and $2^+$, within the framework of the constituent quark model. We construct the wave functions for these systems, incorporating complete color-spin wave functions and spatial wave functions with three different Jacobi coordinate configurations. We use complex scaling and Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled four-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation and obtain possible exotic states. To analyze the spatial properties of the tetraquark states, we compute the root-mean-square (rms) radii, which help distinguish between meson-molecular and compact tetraquark states. We find that there do not exist any bound states in the $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar Q^{(\prime)}\bar q$ and $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar Q^{(\prime)}\bar s$ systems. However, we identify a possible molecular resonant state $T_{3c,2}(5819)$ in the $cc\bar c\bar q$ system with spin-parity $J^P = 2^+$, which lies slightly above the $J/\psi D^*(2S)$ threshold and has a large rms radius around 2.2 fm. Furthermore, we obtain a series of compact resonant states, some of which exhibit spatial structure similar to the tritium atom in QED, where the light quark circles around the cluster of three heavy quarks. The lowest resonant state in the triply heavy systems has a mass of $5634$ MeV, a width of $16$ MeV and spin-parity $J^P=1^+$. We suggest searching for this state in the $J/\psi D$, $\eta_c D^*$, and $J/\psi D^*$ decay channels.</description>

      <title>Impact of unitarity violation on sensitivity of the leptonic CP phase at Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of unitarity violation on the sensitivity of the leptonic CP phase, $\delta_{CP}$, considering the next generation of long-baseline neutrino experiments, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE. By simulating near and far detectors and assuming different scenarios for non-unitarity, we verify how it can affect the sensitivity to measure the $\delta_{ CP}$ violating phase. We also probe the capability of these experiments to constrain the non-unitarity parameters and how their capability could be improved if the impact of non-unitarity at both near and the far detectors were properly taken into account. We find that the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment is robust in the presence of non-unitarity mixing, achieving a sensitivity above $5\sigma$ for our all considered cases. On the other hand, DUNE suffers somewhat more impact due to unitarity violation, reaching a sensitivity below 5$\sigma$ for some values of $\delta_{CP}$. However, depending on the scenario adopted for non-unitarity, DUNE demonstrates robustness in the sensitivity to $\delta_{ CP}$ phase.</description>

      <title>Prospects for supersymmetry at high luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY) is highly motivated in that it provides a 't Hooft technically natural solution to the gauge hierarchy problem. However, recent strong limits from superparticle searches at LHC Run 2 may exacerbate a so-called Little Hierarchy problem (LHP) which is a matter of practical naturalness: why is m_{weak}&lt;&lt; m_{soft}? We review recent LHC and WIMP dark matter search bounds as well as their impact on a variety of proposed SUSY models: gravity-, gauge-, anomaly-, mirage- and gaugino-mediation along with some dark matter proposals such as well-tempered neutralinos. We address the naturalness question. We also address the emergence of the string landscape at the beginning of the 21st century and its impact on expectations for SUSY. Rather generally, the string landscape statistically prefers large soft SUSY breaking terms but subject to the anthropic requirement that the derived value of the weak scale for each pocket universe (PU) within the greater multiverse lies with the ABDS window of values. This {\it stringy natural} (SN) approach implies m_h~ 125 GeV more often than not with sparticles beyond or well-beyond present LHC search limits. We review detailed reach calculations of the high-lumi LHC (HL-LHC) for non-universal Higgs mass models which present perhaps the most plausible realization of SUSY from the string landscape. In contrast to conventional wisdom, from a stringy naturalness point of view, the search for SUSY at LHC has only just begun to explore the interesting regimes of parameter space. We comment on how non-universal Higgs models could be differentiated from other expressions of natural SUSY such as natural anomaly-mediation and natural mirage mediation at HL-LHC.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

      <title>Branching fraction, $CP$ asymmetry, and polarization in $B\to\rho\rho$ decays with the modified perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the observables associated with the $B\to\rho\rho$ decays, including branching fractions, $CP$ asymmetry parameters, and longitudinal polarization fractions in the perturbative QCD (PQCD) approach with a few improvements. The essential distinction between this study and previous works lies in the introduction of an infrared cutoff at the critical scale $\mu_c$, which is approximately at the scale of $1\;\text{GeV}$. The contributions above the critical scale are calculated using the PQCD approach, consistent with earlier studies, while the contributions below the scale $\mu_c$ are regarded as nonperturbative and represented by some soft form factors. In addition, the distribution amplitude of the $B$ meson, derived from the relativistic potential model, and the contributions from the color-octet quark-antiquark components are also taken into account. With these modifications, we find that the theoretical results agree well with the experimental measurements for most observables, the introduction of the infrared cutoff enhances the reliability of the perturbation calculations, and the color-octet contributions play a key role in explaining the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavor multimodal fragmentation to $S$-wave pentacharms at next-generation hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the leading-power fragmentation of fully charmed pentaquark states ($S$-wave $|c\bar{c}ccc\rangle$ pentacharms) at hadron colliders. We introduce a new set of hadron-structure-oriented, multimodal collinear fragmentation functions, named PQ5Q1.0. They rely on an enhanced calculation of the initial-scale input for the constituent heavy-quark fragmentation channel, making them well suited to describe the short-distance emission of either a compact multicharm state or a dicharm-charm-dicharm configuration. To explore phenomenological implications, we use the (sym)JETHAD multimodular interface to study NLL/NLO$^+$ semi-inclusive production rates for pentacharm-plus-jet systems at the forthcoming HL-LHC and the future FCC. Our analysis represents a further step toward bridging the domains of hadronic structure, precision QCD, and exotic matter.</description>

      <title>Contributions of $\rho(770,1450)\to \omega\pi$ for the Cabibbo-favored $D \to h\omega\pi$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the BESIII Collaboration has observed three-body decays $D_s^+\to \eta \omega\pi^+$, $D^+\to K^0_S\pi^+\omega$ and $D^0\to K^-\pi^+\omega$. In this work, we investigate the contributions of the subprocesses $\rho^+\to \omega\pi^+$ in these Cabibbo-favored decays $D \to h\omega\pi$, with $\rho^+= \{\rho(770)^+, \rho(1450)^+, \rho(770)^+\&amp;\rho(1450)^+\}$ and $h=\{ \eta, K^0_S, K^-\}$, by introducing these subprocesses into the decay amplitudes of the relevant decay processes via the vector form factor $F_{\omega\pi}$ measured in the related $\tau$ and $e^+e^-$ processes; we provide the first theoretical predictions for the branching fractions of the quasi-two-body decays $D_s^+\to\eta[\rho^+\to]\omega\pi^+$, $D^+\to K^0_S[\rho^+\to]\omega\pi^+$ and $D^0\to K^-[\rho^+\to]\omega\pi^+$. Our findings reveal that the contributions from the subprocess $\rho(770)^+\to\omega\pi^+$ are significant in these observed three-body decays $D_s^+\to\eta \omega\pi^+$, $D^+\to K^0_S \omega\pi^+$ and $D^0\to K^- \omega\pi^+$, notwithstanding the contributions originating from the Breit-Wigner tail effect of $\rho(770)^+$. The numerical results of this study suggest that these Cabibbo-favored three-body decays are dominated by the contributions come from the $P$-wave intermediate states $\rho(770)^+$, $\rho(1450)^+$ and their interference effects.</description>

      <title>Natural weak mixing angle under $\text{U}(1, 3)$ colored gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colored gravity, based on $\text{U}(1,3)$ symmetry, emerges naturally in the complexification of Lorentzian manifolds and integrates U(1) electromagnetism as a subcase. This work explores the viability of also including strong and electroweak interactions under the $\text{U}(1,3)$ gauge group of colored gravity. We identify specific generators linked to leptonic and quark interactions and embed the standard Higgs mechanism. Crucially, the weak mixing angle ($\sin^2\theta_W$) is predicted to exhibit about $\sim0.231$ for lepton-lepton interactions (close to observations) and $\sim0.222$ for hadron-lepton interactions, which is in 3$\sigma$ tension with some observations. These findings open pathways for reconciling experimental data with colored gravity and suggest avenues for quantum correction studies.</description>

      <title>Probing the sensitivity of semi-visible jets to current LHC measurements using the CONTUR toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-visible jets arise from a hypothetical, strongly interacting ``dark sector'' -- a dark counterpart of quantum chromodynamics whose partial decays back to Standard Model particles introduce new types of collider BSM signature. CMS and ATLAS have have searched for semi-visible jets in the resonant and non-resonant production modes and set constraints on mediator mass values. In this work, indirect constraints on various model parameters, such as dark hadron masses and coupling strengths, are explored using LHC measurements.</description>

      <title>Flavor dependence of Energy-energy correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-energy correlators (EECs) within high energy jets serve as a key experimentally accessible quantity to probe the scale and structure of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The CMS Collaboration's first measurement of the modification to the EEC within single inclusive jets in Pb+Pb collisions relative to p+p collisions reveals a significant enhancement at small angles, which may arise from jet transverse momentum $p_T$ selection biases due to jet energy loss. We investigate the dependence of jet EECs on the flavor of the initiating parton. The EEC distribution of a gluon jet is broader and the peak of transition from perturbative to non-perturbative regime occurs at a larger angle than a quark jet. Such flavor dependence leads to the different EECs for $\gamma$-jets and single inclusive jets due to their different flavor composition. It is also responsible for a colliding energy dependence of EECs of single inclusive jets at fixed jet energy. We also investigate the impact of flavor composition variation on the $p_T$ dependence of the jet EEC. We further propose that a change in the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions compared to p+p can also contribute to a non-negligible enhancement of the medium modified EEC at small angles. Using the \textsc{Jewel} model, we predict the reduction of the gluon jet fraction in A+A collisions and estimate its impact on the EEC.</description>

Abstract: We have studied the impact of CP-violating (CPV) effects on electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) and the electric dipole moment (EDM) of electron ($d_e$), the electric dipole moment (EDM) of mercury neutron ($d_n$) and the electric dipole moment (EDM) of ($d_{Hg}$) in an extension of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The model incorporating a $SU(2)$ triplet with hypercharges of $\pm1$ and a gauge singlet from the standard model that is mutually coupled, is collectively referred to as the next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model with triplets (TNMSSM). Furthermore, we discuss the strong first-order phase transition (PT) achieved by this model via tree-level effects. The numerical results indicate that the TNMSSM can account for the observed baryon asymmetry. Additionally, the regions favored by EWBG can be compatible with the corresponding electron EDM bounds when different contributions to the $d_e$ cancel each other out.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the data on differential cross sections and spin density matrix elements for $\gamma p \to \rho^0 p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly published data on spin density matrix elements from the GlueX Collaboration, along with the previously released differential cross-section data from the CLAS Collaboration and the other two experiments for the $\gamma p \to \rho^0 p$ reaction, are systematically investigated using an effective Lagrangian approach within the tree-level Born approximation. The model combines contributions from $t$-channel meson exchanges ($\pi$, $\eta$, and $f_2$), $s$-channel nucleon ($N$) and nucleon resonance ($N^\ast$) exchanges, $u$-channel $N$ exchange, and a generalized contact term to construct the scattering amplitudes. Regge propagators are employed for $t$-channel amplitudes to incorporate the contributions from mesons with various spins lying on the same trajectories. The analysis shows that the background contributions, dominated by the $f_2$-trajectory exchange, provide a satisfactory description of the data in the high-energy and forward-angle regions. The inclusion of specific nucleon resonances, such as $N(2100)1/2^{+}$, $N(2060)5/2^{-}$, or $\Delta(2000)5/2^{+}$, significantly improves the description of the differential cross-section data at near-perpendicular scattering angles in the low-energy region. Predictions of photon beam and target nucleon asymmetries are provided, offering valuable insights to discriminate reaction mechanisms when corresponding data become available in the future.</description>

      <title>Study of the $c\bar{c}s\bar{s}$ system in the chiral quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a charmonium $X(3960)$ in $B$ decays in the $D_s^+D_s^-$ invariant-mass spectrum is discovered by the LHCb Collaboration with the quantum number $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. Motivated by the discovery, in this work, we systematically investigated the $c\bar{c}s\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with the quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}, 1^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}$ in the framework of the chiral quark model(CQM). In our calculations, we considered the meson-meson structure of the tetraquark states and the diquark-antidiquark structure, as well as the channel-coupling of all channels of these two configurations are considered in this work. For example, all color structures including color singlet, hidden color channel, and the mixing of them are also taken into account. The numerical results indicates that no bound states were found in our model. But there exist several resonant states by using the stabilization method, the real scaling method (RSM) so called. Among these states, the $0^{++}$ resonant state with mass 3927 MeV matches very well with the energy of the newly discovered exotic state $X(3960)$ reported by the LHCb collaboration. As a result, our calculations suggest that $X(3960)$ can be interpreted as a $c\bar{c}s\bar{s}$ tetraquark state with quantum number $J^{PC}=0^{++}$. Apart form that, we also find several resonance states with mass 4179 MeV, 4376 MeV with $0^{++}$. For $1^{++}$, there is likely one resonance state in the energy range of 4310$\sim$4336 MeV, along with two resonance states at the energy of 4395 MeV and 4687 MeV, respectively. Besides, two resonance states at 4300 MeV and 4355 MeV for $1^{+-}$, as well as one state at 4788 MeV for $2^{++}$, are found, which are likely to be new exotic states. More experimental data is needed to confirm the existence of these resonance states.</description>

      <title>Exploring the BSM parameter space with Neural Network aided Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the issues that make sampling parameter spaces of various beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios computationally expensive are the high dimensionality of the input parameter space, complex likelihoods, and stringent experimental constraints. In this work, we explore likelihood-free approaches, leveraging neural network-aided Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to alleviate this issue. We focus on three amortized SBI methods: Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE), and Neural Ratio Estimation (NRE) and perform a comparative analysis through the validation test known as the \textit{ Test of Accuracy with Random Points} (TARP), as well as through posterior sample efficiency and computational time. As an example, we focus on the scalar sector of the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric SM (pMSSM) and observe that the NPE method outperforms the others and generates correct posterior distributions of the parameters with a minimal number of samples. The efficacy of this framework will be more evident with additional experimental data, especially for high dimensional parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing late-time annihilations of oscillating asymmetric dark matter via rotation curves of galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the Oscillating Asymmetric Dark Matter (OADM) model to address the core-cusp problem, aiming to resolve the discrepancy between the predictions of the $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ cosmological model and the observed dark matter profiles in dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The reactivation of dark matter annihilation during the structure formation epoch is possible if there is a small Majorana mass term that breaks the conservation of dark matter particle number, leading to oscillations between dark matter and its antiparticle. We analyzed the effects of the annihilation mechanism in the galaxy rotation curves of the SPARC and LITTLE THINGS catalogs. We searched for the characteristics of the OADM model which best describes the data. Our results show that the OADM model can successfully turn originally cusp-type halos into core-type ones according to our data sample.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a pedagogical introduction to non-particle dark matter, focused on primordial black holes (PBHs), black holes that may form in the early Universe from large overdensities. First, we outline the key properties of PBHs and how they meet the requirements to be a dark matter candidate. We then overview how PBHs can form, in particular from the collapse of large density perturbations generated by inflation (a proposed period of accelerated expansion in the early Universe). Next, we describe how PBHs can be probed by observations. Finally, we conclude with a summary focused on the key open questions in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to experimentally access the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the charged pion $\pi^+$ through the Sullivan process in electron-proton scattering. We demonstrate that the cross sections of $J/\psi$-photoproduction and $\phi$-electroproduction near the respective thresholds are dominated by the gluon GFF of the pion to next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. We predict cross sections for the Electron-Ion Collider and the Jefferson Lab experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact colour evolution for jet observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis of sub-leading colour corrections in perturbative QCD processes involving multiple soft gluon emissions. This necessitates going beyond the standard parton shower paradigm in order to incorporate interference effects and is accomplished using the CVolver program, which simulates parton showers at the amplitude level. We can compute cross-sections with full-colour precision and also broken down explicitly in terms of their $N_c$ dependence. In this paper, we focus on the jet cross-section with a veto of additional jets in some fixed region of phase-space, since this is sensitive to wide-angle, soft gluon radiation. We consider $Z \to q \bar{q}$, $H \to gg$, $q\bar{q} \to q\bar{q}$, $qg \to qg$, $gg \to gg$ and $ZZ \to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}$. We find that non-trivial sub-leading colour effects are generally important at the 5 -- 30\% level and much more than this for certain interference contributions. Remarkably, for this observable, we find that for all of the $t$-channel gluon exchange processes that we consider, the strictly leading colour approximation, which includes the replacement $C_F \to C_A/2$, is an excellent approximation to the full colour result (up to an overall colour factor).</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models with axion like particles (ALPs) often predict the formation of a string-domain wall network in the early universe. We study how such networks of defects appear in the context of string theory, and discuss the conditions for their long-term stability. In a scenario with several axions, we show how a bias term in the potential arises naturally from the effects of multiple instantons, leading to the eventual decay of the domain walls. We find that the annihilation of the network leads to the generation of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) with a spectrum that has characteristic contributions from both walls and strings. The unique shape of the spectrum provides an opportunity to probe string theory axions at existing and upcoming observatories. The extinction of the network is also accompanied by the production of different axion mass eigenstates. In a region of the parameter space, the lightest eigenstate can be long lived and make up the dark matter in the universe.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the von Laue Condition: Implications for the On-Shell Lagrangian of Particles and Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the von Laue condition, the volume integral of the proper pressure inside isolated particles with a fixed structure and finite mass vanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. In this work, we consider a simple illustrative example: non-standard static global monopoles with finite energy, for which the von Laue condition is satisfied when the proper pressure is integrated over the whole space. We demonstrate, however, that the absolute value of this integral, when calculated up to a finite distance from the center of the global monopole, generally deviates from zero, and that this deviation is bounded by the energy located outside the specified volume (under the assumption of the dominant energy condition). Furthermore, we find that the maximum deviation from unity of the ratio between the volume averages of the on-shell Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot exceed three times the outer energy fraction. Additionally, we show that, as long as the dominant energy condition holds, these constraints generally apply to real particles with fixed structure and finite mass. We discuss the implications of this result in the context of stable atomic nuclei. Specifically, we argue that, except in extremely dense environments with energy densities comparable to that of an atomic nucleus (e.g., inside neutron stars), the volume average of the aforementioned ratio for atomic nuclei should remain extremely close to unity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of real fluids. This is often a crucial element for accurately describing fluid dynamics in the presence of non-minimal couplings to other matter fields or gravity.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation model into the NEUT event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the implementation of a model for charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering in the NEUT Monte Carlo event generator. This model employs relativistic momentum distributions obtained from mean field theory and relativistic distorted waves to describe the initial and final nucleon states. Final state interactions, both elastic and inelastic, are modelled by combining distorted waves with the NEUT intranuclear cascade, offering a more accurate representation of the interactions experienced by scattered nucleons. The model and its implementation in NEUT are described in detail and benchmarked against $\nu_{\mu}$-$^{12}$C scattering cross-section measurements from T2K and MINER$\nu$A, as well as $\nu_{\mu}$-$^{40}$Ar measurements from MicroBooNE. Results, including transverse kinematic imbalance variables and scattered nucleon kinematics, show improved $\chi^2$ values compared to other CCQE models in NEUT. Furthermore, the model consistently predicts lower cross sections in CCQE-dominated regions, indicating potential for further refinement, such as incorporating two-body currents or the use of more advanced nucleon axial form factors consistent with lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complicated time-dependent curved spacetime and electric field are involved in many astrophysical situations, including the early universe, Hawking radiation, the Schwinger effect, and gravitational pair production. In this Letter, a generalized quantum two-level model (GQTLM) is developed, which is applicable to arbitrary time-dependent curved spacetime and electric field. The model is found to be consistent with quantum kinetic theory, and is characterized by its simplicity and versatility. The momentum distribution of particles and the effects of gravitational distortions can be correctly described. Quantum properties concerning vortex structures, such as the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of particles and antiparticles can also be conveniently calculated. The model is expected to significantly advance the quantum exploration of the universe. It could refine the prediction of primordial gravitational waves and relevant non-Gaussian signals, extend the calculation of Hawking radiation to general black hole configurations, help to distinguish neutron stars from strange quark stars, and elucidate the gravitational pair production mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of the quark transverse spin-momentum correlation, i.e., the naive time-reversal-odd Boer-Mulders function, of the nucleon, using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). The calculation is carried out on an ensemble with lattice spacing $a=0.098$ fm and pion mass $338$ MeV, at various proton momenta up to $2.11$ GeV. We have implemented perturbative matching up to the next-to-next-to-leading order together with a renormalization-group resummation improvement. The result exhibits a decay behavior with increasing transverse separation $b_\perp$. We also compare the results in the nucleon and pion.</description>

      <title>The sinusoidal valley: a recipe for high peaks in the scalar and induced tensor spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adding a sine-type interaction to inflationary models with two fields can evoke a classical trajectory with many turns in field space. Under conditions we discuss, the enhancement of the spectrum of adiabatic fluctuations resulting from each turn adds up. A special range of scales away from the CMB-constrained region can then be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, allowing for interesting phenomenological possibilities, such as induced gravitational waves or primordial black holes. A localized version of this interaction can also be used as an add-on to conventional inflationary models, thus allowing the injection of the large peak in their power spectra. The intuition and the conclusions drawn from this simple model remain relevant for more complicated applications that usually include extra terms that obscure the simplicity of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter fails to explain the dark matter cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafaint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are ideal for studying dark matter (DM) due to minimal baryonic effects. UFD observations suggest cored DM profiles. We find that the core radius -- stellar mass scaling predicted by fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is at $6.1\sigma$ tension with UFD observations. Combining observations from 27 UFDs, the required FDM mass $m_a = 3.2_{-0.6}^{+0.8}\times 10^{-21}\,{\rm eV}$ is also in conflict with existing Lyman-$\alpha$ bounds. Our results suggest that FDM cannot provide a consistent explanation for DM cores and imply $m_a &gt; 2.2\times 10^{-21}\,{\rm eV}$ at to $2\sigma$ CL.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Study of Pion Electroproduction and Weak Production from a Nucleon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in QCD influence nucleon structure and interactions, with pion production serving as a key probe of chiral dynamics. In this study, we present a lattice QCD calculation of multipole amplitudes at threshold, related to both pion electroproduction and weak production from a nucleon, using two gauge ensembles near the physical pion mass. We develop a technique for spin projection and construct multiple operators for analyzing the generalized eigenvalue problem in both the nucleon-pion system in the center-of-mass frame and the nucleon system with nonzero momentum. The numerical lattice results are then compared with those extracted from experimental data and predicted by low-energy theorems incorporating one-loop corrections.</description>

      <title>The role of the counterterms in the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, several papers have claimed that superhorizon curvature perturbations are not conserved at the one-loop level in single-field inflation models if there is a transient ultra-slow-roll period. In this work, we point out that the contributions from the counterterms were overlooked in the recent papers. We show that the counterterm contributions play a crucial role in canceling the one-loop power spectrum of superhorizon curvature perturbations in the comoving gauge.</description>

      <title>Boosted Top Tagging through Flavour-violating interactions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes a method for detecting a rare top quark decay into a charm quark and a Higgs boson (H), which decays further into b quarks, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and introduces a tagging algorithm to identify boosted tops using large-R jets containing b- and c-tagged elements. We consider the associated production of the top quark with a W-boson and identify different observables to discriminate the signal from the Standard Model (SM) background events. Although our model with improved jet substructure methods outperforms existing approaches to tag such rare decay tops, the improvement in the New Physics reach in terms of $t \to cH$ branching ratio is marginal, even at the high luminosity run of LHC, compared to the existing limits from the LHC 13 TeV data. Although the result seems negative from the point of view of BSM reach, it is significant enough to motivate further studies in the search for the rare top decays at future colliders with higher energy and luminosity. Additionally, the paper utilizes SHAP, a Game Theory-based method, to analyze the contribution of each observable to the classification of events, offering valuable insights into the classifier. The approach presented in this paper is robust in scope and can be effectively implemented for similar probes of physics beyond the SM.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermal freeze-out of a dark photon dark matter in the so-called dark-axion portal - a triple coupling among a dark photon, an axion-like particle and the SM $\gamma$ or $Z$ boson. We analyze in detail the thermal production regimes: coscattering (aka conversion driven freeze-out), mediator freeze-out, and coannihilations. We found viable DM scenarios fulfilling the correct relic abundance in the three regimes. Apart of analyzing the parameter space for dark state masses between the GeV-TeV scale, we explore the prospects of having the axion-like field as a long-lived particle, possibly to be observed at the LHC and future detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming that the number densities of heavy flavor in hadron gas and in QGP are same at $T_c$, we obtain the effective mass of heavy quark at $T_c$ from the comparison with the hadron resonance gas model which well describes particle yield in heavy-ion collisions. We find that charm quark mass at vanishing baryon chemical potential is around 1.8 GeV which is much heavier than QCD bare mass and close to $D$ meson mass. The mass slightly increases with increasing baryon chemical potential and then decreases. On the other hand, anticharm quark mass constantly decreases with increasing baryon chemical potential. Bottom quark mass has a similar pattern. Extending the hadron resonance gas model to a bit higher temperature beyond $T_c$, the effective masses of charm and bottom quarks decrease with increasing temperature.</description>

      <title>Probing $|V_{td}|$ in single-top production at $pe^{\mp}$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the consequences for top-quark physics of having electron and positron beams available at the LHeC and FCC-he, as was the case in HERA. We show that the asymmetry between top production in $pe^+$ collisions and antitop production in $pe^-$ reactions is sensitive to $|V_{td}|$. By means of detailed parton-level Monte Carlo simulations of single $t$ and $\bar{t}$ production and its backgrounds, we parametrize the asymmetry dependence on $|V_{td}|$ and estimate its uncertainties. Our analysis includes realistic phase-space cuts, and machine-learning binary classifiers for background rejection. We thus obtain limits on $|V_{td}|$ that are substantially stronger than current ones, and also smaller than current projections for the HL-LHC. We have $|V_{td}| &lt; 1.6\times |V_{td}^\mathrm{PDG}|$ at the LHeC, at 68\% C.L.\ with $L_\mathrm{int}=2$/ab.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}&gt; 10^{-300}$. Interestingly, our findings suggest that PBHs within the xSM framework may align with observations of the six ultrashort timescale events reported by the OGLE microlensing experiment.</description>

      <title>Jet Definition and Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Factorization in Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the colour dipole picture of Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) and the Colour Glass Condensate effective theory, we study semi-inclusive jet production in DIS at small $x$ in the limit where the photon virtuality $Q^2$ is much larger than the transverse momentum squared $P_\perp^2$ of the produced jet. In this limit, the cross-section is dominated by aligned jet configurations, that is, quark-antiquark pairs in which one of the fermions -- the would-be struck quark in the Breit frame -- carries most of the longitudinal momentum of the virtual photon. We show that physically meaningful jet definitions in DIS are such that the effective axis of the jet sourced by the struck quark is controlled by its virtuality rather than by its transverse momentum. For such jet definitions, we show that the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-section admits factorisation in terms of the (sea) quark transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distribution, which in turn satisfies a universal Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi and Sudakov evolution.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a relative P-wave to construct the vector doubly-charm diquark $(\widetilde{V})$, therefore, the scalar and tensor four-quark currents to investigate the decay widths of the fully-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ via the QCD sum rules. We observe that the total width of the ground state $\widetilde{V}\overline{\widetilde{V}}$-type scalar tetraquark state is compatible with that of the $X(6552)$ within the uncertainties, and the branching ratios are quite different from that of the first radial excitation of the $A\bar{A}$-type scalar tetraquark state. Other predictions can be verified in the future experiments to shed light on the nature of the fully-charm tetraquark states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on a type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold has been enumerated consisting of 33 independent models with distinct gauge coupling relations at the string scale. Here, we study the phenomenology of all such models by providing the detailed particle spectra and the analysis of the possible 3-point and the 4-point Yukawa interactions in order to accommodate all standard-model fermion masses and mixings. We find that only 17 models contain viable Yukawa textures to explain quarks masses, charged-leptons' masses, neutrino-masses, quarks' mixings and leptons' mixings. These viable models split into four classes, viz. a single model with 3 Higgs fields from the bulk and sixteen models with either 6, 9 or 12 Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector. The models perform successively better with the increasing number of Higgs pairs. Remarkably, the class of models with 12 Higgs naturally predicts the Dirac-type neutrino masses in normal ordering consistent with both the experimental constraints as well as the bounds from the swampland program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An intriguing and important question arises: how do hadronic molecules interact with conventional hadrons? In this work, we propose a novel mechanism to address this issue, focusing on the interactions between hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks ($P_c$) and nucleons ($N$). By applying this mechanism, we derive the corresponding interaction potentials, enabling the prediction of the bound state properties. Our results indicate the possible existence of $P_cN$ bound states-an entirely new form of matter, ripe for exploration in the era of high-precision hadron spectroscopy. Notably, this mechanism extends beyond the $P_cN$ systems and can be applied to any hadronic molecules interacting with conventional hadrons, offering the potential for discovering a variety of novel bound states.</description>

Abstract: We study the influence of a rotation on the string tension and the temperature of the confinement-deconfinement transition of gluodynamics by gauge/gravity duality. We explore two distinct approaches, global transformation and local transformation, to introduce rotation and compare the results. It is shown that the string tension extracted from the free energy in the presence of a heavy quarkonium decreases with the increasing angular velocity, while the transition temperature determined by the Polyakov loop increases with increasing angular velocity, which is in line with lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The indirect production mechanisms of doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$ through three decay channels, Higgs$/Z^{0}\to \langle cc\rangle_{\bar{3}} +\bar{c}+\bar{c} \to T_{cc}^{\bar{q}\bar{q^{\prime}}} +\bar{c}+\bar{c} $ and $W^+\to \langle cc\rangle_{\bar{3}}+\bar{c}+\bar{s} \to T_{cc}^{\bar{q}\bar{q^{\prime}}} +\bar{c}+\bar{s} $, are analyzed within the framework of nonrelativistic QCD. The intermediate $\langle cc\rangle_{\bar{3}}$ diquark cluster in color antitriplet evolves into tetraquark components via the fragmentation process by trapping two light antiquarks ($\bar{q}$ and $\bar{q^{\prime}}$) from the vacuum. After the considered doubly charmed tetraquark components are summed, including $T_{cc}^{\bar{u} \bar{u}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{u} \bar{d}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{d} \bar{d}}$, $T_{cc}^{\bar{u}\bar{s}}$, and $T_{cc}^{\bar{d}\bar{s}}$, the decay widths, branching ratios, and produced events each year for the production of $T_{cc}$ can be predicted at LHC and CEPC, respectively. The differential distributions and two main sources of theoretical uncertainty are also discussed. The results show that the produced events each year for $T_{cc}$ via $W^{+}$ decays is $1.80\times10^5$, nearly $2$ orders of magnitude larger than that by Higgs decays ($1.11\times10^{3}$) and $Z^{0}$ decays ($4.81\times10^3$) at LHC. However at CEPC, the largest contribution for the production of $T_{cc}$ is through $Z^{0}$ decays, about $1.63\times10^6$. There are only $4.79\times10^{-1}$ and $2.03\times10^{2}$ $T_{cc}$ events produced each year at CEPC through Higgs and $W^+$ decay, respectively.</description>

      <title>On Extracting Thermal Parameters and Scenario in High-Energy Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this minireview article, we examine the inconsistent results of thermal parameters derived from various models in high-energy collisions. Through a comprehensive literature review and based on the average transverse momentum or the root-mean-square transverse momentum, we propose model-independent parameters to address these inconsistencies. The relevant parameters include: the initial temperature, the effective temperature, the kinetic freeze-out temperature, and the average transverse velocity. Our findings indicate that these four parameters are larger in central collisions, within central rapidity regions, at higher energies, and in larger collision systems. As collision energy increases, excitation functions for all four parameters rise rapidly (slowly) within ranges below (above) approximately 7.7 GeV. At higher energies (&gt;39) GeV, fluctuations occur in trends for these excitation functions, with only slight changes observed in their growth rates. Additionally, this work reveals a mass-dependent multi-temperature scenario pertaining to both initial states and kinetic freeze-out processes.</description>

      <title>Elastic Dijet Production in Electron Scattering on a Longitudinally Polarized Proton at Small $x$: A Portal to Orbital Angular Momentum Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the elastic production of dijets from electron collisions with a longitudinally polarized proton target at small values of the Bjorken $x$ variable. Building on the pioneering proposals of \cite{Hatta:2016aoc,Bhattacharya:2022vvo, Bhattacharya:2023hbq, Bhattacharya:2024sck} for measuring the quark and gluon orbital angular momentum (OAM) distributions, our focus is on both the longitudinal double spin asymmetry (DSA) and longitudinal single spin asymmetry (SSA). We compute the numerators of these asymmetries in the small-$x$ formalism of the light-cone operator treatment. Utilizing the small-$x$ expressions for the OAM distributions derived in our earlier paper, we demonstrate that the DSA provides a robust probe for both the quark and gluon OAM distributions within the proton. In contrast, we find that while the SSA is also sensitive to the OAM distributions, extraction of the latter from the SSA would require new developments in small-$x$ theory and phenomenology, and is probably not feasible at this point in time. These findings highlight the potential of DSA measurements in elastic dijet production at the future Electron-Ion Collider to provide the first-ever direct access to the quark and gluon OAM distributions at small $x$, paving the way for new insights into the proton spin puzzle.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective theory of scalar and vector diquarks revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral effective theory of light diquarks is revisited. We construct an effective Lagrangian based on the linear representation of three-flavor chiral symmetry. Here, we focus on the effect of a chiral and $U(1)_A$ symmetric term originated from an eight-point quark interaction. From this model, we obtain the mass formulas of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector diquarks, which also describe the dependence of diquark masses on the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and the $U(1)_A$ anomaly. We regard singly heavy baryons as two-body systems composed of one heavy quark and one diquark and then predict the fate of the mass spectrum and the strong decay widths under chiral symmetry restoration.</description>

      <title>Coherent Axion Production through Laser Crystal Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between an optical laser and an ionic crystal and reveal coherent emission of axions through phase-match between laser and axion fields. Such emission is further enhanced by stacking thin crystal layers of half-wavelength thickness. Based on these findings, we propose a novel method for generating and detecting axions in terrestrial experiments, achieving up to a two-order-of-magnitude increase in transition probability compared to light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments with the same interaction region size. For an experimental length of 10 meters, this setup could lower the exclusion limit to $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim1.32\times10^{-11}\textrm{GeV}^{-1}$ with currently available laser technologies.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the intrinsic transversal momentum distributions of pion and kaon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to introduce the intrinsic transversal momentum distribution functions (iTMDs), in conjunction with the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), to elucidate the probability amplitude of encountering a meson state wherein the partons swiftly traverse along the longitudinal axis while gently oscillating in the transversal plane. The primary motivation stems from the oversight of soft transverse dynamics within the $k_T$ factorization formalism of an exclusive QCD process, which confines perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to scenarios involving large momentum transfers. We meticulously investigate the $\pi$ and $K$ electromagnetic form factors using the iTMDs-improved pQCD calculation at next-to-leading order. By analyzing data in the timelike physical regions, we obtain the transversal-size parameters $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^2$. We then extract the chiral mass of pion to be $m_0^\pi(1 \, {\rm GeV}) = 1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV and explain the precise measurements of kaon form factor in the perturbative timelike region. As a remarkable byproduct, we found that the incorporation of iTMDs improves the pQCD predictions for electromagnetic form factors, extending their accuracy to the range of a few GeV$^2$. This improvement allows for direct comparison with existing measurements and lattice QCD evaluations.</description>

      <title>A simple way to reduce the number of contours in the multi-fold Mellin-Barnes integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop off-shell box massless diagram is five-fold by construction. On the other hand, it is known from the year 1992 that it may be reduced to certain two-fold Mellin-Barnes integral. We propose a way to reduce the number of the Mellin-Barnes integration contours from five to two by using the Mellin-Barnes integral representation only in combination with basic methods of mathematical analysis such as analytical regularization. We do not use any Barnes lemma to prove the reduction but we use the integral Cauchy formula instead. We recover first the well-known two-fold Mellin-Barnes representation for the one-loop triangle massless diagram and then show how the five-fold Mellin-Barnes integral representation of one-loop box diagram with all the indices 1 in four spacetime dimensions may be reduced to the two-fold Mellin-Barnes representation for one-loop triangle diagram. Singular integrals over Feynman parameters appear in the integrand of the five-fold Mellin-Barnes integral representation at the intermediate step. Such integrals should be treated as distributions with respect to certain linear combinations of the initial Mellin-Barnes integration variables in the Mellin-Barnes integrands. These distributions may be integrated out with a finite number of residues in the limit of removing the analytical regularization. We explain how to apply this strategy to an arbitrary Feynman diagram in order to reduce the number of Mellin-Barnes integration contours. On the practical side, we analyze connections between the obtained results and the knot theory, Trotter integrals, quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Correction to the Magnetic Moment of the Charged Lepton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general Hamiltonian expression, up to the first-order relativistic correction, was derived by breaking the four-component Dirac equation into the two-component Dirac-Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian incorporates the first-order relativistic correction to the electromagnetic interaction with the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the charged lepton, distinguishing it from other generic Hamiltonians. The first-order relativistic adjustment to the Land\'e g-factor, or equivalently to the magnetic moment, was calculated using this generalized Hamiltonian for hydrogen-like atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. It turns out that when we impose specific states, the formulations found in the literature match this relativistic correction. Furthermore, we have shown that the relativistic effect-induced energy shift of order $\alpha^2$ depends on the square of the azimuthal quantum number $m_j^2$, as well as on both the principal and total quantum numbers, denoted respectively by $n$ and $j$. This is in contrast to the case in the absence of an external magnetic field, where the energy shift depends only on $n$.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Secluded and Catalyzed Annihilation Dark Matter with Fermi-LAT and Planck Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dark matter (DM) model with a complex scalar charged under a hidden gauge symmetry, denoted as $U(1)_D$. The scalar field is the DM candidate while the $U(1)_D$ gauge field $A'$ plays the role of a mediator, which connects the dark sector to the standard model (SM) sector via a tiny kinetic mixing. We find that both the secluded and catalyzed annihilation scenarios can be realized in this model. The phenomenology of DM, including relic density, indirect detection (Fermi-LAT), and CMB (Planck) constraints, is discussed. We also extend our discussion to DM with other spins, including Dirac fermion and vector boson. Our analysis is carried out in two models, denoted as $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, with the former corresponding to $A'$ kinetically mixing with the $U(1)_Y$ gauge field $B$ and the latter corresponding to $A'$ mixing with the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge field $Z'$. We find that, in previous studies, the indirect detection limits were overly restrictive because they only considered the simplified $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2\mathrm{SM}$ annihilation channel. In contrast, by performing a complete calculation of the gamma-ray and CMB constraints from the process $2\mathrm{DM} \to 2A' \to 4\mathrm{SM}$ in the models we consider, we observe weaker constraints in both the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ models, with the $U(1)_D \times U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model being subject to the weakest constraints overall since it involves less hadronic decay processes.</description>

      <title>Decays of the light hybrid meson $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full width of the light isovector hybrid meson $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ with spin-parities $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$ and content $(\overline{u}gu-\overline{d}gd)/ \sqrt{2}$ is evaluated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $b_1^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $f_1(1285)\pi$, $f_1(1420)\pi$, $ \eta \pi$, and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$. To calculate the partial widths of these channels, we use QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to determine strong couplings at the corresponding hybrid-meson-meson vertices. It turns out that the main contribution to the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{ V}}]=(109.7 \pm 16.0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ of the hybrid meson comes from the processes $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ partial width of which amounts to $\approx 67~\mathrm{MeV}$. The effects of the decays $H_{\mathrm{V }} \to b_1\pi $ and $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to f_1\pi, f_1^{\prime} \pi$ are also sizeable: Their partial widths are equal to $13~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $20~ \mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. The decays to $\eta \pi$ and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$ mesons are subdominant reactions, nevertheless they form $\approx 9\%$ of the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{V}}]$. Results obtained in this work may be interesting to unravel the tangle of predictions about $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ existing in the literature, as well as useful in analyses of different resonances.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Global Axion Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking scenario provides a unique opportunity to pinpoint the QCD axion dark matter mass, which is a crucial input for laboratory experiments that are designed for probing specific mass ranges. Predicting their mass requires a precise knowledge of how axions are produced from the decay of topological defects in the early Universe that are inevitably formed.
  In this contribution, we present recent results on the analysis of the spectrum of axions radiated from global strings based on large scale numerical simulations of the cosmological evolution of the PQ field on a static lattice.
  We highlight several systematic effects that have been overlooked in previous works, such as the dependence on the initial conditions, contaminations due to oscillations in the spectrum, and discretisation effects; some of which could explain the discrepancy in the current literature.
  Taking these uncertainties into account and performing the extrapolation to cosmologically relevant string tensions, we find that the dark matter mass is predicted to be in the range of $95\,\mu\text{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 450 \, \mu\text{eV}$, which will be probed by some of the next generation direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>SymTFT for (3+1)d Gapless SPTs and Obstructions to Confinement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gapless phases in (3+1)d in the presence of 1-form and non-invertible duality symmetries. Using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach, we classify the gapless symmetry-protected (gSPT) phases in these setups, with particular focus on intrinsically gSPTs (igSPTs). These are symmetry protected critical points which cannot be deformed to a trivially gapped phase without spontaneously breaking the symmetry. Although these are by now well-known in (1+1)d, we demonstrate their existence in (3+1)d gauge theories. Here, they have a clear physical interpretation in terms of an obstruction to confinement, even though the full 1-form symmetry does not suffer from 't Hooft anomalies. These igSPT phases provide a new way to realize 1-form symmetries in CFTs, that has no analog for gapped phases. The SymTFT approach allows for a direct generalization from invertible symmetries to non-invertible duality symmetries, for which we study gSPT and igSPT phases as well. We accompany these theoretical results with concrete physical examples realizing such phases and explain how obstruction to confinement is detected at the level of symmetric deformations.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Higher-order gaugino condensates on a twisted $\mathbb T^4$: In the beginning was semi-classics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the gaugino condensates, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle $ for $1$ $\leq$ $k$ $\le$ $N-1$, in $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory on a small four-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^4$, subject to 't Hooft twisted boundary conditions. Two recent advances are crucial to performing the calculations and interpreting the result: the understanding of generalized anomalies involving $1$-form center symmetry and the construction of multi-fractional instantons on the twisted $\mathbb T^4$. These self-dual classical configurations have topological charge $k/N$ and can be described as a sum over $k$ closely packed lumps in an instanton liquid. Using the path integral formalism, we perform the condensate calculations in the semi-classical limit and find, assuming gcd$(k,N)=1$, $\left\langle \prod_{i=1}^k \text{tr}(\lambda\lambda)(x_i) \right\rangle = {\bf n}^{-1} \; N^2\left(16\pi^2 \Lambda^3\right)^k$, where $\Lambda$ is the strong-coupling scale and ${\bf n}$ is a normalization constant. We determine the normalization constant, using path integral, as ${\bf n} = N^2$, which is $N$ times larger than the normalization used in our earlier publication arXiv:2210.13568. This finding resolves the extra-factor-of-$N$ discrepancy encountered there, aligning our results with those obtained through direct supersymmetric methods on $\mathbb R^4$. The normalization constant ${\bf n}$ can be understood within the Euclidean path-integral framework as the Witten index $I_W$. From the Hamiltonian approach, it is well-established that $I_W = N$. While the value ${\bf n} = N^2$ correctly reproduces the condensate result, this discrepancy between the Hamiltonian and path-integral formulations calls for reconciliation. We attempt to provide a potential solution we outline in our discussion.</description>

Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves from graviton bremsstrahlung by the decay of inflaton: case with polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary universe, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main reheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions (spin $\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body decays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a graviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial exponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a collection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently oscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with energies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for the production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential exponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's oscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead consist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a result, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less pronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence of the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter particles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the GHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these signals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Dark universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with massive spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the present paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a minimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Interference in Fuzzy Dark Matter Filaments: Idealised Models and Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fuzzy (wave) dark matter (FDM), the dynamical model underlying an ultralight bosonic dark matter species, produces a rich set of non-gravitational signatures that distinguishes it markedly from the phenomenologically related warm (particle) dark matter (WDM) scenario. The emergence of extended interference fringes hosted by cosmic filaments is one such phenomenon reported by cosmological simulations, and a detailed understanding of such may strengthen existing limits on the boson mass but also break the degeneracy with WDM, and provide a unique fingerprint of interference in cosmology. In this paper, we provide initial steps towards this goal. In particular, we show in a bottom-up approach, how the presence of interference in an idealised filament population can lead to a non-suppressive feature in the matter power spectrum -- an observation supported by fully-cosmological FDM simulations. To this end, we build on a theoretically motivated and numerically observed steady-state approximation for filaments and express the equilibrium dynamics of such in an expansion of FDM eigenstates. We optimise the size of the expansion by incorporating classical phase-space information. Ellipsoidal collapse considerations are used to construct a fuzzy filament mass function which, together with the reconstructed FDM wave function, allow us to efficiently compute the one-filament power spectrum. We showcase our non-perturbative interference model for a selection of boson masses and confirm our approach is able to produce the matter power boost observed in fully-cosmological FDM simulations. More precisely, we find an excess in correlation between the spatial scale associated with the FDM ground state and the quantum pressure scale. We speculate about applications of this effect in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations at one loop: Backreaction in the in-in formalism and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>
