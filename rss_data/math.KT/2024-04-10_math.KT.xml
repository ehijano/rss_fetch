      <title>K-theories and Free Inductive Graded Rings in Abstract Quadratic Forms Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build on previous work on multirings (\cite{roberto2021quadratic}) that provides generalizations of the available abstract quadratic forms theories (special groups and real semigroups) to the context of multirings (\cite{marshall2006real}, \cite{ribeiro2016functorial}). Here we raise one step in this generalization, introducing the concept of pre-special hyperfields and expand a fundamental tool in quadratic forms theory to the more general multivalued setting: the K-theory. We introduce and develop the K-theory of hyperbolic hyperfields that generalize simultaneously Milnor's K-theory (\cite{milnor1970algebraick}) and Special Groups K-theory, developed by Dickmann-Miraglia (\cite{dickmann2006algebraic}). We develop some properties of this generalized K-theory, that can be seen as a free inductive graded ring, a concept introduced in \cite{dickmann1998quadratic} in order to provide a solution of Marshall's Signature Conjecture.</description>

      <title>On the Goncharov's conjecture in degree $m-1$ and weight $m$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb K$ be a field of characteristic zero. We prove that its motivic cohomology in degree $m-1$ and weight $m$ is rationally isomorphic to the cohomology of the polylogarithmic complex. This gives a partial extension of A. Suslin theorem describing the indecomposable $K_3$ of a field.</description>

      <title>Index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the index theory of hypoelliptic operators on Carnot manifolds -- manifolds whose Lie algebra of vector fields is equipped with a filtration induced from sub-bundles of the tangent bundle. A Heisenberg pseudodifferential operator, elliptic in the calculus of van Erp-Yuncken, is hypoelliptic and Fredholm. Under some geometric conditions, we compute its Fredholm index by means of operator $K$-theory. These results extend the work of Baum-van Erp (Acta Mathematica '2014) for co-oriented contact manifolds to a methodology for solving this index problem geometrically on Carnot manifolds.
  Under the assumption that the Carnot manifold is regular, i.e. has isomorphic osculating Lie algebras in all fibres, and admits a flat coadjoint orbit, the methodology derived from Baum-van Erp's work is developed in full detail. In this case, we develope $K$-theoretical dualities computing the Fredholm index by means of geometric $K$-homology a la Baum-Douglas. The duality involves a Hilbert space bundle of flat orbit representations. Explicit solutions to the index problem for Toeplitz operators and operators of the form "$\Delta_H+\gamma T$" are computed in geometric $K$-homology, extending results of Boutet de Monvel and Baum-van Erp, respectively, from co-oriented contact manifolds to regular polycontact manifolds.</description>

      <title>Motivic Gauss and Jacobi sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Gauss and Jacobi sums from a viewpoint of motives. We exhibit isomorphisms between Chow motives arising from the Artin-Schreier curve and the Fermat varieties over a finite field, that can be regarded as (and yield a new proof of) classically known relations among Gauss and Jacobi sums such as Davenport-Hasse's multiplication formula. As a key step, we define motivic analogues of the Gauss and Jacobi sums as algebraic correspondences, and show that they represent the Frobenius endomorphisms of such motives. This generalizes Coleman's result for curves. These results are applied to investigate the group of invertible Chow motives with coefficients in a cyclotomic field.</description>

      <title>On the logarithmic slice filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider slice filtrations in logarithmic motivic homotopy theory. Our main results establish conjectured compatibilities with the Beilinson, BMS, and HKR filtrations on (topological, log) Hochschild homology and related invariants. In the case of perfect fields admitting resolution of singularities, we show that the slice filtration realizes the BMS filtration on the $p$-completed topological cyclic homology. Furthermore, the motivic trace map is compatible with the slice and BMS filtrations, yielding a natural morphism from the motivic slice spectral sequence to the BMS spectral sequence. Finally, we consider the Kummer \'etale hypersheafification of logarithmic $K$-theory and show that its very effective slices compute Lichtenbaum \'etale motivic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Modularity of higher theta series II: Chow group of the generic fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher theta series on moduli spaces of Hermitian shtukas were constructed by Feng--Yun--Zhang and conjectured to be modular, parallel to classical conjectures in the Kudla program. In this paper we prove the modularity of higher theta series after restriction to the generic locus. The proof is an upgrade, using motivic homotopy theory, of earlier work of Feng--Yun--Zhang which established generic modularity of $\ell$-adic realizations. In the process, we develop some general tools of broader utility. One such is the "motivic sheaf-cycle correspondence", a categorical trace formalism for extracting computations in the Chow group from computations in Voevodsky's derived category of motives. Another new tool is the "derived homogeneous Fourier transform", which we use to implement a form of Fourier analysis for motives.</description>
