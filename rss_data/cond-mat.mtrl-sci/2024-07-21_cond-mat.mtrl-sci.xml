      <title>Unraveling nano-scale effects of topotactic reduction in LaNiO$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelates stand as a promising frontier in the exploration of unconventional superconductivity. Their synthesis through topotactic oxygen reduction from the parent perovskite phase remains a complex and elusive process. This study delves into the nano-scale effects of the topotactic lattice transformation within LaNiO$_2$ crystals. Leveraging high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy, our investigations uncover a panorama of structural alterations, including grain boundaries and coherent twin boundaries, triggered by reduction-induced transformations. In addition, our analyses unveil the formation of an oxygen-rich disordered transition phase encircling impurities and pervading crystalline domains, and the internal strain is accommodated by grain boundary formation. By unraveling these nano-scale effects, our findings provide insights into the microscopic intricacies of the topotactic reduction process elucidating the transition from the perovskite to the infinite-layer phase within nickelate bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Development of an Atomic Cluster Expansion potential for iron and its oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined structural and electronic complexity of iron oxides poses many challenges to atomistic modeling. To leverage limitations in terms of the accessible length and time scales, one requires a physically justified interatomic potential which is accurate to correctly account for the complexity of iron-oxygen systems. Such a potential is not yet available in the literature. In this work, we propose a machine-learning potential based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion for modeling the iron-oxygen system, which explicitly accounts for magnetism. We test the potential on a wide range of properties of iron and its oxides, and demonstrate its ability to describe the thermodynamics of systems spanning the whole range of oxygen content and including magnetic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Excitation laser energy dependence of the gap-mode TERS spectra of WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ on silver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the dependence of gap mode tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) of mono- and bi-layer WS$_2$ and MoS$_2$ as a function of excitation laser energy. We collected consecutive TERS maps of mono-and bi-layer regions with 6 different excitation lasers. To decrease the acquisition time, we used for the first time concurrent excitation and collection with two lasers simultaneously. We found that the E$_{2g}$/A$_{1g}$ peak intensity ratio for bilayer WS$_2$@Ag and the A'/A$_{1g}$ peak intensity ratio of the out-of-plane modes for mono- and bilayer change in a significantly non-monotonous way with excitation laser energies from 1.58 to 2.62 eV. The former ratio increases at energies corresponding to A and B excitons in bilayer WS$_2$. The intensity of the A peak in the monolayer, and hence the A/A$_{1g}$ ratio, is surprisingly high at low excitation energies, dips dramatically at energy corresponding to the A exciton, and is restored partially in between A and B excitons, though still showing a descending trend with increasing energy. A similar picture was observed in mono- and bi-layer MoS$_2$, though the existing set of lasers did not match its excitonic profile as nicely as for WS$_2$. We attribute the observed behavior to intermediate (Fano resonance) or strong (Rabi splitting) coupling between the excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and the plasmons in the tip-substrate nanocavity. This is akin to the so-called Fano (Rabi) transparency experimentally observed in far field scattering from TMDs between two plasmonic metals. The possibility of intermediate/strong coupling between excitonic resonances in TMDs and the nanocavity re-evaluates the role of resonances in gap-mode TERS and should become an important factor to be considered by TERS practitioners when planning experiments. Finally, we propose the ideal substrate for efficient TERS and tip enhanced photoluminescence measurements.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Representation of Configuration-Dependent Friction Tensors in Langevin Heatbaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of coarse-grained particle systems derived via the Mori-Zwanzig projection formalism commonly take the form of a (generalized) Langevin equation with configuration-dependent friction and diffusion tensors. In this article, we introduce a class of equivariant representations of tensor-valued functions based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework that allows for efficient learning of such configuration-dependent friction and diffusion tensors from data. Besides satisfying the correct equivariance properties with respect to the Euclidean group E(3), the resulting heat bath models satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Moreover, our models can be extended to include additional symmetries, such as momentum conservation, to preserve the hydrodynamic properties of the particle system. We demonstrate the capabilities of the model by constructing a model of configuration-dependent tensorial electronic friction calculated from first principles that arises during reactive molecular dynamics at metal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cluster Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer Quasi-Hexagonal C60</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions. Since chemical bonds between atoms of the same elements favor centrosymmetric crystal structures and symmetrically distributed electron charges, elemental ferroelectrics are extremely rare. In comparison to atoms, elemental clusters are less symmetric and typically have various preferred orientations in crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. Based on this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C60, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Trilayer qHP C60's have several stable polar structures, which are distinguishable in second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Compared to previously found elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C60's have sizable band gaps and some of them have both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations. Remarkably, the out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations are decoupled, enabling an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian fluctuations of quantum anharmonic nuclei. The case of rotational degrees of freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic motion in molecular crystals, such as high-pressure hydrogen or hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, is very complex due to quantum anharmonic effects. In addition, these materials accommodate rotational degrees of freedom. All the approximate methods that describe the nuclei thermodynamics using Cartesian coordinates lead to an unphysical hybridization of roto-librations with other high-energy modes. Hence, they do not accurately account for the free energy contributions of these degrees of freedom. So, a reliable description of a molecular crystal's phase diagram is only possible with Path Integral Molecular Dynamics (PIMD) at a high computational cost. This work shows how to include roto-librational modes in the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) framework. SCHA approximates the nuclei Cartesian fluctuations to be Gaussian, thus neglecting curvilinear motion. Keeping its low computational cost, we employ the generalization of SCHA, called nonlinear SCHA (NLSCHA). Our method relies on a Gaussian \textit{ansatz} for the nuclei density matrix on a curved manifold, allowing us to map roto-librations into harmonic modes defined on a surface. By optimizing the surface's curvature variationally, we minimize the free energy, allowing the spontaneous activation of these degrees of freedom without external parameters. Notably, in the limit of vanishing curvature, we recover the standard SCHA.</description>

      <title>On the Edge Roughness of Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the roughness of mechanically cleaved edges in 2D crystals and glasses using molecular dynamics simulations with chemically accurate machine-learning force fields. Our results show that ultra-flat armchair and zigzag edges can be achieved in graphene by aligning the loading direction with specific lattice orientations. Deviations from these orientations create kinks between the atomically smooth armchair and zigzag segments, with increased irregularities when dynamic effects are considered. Fracture mechanics analysis highlights the kinetic and dynamic factors contributing to crack deflection and edge roughening. In three-atom-thick 2D silica crystals, the relationship between edge morphologies and cleavage conditions is modified by their bilayer structure and sublattice asymmetry. In 2D silica glasses, this correlation is further disrupted by topological disorder. These insights are crucial for minimizing edge roughness in 2D materials, which is essential for their performance in mechanical and electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Predicting Grain Boundary Segregation in Magnesium Alloys: An Atomistically Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) segregation in magnesium (Mg) substantially influences its mechanical properties and performance. Atomic-scale modelling, typically using ab-initio or semi-empirical approaches, has mainly focused on GB segregation at highly symmetric GBs in Mg alloys, often failing to capture the diversity of local atomic environments and segregation energies, resulting in inaccurate structure-property predictions. This study employs atomistic simulations and machine learning models to systematically investigate the segregation behavior of common solute elements in polycrystalline Mg at both ground state and finite temperatures. The machine learning models accurately predict segregation thermodynamics by incorporating energetic and structural descriptors. We found that segregation energy and vibrational free energy follow skew-normal distributions, with hydrostatic stress, an indicator of excess free volume, emerging as an important factor influencing segregation tendency. The local atomic environment's flexibility, quantified by flexibility volume, is also crucial in predicting GB segregation. Comparing the grain boundary solute concentrations calculated via the Langmuir-McLean isotherm with experimental data, we identified a pronounced segregation tendency for Nd, highlighting its potential for GB engineering in Mg alloys. This work demonstrates the powerful synergy of atomistic simulations and machine learning, paving the way for designing advanced lightweight Mg alloys with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Stacking Fault in Non-Close Packed System- Role of Interstitials at Pentahedron Voids in WC Simple Hexagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomistic origin of stacking faults in non-close packed systems is a fundamentally distinct mechanism from the well-known close packed structures with ABC stacking, and represents an uncharted territory in material research. According to experimental data, stacking faults in simple hexagonal WC happen in {1-100} planes that are packed rectangularly and have ABAB stacking. This work identified the type of the defect and crystallographic behaviour by creating energetically relaxed potential atomistic models of stacking faults in WC. Experimental evidence supporting the rotation axis along stacking fault caused by variation in carbon ordering at the interstitial site has been established, in accordance with the theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Sliding-Reversible Bandgap Modulation in Irreversible Asymmetric Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic bandgap of a material is often fixed after fabrication. The capability to realize on-demand and non-volatile control over the bandgap will unlock exciting opportunities for adaptive devices with enhanced functionalities and efficiency. We introduce a general design principle for on-demand and non-volatile control of bandgap values, which utilizes reversible sliding-induced polarization driven by an external electric field to modulate the irreversible background polarization in asymmetric two-dimensional (2D) multilayers. The structural asymmetry can be conveniently achieved in homobilayers of Janus monolayers and heterobilayers of nonpolar monolayers, making the design principle applicable to a broad range of 2D materials. We demonstrate the versatility of this design principle using experimentally synthesized Janus metal dichalcogenide (TMD) multilayers as examples. Our first-principles calculations show that the bandgap modulation can reach up to 0.3 eV and even support a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition. By integrating a ferroelectric monolayer represented by 1T$'''$-MoS$_2$ into a bilayer, we show that the combination of intrinsic ferroelectricity and sliding ferroelectricity leads to multi-bandgap systems coupled to multi-step polarization switching. The sliding-reversible bandgap modulation offers an avenue to dynamically adjust the optical, thermal, and electronic properties of 2D materials through mechanical and electrical stimuli.</description>

      <title>Observing the crack tip behaviour at the nanoscale during fracture of ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultimately, brittle fracture involves breaking atomic bonds. However, we still lack a clear picture of what happens in the highly deformed region around a moving crack tip. Consequently, we still cannot link nano to atomic-scale phenomena with the macroscopic toughness of materials. The unsolved challenge is to observe the movement of the crack front at the nanoscale while extracting quantitative information. Here we address this challenge by monitoring stable crack growth inside a TEM. Our analysis demonstrates how phase transformation toughening, previously thought to be effective at the microscale and above, promotes crack deflection at the nano-level and increases the fracture resistance by ~50%. The work will help to connect the atomistic and continuous view of fracture in a way that can guide the design of the next generation of strong and tough materials demanded by technologies as diverse as healthcare, energy generation or transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal potentials open the door for DFT level calculations at a fraction of their cost. We find that for application to systems outside the scope of its training data, CHGNet\cite{deng2023chgnet} has the potential to succeed out of the box, but can also fail significantly in predicting the ground state configuration. We demonstrate that via fine-tuning or a $\Delta$-learning approach it is possible to augment the overall performance of universal potentials for specific cluster and surface systems. We utilize this to investigate and explain experimentally observed defects in the Ag(111)-O surface reconstruction and explain the mechanics behind its formation.</description>

      <title>Vibrations and damping of the eigenmodes of viscoelastic nanospheres with thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a series of exact analytical closed expressions to calculate the complex eigenfrequencies and the displacement for the corresponding eigenmodes of a viscoelastic (nano-)sphere in the presence of linear damping. Where possible, we provide closed expressions for damping rates, including the contributions from viscosity, as well as thermal conductivity and solutions of the heat equation. We assume an isolated system, such that no energy/heat transfer to the environment is allowed. We find monotonic behavior of the damping as a function of frequency for breathing and torsional modes, however, for spheroidal modes we find non-monotonicity. Furthermore, we analytically analyze the thermodynamic limit for all mode types. We also investigate the frequency shift and find expected behavior, i.e. a reduced eigenfrequency with damping than without damping for breathing and torsional modes. For spheroidal modes, however, we find non-monotonic shifts, corresponding to the damping. For some eigenfrequencies we find anomalous frequency shifts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer MoTe2 exhibits a variety of derivative structural phases and associated novel electronic properties that enable a wealth of potential applications in future electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, a comprehensive study focusing on the complexities of the controllable phase evolution in this atomically thin film has yet to be performed. This work aims to address this issue by systematically investigating molecular beam epitaxial growth of monolayer Mo-Te compounds on bilayer graphene substrates. By utilizing scanning tunnelling microscopy, we explored a series of thermally driven structural phase evolutions including distinct T'-MoTe2, H-MoTe2, Mo6Te6 nanowires, and multistoichiometric MoTe2-x. Furthermore, we carefully investigated the critical effects of the growth parameters-annealing temperature and time and tellurium concentration-on the controllable and reversible phase transformation within monolayer MoTe2-x. The findings have significant implications for understanding the thin film synthesis and phase transformation engineering inherent to two-dimensional crystals, which can foster further development of high-performance devices.</description>

      <title>The Dirac fermions in the altermagnet Ce4X3 (X = As, Sb, Bi)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism exhibits zero net magnetization and spin-splitting electronic structure. The interplay between altermagnetism and topological physics becomes an important topic in the condensed matter physics. In this letter, we propose that the altermagnets Ce4X3 (X = As, Sb, Bi) hosts Dirac fermions in their electronic structure through first-principles calculations and tight-binding model analysis. When subjected to external magnetic field, the altermagnets Ce4X3 (X = As, Sb, Bi) change from altermagnetic state to ferromagnetic state. Accompanied with magnetic order transition, the four-fold degenerate Dirac points is transited into sixtuple degenerate points. Especially, spin-orbital coupling effect has little influence about the Dirac fermions. The topological phases in the altermagnetic state hold the exotic spin-splitter torque and remarkable nonlinear transport effect. Our work paves the way for exploring the interplay between altermagnetism and non-trivial topological phase.</description>

      <title>Origin of the gossamer ferromagnetism in MnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absence of net magnetization in altermagnetis is both a blessing (no stray fields) and a curse (no obvious way to manipulate altermagnetic domains by external fields). Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no measurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a win-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this property. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different mechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe opens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics applications.</description>

      <title>Large electrically and chemically tunable Rashba-Dresselhaus effects in Ferroelectric CsGeX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I) perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rashba-Dresselhaus effects, which originate from spin-orbit coupling and allow for spin manipulations, are actively explored in materials following the pursuit of spintronics and quantum computing. However, materials that possess practically significant Rashba-Dresselhaus effects often contain toxic elements and offer little opportunity for tunability of the effects. We used first-principles simulations to reveal that the recently discovered halide ferroelectrics in the CsGeX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I) family possess large and tunable Rashba-Dresselhaus effects. In particular, they give origin to the spin splitting of up to 171meV in valence band of CsGeI$_3$. The value is chemically tunable and can decrease by 25% and 70% for CsGeBr$_3$ and CsGeCl$_3$, respectively. Such chemical tunability could result in engineering of desired values through solid solution technique. Application of electric field was found to result in structural changes that could both decrease and increase spin splitting leading to electrical tunability of the effect. In the vicinity of conduction and valence band extrema, the spin textures are mostly of Rashba type which is promising for spin-to-charge conversion applications. The spin directions are coupled with the polarization direction leading to Rashba-ferroelectricity co-functionality. Our work identifies lead-free perovskite halides as excellent candidates for spin-based applications and is likely to stimulate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Transformation of Analog to Digital Resistive Switching in Cu Implanted ITO/NiO/Ag Device for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both analog and digital resistive switching are essential components in the neuromorphic computing system. This work reports the influence of Cu ions for the transformation of analog to digital resistive switching in ITO/NiO/Ag memristor devices. The undoped and low-concentration Cu doping illustrates the analog switching, whereas higher doping demonstrates the digital characteristics. At higher bias voltage, the Schottky barrier is developed at both ITO/NiO and NiO/Ag interfaces. The increasing and decreasing of current conduction with the escalating number of cycles for both the polarity in undoped and low doped is elucidated by the electrode-dominated mechanism in terms of reduction and enhancement of Schottky barrier height at the interface, respectively. The digital switching characteristic due to the formation and rupturing of the vacancy filament at higher doped sample is induced due to the boosting of vacancies above the critical amount using ion implantation. The synergic effect of current conduction due to local Cu migration and oxygen vacancies can be utilized as a learning and forgetting process for neuromorphic applications.</description>

      <title>Temperature-induced changes in optical properties of cubic CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$ using phonopy-FHI-aims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research explores how temperature influences the optical characteristics of Cubic Methylammonium Tin Iodide (CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$), a material showing great promise for solar cell technology. The variations in the optical absorption coefficient, refractive index, extinction coefficient, reflectivity, and optical conductivity was examined over a range of temperatures and crystallographic orientations ([100], [010], [001]). The findings indicate that as temperature rises, there is a general decrease observed in the absorption coefficient, refractive index, extinction coefficient, and optical conductivity. Similarly, reflectivity also tends to decrease with increasing temperature. These findings suggest that Cubic CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$ exhibits consistent transparency, a stable refractive index, and relatively high reflectivity across different temperature conditions. Its low optical conductivity, typical of semiconductor materials, indicates its suitability for facilitating efficient charge separation and transport within solar cells. This research significantly adds to our comprehension of optical properties of CH$_3$NH$_3$SnI$_3$, paving the way for its potential use in solar cell applications.</description>

      <title>Examining composition-dependent radiation response in AlGaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N materials have become increasingly important for electronics in radiation environments due to their robust properties. In this work, we aim to investigate the atomistic mechanisms of radiation-induced damage in AlGaN compounds, providing insights that bridge the gap between high-length-scale experimental data and detailed atomic-level processes. Through extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the compositional dependence of radiation-induced defect production in Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$N systems with $x$ ranging from 0 to 1. The damage accumulation characteristics observed in our simulations align notably well with available experimental data at temperatures up to room temperature. Our findings indicate that alloy composition significantly influences defect production and microstructural evolution, including the formation of dislocation loops and defect clusters. Specifically, with increasing Al content, defect production from individual recoil events is reduced; however, extended interstitial defects are more likely to form considering cumulative effects, leading to enhanced damage at high doses. Among the compositions studied, we find that 25\% Al content leads to the least overall radiation damage, suggesting an optimal alloying strategy for mitigating radiation effects. These findings underscore the interplay between defect formation, dynamic annealing, and cascade effects, offering insights for optimizing AlGaN materials for radiation resistance in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Minimum tracking linear response Hubbard and Hund corrected Density Functional Theory in CP2K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the implementation of the Hubbard ($U$) and Hund ($J$) corrected Density Functional Theory (DFT+$U$+$J$) functionality in the Quickstep program, which is part of the CP2K suite. The tensorial and L\"owdin subspace representations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$ forces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\"owdin representations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed minimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters to be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham eigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for different materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the relative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence of the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role of the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the hexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent with those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We conclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\"owdin orthonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived properties.</description>

      <title>Kinetic control of ferroelectricity in ultrathin epitaxial Barium Titanate capacitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectricity is characterized by the presence of spontaneous and switchable macroscopic polarization. Scaling limits of ferroelectricity have been of both fundamental and technological importance, but the probes of ferroelectricity have often been indirect due to confounding factors such as leakage in the direct electrical measurements. Recent interest in low-voltage switching electronic devices squarely puts the focus on ultrathin limits of ferroelectricity in an electronic device form, specifically on the robustness of ferroelectric characteristics such as retention and endurance for practical applications. Here, we illustrate how manipulating the kinetic energy of the plasma plume during pulsed laser deposition can yield ultrathin ferroelectric capacitor heterostructures with high bulk and interface quality, significantly low leakage currents and a broad "growth window". These heterostructures venture into previously unexplored aspects of ferroelectric properties, showcasing ultralow switching voltages ($&lt;$0.3 V), long retention times ($&gt;$10$^{4}$s), and high endurance ($&gt;$10$^{11}$cycles) in 20 nm films of the prototypical perovskite ferroelectric, BaTiO$_{3}$. Our work demonstrates that materials engineering can push the envelope of performance for ferroelectric materials and devices at the ultrathin limit and opens a direct, reliable and scalable pathway to practical applications of ferroelectrics in ultralow voltage switches for logic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Low Leakage Ferroelectric Heteroepitaxial Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N Films on GaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wurtzite (Al,Sc)N ferroelectrics are attractive for microelectronics applications due to their chemical and epitaxial structural compatibility with wurtzite semiconductors such as GaN and (Al,Ga)N. However, the leakage current in epitaxial stacks reported to date should be reduced for reliable device operation. Following the tradition of other semiconductor heterostructures, crystalline structural quality, as measured by breadth of diffraction peaks and correlating with dislocation density, is commonly used as a proxy for leakage current, but we demonstrate here that the crystalline mosaicity that dominates the broadening of diffraction peaks in epitaxial Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N stacks does not dominate leakage current. We report here well-saturated ferroelectric hysteresis loops and orders of magnitude lower leakage current (0.07 A cm$^{-2}$) compared to values reported in literature (1 ~ 19 A cm$^{-2}$) for sputter-deposited epitaxial Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N/GaN of comparable crystalline quality to prior reports. Further, we show Al$_{0.7}$Sc$_{0.3}$N on lattice-matched InGaN buffers with improved structural characteristics exhibits increased leakage characteristics. This demonstration and understanding can help to guide further efforts towards reliable wurtzite ferroelectric devices and prioritize approaches targeting further leakage current reduction.</description>

      <title>Electrical pumping of h-BN single-photon sources in van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic defects in solids offer a versatile basis to study and realize quantum phenomena and information science in various integrated systems. All-electrical pumping of single defects to create quantum light emission has been realized in several platforms including color centers in diamond, silicon carbide, and zinc oxide, which could lead to the circuit network of electrically triggered single-photon sources. However, a wide conduction channel which reduces the carrier injection per defect site has been a major obstacle. Here, we conceive and realize a novel device concept to construct electrically pumped single-photon sources using a van der Waals stacked structure with atomic plane precision. Defect-induced tunneling currents across graphene and NbSe2 electrodes sandwiching an atomically thin h-BN layer allows persistent and repeatable generation of non-classical light from h-BN. The collected emission photon energies range between 1.4 and 2.9 eV, revealing the electrical excitation of a variety of atomic defects. By analyzing the dipole axis of observed emitters, we further confirm that emitters are crystallographic defect complexes of h-BN crystal. Our work facilitates implementing efficient and miniaturized single-photon devices in van der Waals platforms toward applications in quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Giant gate-controlled room temperature odd-parity magnetoresistance in magnetized bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are crucial for understanding the Fermi surface properties, magnetism, and topology in quantum materials. Here, we report the discovery of giant room temperature odd-parity magnetoresistance (OMR) in a bilayer graphene (BLG) heterostructure interfaced with Cr$_2$Te$_2$Ge$_6$ (CGT). Using magnetotransport measurements, we demonstrate that the BLG/CGT heterostructure exhibits a significant antisymmetric longitudinal magnetoresistance, indicative of intrinsic time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking in the system. We show that the OMR is tunable via electrostatic gating. Additionally, the OMR is pronounced near the band edges and diminishes with increasing charge carrier density in graphene. Our theoretical analysis reveals that this phenomenon arises from the coupling of the out-of-plane components of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment to the applied magnetic field in a TRS-broken system. Our findings establish OMR as a significant probe for TRS breaking in quantum materials in which the crystal symmetries preclude the appearance of anomalous Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Zn-Volatility for Compositional Tuning in PtZn Nanoalloy Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimetallic nanoalloys have gained extensive attention due to their tunable properties and wide range of catalytic applications. However, achieving good compositional control in nanoalloy catalysts remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that heat treatment can be used to tune the composition of Pt-Zn nanoalloy catalysts, leveraging the volatile nature of zinc to enhance their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Through identical location (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (IL-(S)TEM) using an in-situ EM gas cell, as well as other complementary techniques, we observed that the zinc content of the Pt-Zn nanoalloy particles decreased over time of the heat treatment under hydrogen. The rate of change depends on the original composition of the particles, as well as the heat treatment conditions such as temperature and flow rate. Our experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that Zn in the intermetallic phase might be more stable, providing an opportunity for precise tuning the nanoparticle compositions. This approach presents a viable strategy for developing better Pt-Zn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.</description>

      <title>Temporal Evolution of Defects and Related Electric Properties in He-Irradiated YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7-\delta}$ Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin films of the superconductor YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) were modified by low-energy light-ion irradiation employing collimated or focused He$^+$ beams, and the long-term stability of irradiation-induced defects was investigated. For films irradiated with collimated beams, the resistance was measured in situ during and after irradiation and analyzed using a phenomenological model. The formation and stability of irradiation-induced defects are highly influenced by temperature. Thermal annealing experiments conducted in an Ar atmosphere at various temperatures demonstrated a decrease in resistivity and allowed us to determine diffusion coefficients and the activation energy $\Delta E = (0.31 \pm 0.03)$ eV for diffusive oxygen rearrangement within the YBCO unit cell basal plane. Additionally, thin YBCO films, nanostructured by focused He$^+$-beam irradiation into vortex pinning arrays, displayed significant commensurability effects in magnetic fields. Despite the strong modulation of defect densities in these pinning arrays, oxygen diffusion during room-temperature annealing over almost six years did not compromise the signatures of vortex matching, which remained precisely at their magnetic fields predicted by the pattern geometry. Moreover, the critical current increased substantially within the entire magnetic field range after long-term storage in dry air. These findings underscore the potential of ion irradiation in tailoring the superconducting properties of thin YBCO films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>High strength self-healable supercapacitor based on supramolecular polymer hydrogel with upper critical solubility temperature</title>

Abstract: Here, we report poly(N-acryloylglycinamide-co-vinyltriazole) p(NAGA-co-VTZ) supramolecular polymer hydrogel doped with activated polypyrrole nanotubes (acPPyNTs) as a high-strength self-healable material for supercapacitors. First, the p(NAGA-co-VTZ) hydrogel films were synthesized by photopolymerization of N-acryloylglycinamide and 1-vinyl-1,2,4-triazole without any cross-linkers. Scanning electron microscopy and mechanical tests showed that initial monomer concentration strongly affects both hydrogel microstructure and resulted mechanical properties. The hydrogels demonstrated self-healing ability through hydrogen bonding at the temperatures above upper critical solubility temperature, excellent mechanical properties (0.9 MPa), large stretchability (1300 %) and cut resistance. Next, as active material for electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) carbonized and ethanol/KOH activated polypyrrole nanotubes (acPPyNTs) were prepared. Symmetric self-healable supercapacitor employing p(NAGA-co-VTZ) hydrogel, acPPyNTs and aqueous 3M KCl solution was assembled. Cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements showed that the prepared device gave a specific capacitance of 282.62 F g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 and high areal capacitance of 316.86 mF cm-2 at scan rate of 10 mV s-1. The supercapacitor operates over wide voltage window (0-1.2 V) and provides excellent cyclic performance with capacitance retention of 97 % after 10 000 cycles and 94 % after self-healing. Overall, the prepared self-healable supercapacitor appears to have considerable potential as high-performance energy storage device.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning electronic structures from ab initio calculations holds great potential to revolutionize computational materials studies. While existing methods proved success in deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian matrices, they are limited to DFT programs using localized atomic-like bases and heavily depend on the form of the bases. Here, we propose the DeepH-r method for deep-learning DFT Hamiltonians in real space, facilitating the prediction of DFT Hamiltonian in a basis-independent manner. An equivariant neural network architecture for modeling the real-space DFT potential is developed, targeting a more fundamental quantity in DFT. The real-space potential exhibits simplified principles of equivariance and enhanced nearsightedness, further boosting the performance of deep learning. When applied to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix, this method significantly improved in accuracy, as exemplified in multiple case studies. Given the abundance of data in the real-space potential, this work may pave a novel pathway for establishing a ``large materials model" with increased accuracy.</description>

Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a non-topological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak-phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provide a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.</description>

      <title>Observation of paramagnetic spin-degeneracy lifting in EuZn2Sb2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taken together, time-reversal and spatial inversion symmetries impose a two-fold spin degeneracy of the electronic states in crystals. In centrosymmetric materials, this degeneracy can be lifted by introducing magnetism, either via an externally applied field or through internal magnetization. However, a correlated alignment of spins, even in the paramagnetic phase, can lift the spin degeneracy of electronic states. Here, we report an in-depth study of the electronic band structure of the Eu-ternary pnictide EuZn2Sb2 through a combination of high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first principles calculations. An analysis of the photoemission lineshapes over a range of incident photon energies and sample temperatures is shown to reveal the presence of band spin degeneracy-lifting in the paramagnetic phase. Our ARPES results are in good agreement with theoretical ferromagnetic-phase calculations, which indicates the importance of ferromagnetic fluctuations in the system. Through our calculations, we predict that spin-polarized bands in EuZn2Sb2 generate a single pair of Weyl nodes. Our observation of band-splitting in EuZn2Sb2 provides a key step toward realizing time-reversal symmetry breaking physics in the absence of long-range magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Layer-dependent electronic structures and magnetic ground states of polar-polar $\rm{LaVO_3/KTaO_3}$ (001) heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing a first-principles and model Hamiltonian approach, we work out the electronic properties of polar-polar LaVO$_3$/KTaO$_3$ (LVO/KTO, 001) heterostrctures, with up to six layers of KTO and five layers of LVO. Our analyses indicate the existence of multiple Lifshitz transitions (LTs) within the $t_{2g}$ bands, which can be fine-tuned by adjusting the number of LVO layers or applying gate voltage. Contrary to the experimental report, spin-orbit coupling is found to be negligible, originating solely from the Ta $5d_{xy}$-derived band of KTO, while the 5$d_{xz}$ and 5$d_{yz}$ bands are considerably away from the Fermi level while LVO overlayers having no role in it. Magnetic properties of the heterostructures, due to Vanadium ions, exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to the number of LVO and KTO layers. Our calculations indicate that the interlayer AFM, (so called A-AFM), is energetically most favorable. This is further supported by ground state energy calculations on extended $\sqrt{2}\times\sqrt{2}$ supercells. Moreover, we find that an insulator to metal transition at the interface requires four LVO layers, corroborating the experimental observation. The interfaces featuring ferromagnetic (FM) ground states turn out to be \textit{half-metallic} after the critical thickness is reached. Considerations of the magnetic interactions appear crucial for the experimentally observed critical thickness for metallicity.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mathematical apparatus which converts magnetostatic (Walker) equations into a wave equation by introducing a specific definition of the magnetic refractive index. Its value can be manipulated by adjusting spatial distribution of the saturation magnetization or the bias magnetic field. We demonstrate that the latter can be accomplished efficiently by utilizing the bias field produced by magnetization patterns recorded onto a neighboring hard magnetic film using the current magnetic storage technology; there is a specific algorithm by which one can convert a two dimensional optical device into its magnetic analogue. The wave equation formalism opens the possibility to adopt a number of optics-like analytical and numerical techniques, including those applicable to scattering, near field, diffraction and geometric (Eikonal equation) optics, as well as a generic finite difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm.</description>

      <title>High-temperature threshold of damage of SiC by swift heavy ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ambient conditions, SiC is known to be resistant to irradiation with swift heavy ions (SHI) decelerating in the electronic stopping regime. However, there is no experimental data on the SiC irradiation at elevated temperatures. To investigate this problem, we evaluate the stability of SiC to SHI impacts at high temperatures up to 2200 K. We apply the combination of the Monte-Carlo code TREKIS-3, describing excitation of the electronic and atomic systems using temperature-dependent scattering cross-sections, with molecular-dynamic modeling of the lattice response to the excitation. We demonstrate that increasing irradiation temperature increases the energy transferred to the atomic lattice from the excited electronic system. This material heating leads to formation of a stable nanometric damaged core along the trajectory of 710 MeV Bi ion when the irradiation temperature overcomes the threshold of ~1800 K. In this case, a chain of nanometric voids along the ion trajectory forms due to the mass transport from the track core by edge dislocations. Voids of larger sizes appear at higher irradiation temperatures. At lower irradiation temperatures, the damaged regions recrystallize completely within ~100 ps after the ion passage.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$ nickel oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nickel oxide superconductors offer an alternative playground for understanding the formation of Cooper pairs in correlated materials such as the famous cuprates. By studying the La$_{n+1}$Ni$_n$O$_{2n+2}$ phase diagram on the basis of hybrid and spin-polarized density functional theory simulations, we reveal the existence of charge and bond ordered (CBO) insulating phases that are quenched by doping effects, ultimately resulting in a metallic phase at the n=5 member. Nevertheless, the phonons associated with the CBO identified in the phase diagram remain sufficiently large to mediate Cooper pairs in La$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$, yielding a computed critical temperature between T$_c$=11-19K consistent with the 13K observed experimentally in Nd$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$. Thus, in order to identify the superconducting mechanism, extracting the relevant instabilities in the doping phase diagram of superconductors appears critical.</description>

      <title>The fate of optical excitons in FAPbI3 nanocube superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the photoexcitation and ultrafast charge dynamics pathways in organic halide perovskite nanocubes and their aggregation into superlattices is key for the potential applications as tunable light emitters, photon harvesting materials and light-amplification systems. In this work, we apply two-dimensional coherent electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to track in real time the formation of near-infrared optical excitons and their ultrafast relaxation in CH(NH2)2PbI3 nanocube superlattices. Our results unveil that the coherent ultrafast dynamics is limited by the combination of the inherent short exciton decay time ~40 fs and the dephasing due to the coupling with selective optical phonon modes at higher temperatures. On the picosecond timescale, we observe the progressive formation of long-lived localized trap states. The analysis of the temperature dependence of the excitonic intrinsic linewidth, as extracted by the anti-diagonal components of the 2D spectra, unveils a dramatic change of the excitonic coherence time across the cubic to tetragonal structural transition. Our results offer a new way to control and enhance the ultrafast coherent dynamics of photocarrier generation in hybrid halide perovskite synthetic solids.</description>

Abstract: Deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) shows great promise to significantly accelerate material discovery and potentially revolutionize materials research. However, current research in this field primarily relies on data-driven supervised learning, making the developments of neural networks and DFT isolated from each other. In this work, we present a theoretical framework of neural-network DFT, which unifies the optimization of neural networks with the variational computation of DFT, enabling physics-informed unsupervised learning. Moreover, we develop a differential DFT code incorporated with deep-learning DFT Hamiltonian, and introduce algorithms of automatic differentiation and backpropagation into DFT, demonstrating the capability of neural-network DFT. The physics-informed neural-network architecture not only surpasses conventional approaches in accuracy and efficiency, but also offers a new paradigm for developing deep-learning DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Vortex matching at 6 T in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films by imprinting a 20 nm-periodic pinning array with a focused helium ion beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlled engineering of vortex pinning sites in copper-oxide superconductors is a critical issue in manufacturing devices based on magnetic flux quanta. To address this, we employed a focused He-ion beam (He-FIB) to irradiate thin YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films and create ultradense hexagonal arrays of defects with lattice spacings as small as 20 nm. Critical current and magnetoresistance measurements demonstrate efficient pinning by an unprecedentedly high matching field of 6 T visible in a huge temperature range from the critical temperature $T_c$ down to 2 K. These results show that He-FIB irradiation provides excellent opportunities for the development and application of superconducting fluxonic devices based on Abrikosov vortices. In particular, our findings suggest that such devices can operate at temperatures far below $T_c$, where superconductivity is robust.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetothermal conductivity in sibling Co-based honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Honeycomb-lattice antiferromagnets have attracted wide attention for exploration of exotic heat transport and their interplay with magnetic excitations. In this work, we have revealed a contrasting behavior in the magneto-thermal conductivity (MTC) between two Co-based honeycomb-lattice magnets Co4M2O9 (M = Nb, Ta), despite their identical lattice structures and quite similar magnetism. Co4Ta2O9 exhibits enhanced MTC of about 550% at 9 T of an in-plane magnetic field, comparable to other honeycomb-magnets, while MTC for Co4Nb2O9 reaches only ~30%. This marked difference is ascribed to distinct features in the field-induced evolution of magnetic excitations that resonantly scatter phonons. This finding sheds light on implicit impacts of non-magnetic ions on thermal transport, and hints at the potential for broad heat-transport tunability while preserving magnetism and lattice structures.</description>
