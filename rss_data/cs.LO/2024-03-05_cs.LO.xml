      <title>Towards the verification of a generic interlocking logic: Dafny meets parameterized model checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlocking logics are at the core of critical systems controlling the traffic within stations. In this paper, we consider a generic interlocking logic, which can be instantiated to control a wide class of stations. We tackle the problem of parameterized verification, i.e. prove that the logic satisfies the required properties for all the relevant stations. We present a simplified case study, where the interlocking logic is directly encoded in Dafny. Then, we show how to automate the proof of an important safety requirement, by integrating simple, template-based invariants and more complex invariants obtained from a model checker for parameterized systems. Based on these positive preliminary results, we outline how we intend to integrate the approach by extending the IDE for the design of the interlocking logic.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Assurance and Synthesis of Controllers from Activity Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic model checking is a widely used formal verification technique to automatically verify qualitative and quantitative properties for probabilistic models. However, capturing such systems, writing corresponding properties, and verifying them require domain knowledge. This makes it not accessible for researchers and engineers who may not have the required knowledge. Previous studies have extended UML activity diagrams (ADs), developed transformations, and implemented accompanying tools for automation. The research, however, is incomprehensive and not fully open, which makes it hard to be evaluated, extended, adapted, and accessed. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive verification framework for ADs, including a new profile for probability, time, and quality annotations, a semantics interpretation of ADs in three Markov models, and a set of transformation rules from activity diagrams to the PRISM language, supported by PRISM and Storm. Most importantly, we developed algorithms for transformation and implemented them in a tool, called QASCAD, using model-based techniques, for fully automated verification. We evaluated one case study where multiple robots are used for delivery in a hospital and further evaluated six other examples from the literature. With all these together, this work makes noteworthy contributions to the verification of ADs by improving evaluation, extensibility, adaptability, and accessibility.</description>

      <title>Constructive S4 modal logics with the finite birelational frame property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logics $\mathsf{CS4}$ and $\mathsf{IS4}$ are the two leading intuitionistic variants of the modal logic $\mathsf{S4}$. Whether the finite model property holds for each of these logics have been long-standing open problems. It was recently shown that $\mathsf{IS4}$ has the finite frame property and thus the finite model property. In this paper, we prove that $\mathsf{CS4}$ also enjoys the finite frame property.
  Additionally, we investigate the following three logics closely related to $\mathsf{IS4}$. The logic $\mathsf{GS4}$ is obtained by adding the G\"odel--Dummett axiom to $\mathsf{IS4}$; it is both a superintuitionistic and a fuzzy logic and has previously been given a real-valued semantics. We provide an alternative birelational semantics and prove strong completeness with respect to this semantics. The extension $\mathsf{GS4^c}$ of $\mathsf{GS4}$ corresponds to requiring a crisp accessibility relation on the real-valued semantics. We give a birelational semantics corresponding to an extra confluence condition on the $\mathsf{GS4}$ birelational semantics and prove strong completeness. Neither of these two logics have the finite model property with respect to their real-valued semantics, but we prove that they have the finite frame property for their birelational semantics. Establishing the finite birelational frame property immediately establishes decidability, which was previously open for these two logics. Our proofs yield NEXPTIME upper bounds. The logic $\mathsf{S4I}$ is obtained from $\mathsf{IS4}$ by reversing the roles of the modal and intuitionistic relations in the birelational semantics. We also prove the finite frame property, and thereby decidability, for $\mathsf{S4I}$</description>

      <title>Analyzing Divergence for Nondeterministic Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Branching and weak probabilistic bisimilarities are two well-known notions capturing behavioral equivalence between nondeterministic probabilistic systems. For probabilistic systems, divergence is of major concern. Recently several divergence-sensitive refinements of branching and weak probabilistic bisimilarities have been proposed in the literature. Both the definitions of these equivalences and the techniques to investigate them differ significantly. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study on divergence-sensitive behavioral equivalence relations that refine the branching and weak probabilistic bisimilarities. Additionally, these equivalence relations are shown to have efficient checking algorithms. The techniques of this paper might be of independent interest in a more general setting.</description>

      <title>Representing Guardedness in Call-by-Value and Guarded Parametrized Monads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like the notion of computation via (strong) monads serves to classify various flavours of impurity, including exceptions, non-determinism, probability, local and global store, the notion of guardedness classifies well-behavedness of cycles in various settings. In its most general form, the guardedness discipline applies to general symmetric monoidal categories and further specializes to Cartesian and co-Cartesian categories, where it governs guarded recursion and guarded iteration respectively. Here, even more specifically, we deal with the semantics of call-by-value guarded iteration. It was shown by Levy, Power and Thielecke that call-by-value languages can be generally interpreted in Freyd categories, but in order to represent effectful function spaces, such a category must canonically arise from a strong monad. We generalize this fact by showing that representing guarded effectful function spaces calls for certain parametrized monads (in the sense of Uustalu). This provides a description of guardedness as an intrinsic categorical property of programs, complementing the existing description of guardedness as a predicate on a category.</description>

      <title>On the Counting Complexity of the Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks, given an integer linear recurrence sequence (LRS), to determine whether the sequence contains a zero term or not. Its decidability is a longstanding open problem in theoretical computer science and automata theory. Currently, decidability is only known for LRS of order at most 4. On the other hand, the sole known complexity result is NP-hardness, due to Blondel and Portier.
  A fundamental result in this area is the celebrated Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, which asserts that the zero set of any LRS is the union of a finite set and finitely many arithmetic progressions. This paper focuses on a computational perspective of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem: we show that the problem of counting the zeros of a given LRS is #P-hard, and in fact #P-complete for the instances generated in our reduction.</description>

      <title>SAT, Gadgets, Max2XOR, and Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Annealers are basically quantum computers that with high probability can optimize certain quadratic functions on Boolean variables in constant time. These functions are basically the Hamiltonian of Ising models that reach the ground energy state, with a high probability, after an annealing process. They have been proposed as a way to solve SAT.
  These Hamiltonians can be seen as Max2XOR problems, i.e. as the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of XOR clauses of at most 2 variables that are satisfied. In this paper, we present several gadgets to reduce SAT to Max2XOR. We show how they can be used to translate SAT instances to initial configurations of a quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Graph Homomorphism, Monotone Classes and Bounded Pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent paper describes a framework for studying the computational complexity of graph problems on monotone classes, that is those omitting a set of graphs as a subgraph. If the problems lie in the framework, and many do, then the computational complexity can be described for all monotone classes defined by a finite set of omitted subgraphs. It is known that certain homomorphism problems, e.g. $C_5$-Colouring, do not sit in the framework. By contrast, we show that the more general problem of Graph Homomorphism does sit in the framework.
  The original framework had examples where hard versus easy were NP-complete versus P, or at least quadratic versus almost linear. We give the first example of a problem in the framework such that hardness is in the polynomial hierarchy above NP. Considering a variant of the colouring game as studied by Bodlaender, we show that with the restriction of bounded alternation, the list version of this problem is contained in the framework. The hard cases are $\Pi_{2k}^\mathrm{P}$-complete and the easy cases are in P.
  The cases in P comprise those classes for which the pathwidth is bounded. Bodlaender explains that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is in P on classes with bounded vertex separation number, which coincides with bounded pathwidth on unordered graphs. However, these graphs are ordered with a playing order for the two players, which corresponds to a prefix pattern in a quantified formula. We prove that Sequential $3$-Colouring Construction Game is Pspace-complete on some class of bounded pathwidth, using a celebrated result of Atserias and Oliva.
  We consider several locally constrained variants of the homomorphism problem. Like $C_5$-Colouring, none of these is in the framework. However, when we consider the bounded-degree restrictions, we prove that each of these problems is in our framework.</description>

      <title>Happy Ending: An Empty Hexagon in Every Set of 30 Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satisfiability solving has been used to tackle a range of long-standing open math problems in recent years. We add another success by solving a geometry problem that originated a century ago. In the 1930s, Esther Klein's exploration of unavoidable shapes in planar point sets in general position showed that every set of five points includes four points in convex position. For a long time, it was open if an empty hexagon, i.e., six points in convex position without a point inside, can be avoided. In 2006, Gerken and Nicol\'as independently proved that the answer is no. We establish the exact bound: Every 30-point set in the plane in general position contains an empty hexagon. Our key contributions include an effective, compact encoding and a search-space partitioning strategy enabling linear-time speedups even when using thousands of cores.</description>

      <title>A Logic of "Black Box" Classifier Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary classifiers are traditionally studied by propositional logic (PL). PL can only represent them as white boxes, under the assumption that the underlying Boolean function is fully known. Binary classifiers used in practical applications and trained by machine learning are however opaque. They are usually described as black boxes. In this paper, we provide a product modal logic called PLC (Product modal Logic for binary input Classifier) in which the notion of "black box" is interpreted as the uncertainty over a set of classifiers. We give results about axiomatics and complexity of satisfiability checking for our logic. Moreover, we present a dynamic extension in which the process of acquiring new information about the actual classifier can be represented.</description>

      <title>Correctly Communicating Software: Distributed, Asynchronous, and Beyond (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of the software we use in everyday life consists of distributed components (running on separate cores or even computers) that collaborate through communication (by exchanging messages). It is crucial to develop robust methods that can give reliable guarantees about the behavior of such message-passing software. With a focus on session types as communication protocols and their foundations in logic, this thesis revolves around the following question: How can we push the boundaries of the logical foundations of session types (binary and multiparty), extending their expressiveness and applicability, while preserving fundamental correctness properties? In this context, this thesis studies several intertwined aspects of message-passing.</description>
