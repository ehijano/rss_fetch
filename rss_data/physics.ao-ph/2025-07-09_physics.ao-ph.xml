      <title>Explaining Surface Layer Theory Departures in Marine Flux Profiles with Data-Driven Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monin--Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which underpins nearly all bulk estimates of surface fluxes in the atmospheric surface layer, assumes monotonic wind profiles and vertically uniform momentum and heat fluxes. Here, we show that conditions frequently arise in coastal marine settings where these assumptions do not hold. Using flux measurements from the Coastal Land-Air-Sea Interaction (CLASI) project's Air-Sea Interaction Spar (ASIS) buoys with wind and flux measurements at typically ~3m and ~5m above the sea surface, we find that wind speed decreases with height in nearly 20% of observations, and that large vertical gradients in sensible heat flux occur near the surface, contrary to what would be predicted by MOST. Both anomalies are strongly modulated by coastal proximity and wind direction, with the highest occurrence rates near shore under offshore winds. These patterns were found using the Discovery Engine, a general-purpose automated system for scientific discovery, which identifies complex relationships in data without prior hypotheses. The Discovery Engine uncovered three distinct mechanisms responsible for breakdowns in MOST assumptions: internal boundary layers formed by offshore continental flow, wave-driven wind jets associated with high wave age, and thermally stable boundary layers over cold sea surfaces where warm, moist air overlies cooler water far from shore. These findings highlight the limitations of current flux algorithms and suggest directions for improved parameterisation in coastal and open-ocean conditions.</description>

      <title>Generative Lagrangian data assimilation for ocean dynamics under extreme sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing ocean dynamics from observational data is fundamentally limited by the sparse, irregular, and Lagrangian nature of spatial sampling, particularly in subsurface and remote regions. This sparsity poses significant challenges for forecasting key phenomena such as eddy shedding and rogue waves. Traditional data assimilation methods and deep learning models often struggle to recover mesoscale turbulence under such constraints. We leverage a deep learning framework that combines neural operators with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to reconstruct high-resolution ocean states from extremely sparse Lagrangian observations. By conditioning the generative model on neural operator outputs, the framework accurately captures small-scale, high-wavenumber dynamics even at $99\%$ sparsity (for synthetic data) and $99.9\%$ sparsity (for real satellite observations). We validate our method on benchmark systems, synthetic float observations, and real satellite data, demonstrating robust performance under severe spatial sampling limitations as compared to other deep learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Downscaling with AI reveals the large role of internal variability in fine-scale projections of climate extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational cost of dynamical downscaling limits ensemble sizes in regional downscaling efforts. We present a newly developed generative-AI approach to greatly expand the scope of such downscaling, enabling fine-scale future changes to be characterised including rare extremes that cannot be addressed by traditional approaches. We test this approach for New Zealand, where strong regional effects are anticipated. At fine scales, the forced (predictable) component of precipitation and temperature extremes for future periods (2080--2099) is spatially smoother than changes in individual simulations, and locally smaller. Future changes in rarer (10-year and 20-year) precipitation extremes are more severe and have larger internal variability spread than annual extremes. Internal variability spread is larger at fine scales that at the coarser scales simulated in climate models. Unpredictability from internal variability dominates model uncertainty and, for precipitation, its variance increases with warming, exceeding the variance across emission scenarios by fourfold for annual and tenfold for decadal extremes. These results indicate that fine-scale changes in future precipitation are less predictable than widely assumed and require much larger ensembles to assess reliably than changes at coarser scales.</description>

      <title>Temperature induced tipping in a two box ocean circulation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate tipping points are critical thresholds in Earth's climate system where a small change can cause abrupt and potentially irreversible shifts towards a new state. Tipping points in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are of much scientific concern because of the large-scale impacts on Earth's climate. A two-box model representing the AMOC, introduced by oceanographer Paola Cessi (1994), revealed a multistable system, and was used to develop a tipping analysis framework to capture critical thresholds under freshwater forcing. Sustained increases in planetary energy uptake motivate the inspection of the model, shifting the focus to thermal dynamics. In this paper, we demonstrate that tipping can occur in the model where the temperature gradient acts as the forcing parameter instead of the freshwater forcing parameter.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent Global Atmospheric Data Assimilation with Machine Learning in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) integrates observations with model forecasts to produce optimized atmospheric states, whose physical consistency is critical for stable weather forecasting and reliable climate research. Traditional Bayesian DA methods enforce these nonlinear, flow-dependent physical constraints through empirical and tunable covariance structures, but with limited accuracy and robustness. Here, we introduce Latent Data Assimilation (LDA), a framework that performs Bayesian DA in a latent space learned from multivariate global atmospheric data via an autoencoder. We demonstrate that the autoencoder can largely capture nonlinear physical relationships, enabling LDA to produce balanced analyses without explicitly modeling physical constraints. Assimilation in latent space also improves both analysis quality and forecast skill compared to traditional model-space DA, under both idealized and real observational settings. Furthermore, LDA exhibits strong robustness across latent dimensions and remains effective even when the autoencoder is trained on inaccurate but physically realistic forecasts, highlighting its flexibility for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient and High-Accuracy Ray Tracing in Discretized Ionospheric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Sfrequency (HF) ray tracing in the complex ionospheric medium generally faces a fundamental trade-off between path accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper presents a high-fidelity Ray Tracing Method (RTM) synergistically amalgamated with a continuously differentiable Galerkin-Difference (GD) interpolation strategy for three-dimensional electron density reconstruction. The RTM-GD can ensure analytically smooth gradients, and thus significantly enhance gradient continuity, numerical stability, and computational efficiency in Hamiltonian-based ray tracing. To systematically evaluate the applicability and performance of RTM-GD, we propose a four-stage experimental design. First, we conduct a grid-resolution sensitivity experiment to evaluate the convergence behavior and directional consistency of the interpolation method under varying spatial scales. Second, we perform an elevation-angle scanning experiment ranging from 3 to 65 degrees within a mid-latitude ionospheric environment. The results indicate that RTM-GD improves path accuracy by over an order of magnitude compared to Catmull-Rom interpolation, while achieving a 14.6-fold increase in computational efficiency relative to the Richardson extrapolation method. Third, we further conduct simulation experiments for high-elevation F2-mode propagation near the critical incident angle. RTM-GD achieves further error reduction compared to the second scheme, confirming its numerical stability and robustness. Finally, we compare synthetic oblique ionograms generated by RTM-GD with observed HF propagation characteristics. The results demonstrate that the model can effectively capture the typical dual-mode propagation behavior of the F2 layer. In summary, RTM-GD delivers accurate and efficent ray tracing in discretized ionospheric models, meeting the demands of HF propagation applications.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition Applied to Sea Surface Temperature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage Koopman mode decomposition to analyze the nonlinear and high-dimensional climate systems acting on the observed data space. The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</description>
