      <title>Project Severe Weather Archive of the Philippines (SWAP) Part 2: Baseline Climatology of Close Proximity Soundings in Hailstorm Environments across Luzon, Philippines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09530v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The environments of severe thunderstorms that produced hail were examined using 171 proximity soundings (2005-2024) archived in the 3rd Data Release of Project SWAP. These soundings were categorized based on their geographical occurrence into three hail-prone environments across Luzon, Philippines. For each case, key parameters describing instability, vertical wind shear, and moisture were calculated to assess the conditions for hail production. The probability of hail occurrence, expressed as a function of W$_{\text{MAX}}$ ($\sqrt{2 \times \text{CAPE}}$) and 0-6 km bulk shear (DLS), revealed patterns distinct from those reported in other regions. Hail events in Luzon were most likely under high CAPE conditions, where boundary-layer moisture was sufficient, mid- and low-level lapse rates were steep, and lifting condensation levels were high. Surprisingly, weak DLS was common across Luzon hail environments, diverging from existing severe weather climatologies, yet large DCAPE indicated environments conducive to damaging wind events. When DLS was replaced with the shear magnitude between the cloud base and equilibrium level, the probability of hail occurrence increased, better aligning with global severe weather climatologies. This finding is supported by hodograph analyses, which show largely unidirectional wind profiles: strong speed shear aloft but weak directional shear in the low-levels. Parameters such as W$_{\text{MAX}}$SHEAR, W$_{\text{MAX}}$SHEAR$_{\text{LCL-EL}}$, and BWD$_{\text{LCL-EL}}$ emerge as potential discriminators between non-severe and severe thunderstorms capable of producing hail, and as useful metrics for assessing convective storm severity in Luzon and possibly countrywide. Finally, two recurring severe setups conducive to hail were identified: (1) an easterly regime associated with trade winds, and (2) a westerly regime linked to the Asian summer monsoon.</description>

      <title>Constraining exoplanet interiors using observations of their atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical surveys have identified numerous exoplanets with bulk compositions that are unlike the planets of the Solar System, including rocky super-Earths and gas-enveloped sub-Neptunes. Observing the atmospheres of these objects provides information on the geological processes that influence their climates and surfaces. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of these planets, including insights into the interaction between the atmosphere and interior based on observations made with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We describe the expected climatic and interior planetary regimes for planets with different density and stellar flux and how those regimes might be observationally distinguished. We also identify the observational, experimental, and theoretical innovations that will be required to characterize Earth-like exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Whipped and mixed warm clouds in the deep sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is indispensable to redistribute nutrients for all life forms larger than microbial, on land and in the ocean. Yet, the development of deep-sea turbulence has not been studied in three dimensions (3D). As a disproportionate laboratory, an array of nearly 3000 high-resolution temperature sensors had been installed for three years on the flat 2500-m deep bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. The time series from the half-cubic hectometer 3D mooring-array allows for the creation of unique movies of deep-sea water motions. Although temperature differences are typically 0.001degrC, variable convection-turbulence is observed as expected from geothermal heating through the flat seafloor. During about 40% of the time, an additional turbulence, 3 times stronger in magnitude, is observed from slantwise advected warmer waters to pass in turbulent clouds. Besides turbulent clouds and seafloor heating, movies also reveal weakly turbulent interfacial-wave breakdown that commonly occurs in the open ocean far away from boundaries.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Machine Learning for Urban Heat Mitigation: Attribution and Weighting of Multi-Scale Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban heat islands (UHIs) are often accentuated during heat waves (HWs) and pose a public health risk. Mitigating UHIs requires urban planners to first estimate how urban heat is influenced by different land use types (LUTs) and drivers across scales - from synoptic-scale climatic background processes to small-scale urban- and scale-bridging features. This study proposes to classify these drivers into driving (D), urban (U), and local (L) features, respectively. To increase interpretability and enhance computation efficiency, a LUT-distinguishing machine learning approach is proposed as a fast emulator for Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) coupled to the Noah land surface model (LSM) to predict ground- (TSK) and 2-meter air temperature (T2). Using random forest regression (RFR) with extreme gradient boosting (XGB) trained on WRF output over Zurich, Switzerland, during heatwave (HW) periods in 2017 and 2019, this study proposes LUT-based (LB) models that categorize features by scales and practical controllability, allowing optional categorical weighting. This approach enables category-specific feature ranking and sensitivity estimation of T2 and TSK to most important small-scale drivers - most notably surface emissivity, albedo, and leaf area index (LAI). Models employing the LB framework are statistically significantly more accurate than models that do not, with higher performance when more HW data is included in training. With RFR-XGB robustly performing optimal with unit weights, the method substantially increase interpretability. Despite the needs to reduce uncertainties and test the method on other cities, the proposed approach offers urban planners a direct framework for feasibility-centered UHI mitigation assessment.</description>

      <title>Understanding Ice Crystal Habit Diversity with Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice-containing clouds strongly impact climate, but they are hard to model due to ice crystal habit (i.e., shape) diversity. We use self-supervised learning (SSL) to learn latent representations of crystals from ice crystal imagery. By pre-training a vision transformer with many cloud particle images, we learn robust representations of crystal morphology, which can be used for various science-driven tasks. Our key contributions include (1) validating that our SSL approach can be used to learn meaningful representations, and (2) presenting a relevant application where we quantify ice crystal diversity with these latent representations. Our results demonstrate the power of SSL-driven representations to improve the characterization of ice crystals and subsequently constrain their role in Earth's climate system.</description>
