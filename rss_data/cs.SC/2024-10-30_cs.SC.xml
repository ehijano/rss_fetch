      <title>Accelerated Relaxation Engines for Optimizing to Minimum Energy Path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few decades, several novel algorithms have been designed for finding critical points on PES and the minimum energy paths connecting them. This has led to considerably improve our understanding of reaction mechanisms and kinetics of the underlying processes. These methods implicitly rely on computation of energy and forces on the PES, which are usually obtained by computationally demanding wave-function or density-function based ab initio methods. To mitigate the computational cost, efficient optimization algorithms are needed. Herein, we present two new optimization algorithms: adaptively accelerated relaxation engine (AARE), an enhanced molecular dynamics (MD) scheme, and accelerated conjugate-gradient method (Acc-CG), an improved version of the traditional conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm. We show the efficacy of these algorithms for unconstrained optimization on 2D and 4D test functions. Additionally, we also show the efficacy of these algorithms for optimizing an elastic band of images to the minimum energy path on two analytical potentials (LEPS-I and LEPS-II) and for HCN/CNH isomerization reaction. In all cases, we find that the new algorithms outperforms the standard and popular fast inertial relaxation engine (FIRE).</description>

      <title>Interpretable Concept Bottlenecks to Align Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05821v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Goal misalignment, reward sparsity and difficult credit assignment are only a few of the many issues that make it difficult for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn optimal policies. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep neural networks impedes the inclusion of domain experts for inspecting the model and revising suboptimal policies. To this end, we introduce *Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents* (SCoBots), that integrate consecutive concept bottleneck (CB) layers. In contrast to current CB models, SCoBots do not just represent concepts as properties of individual objects, but also as relations between objects which is crucial for many RL tasks. Our experimental results provide evidence of SCoBots' competitive performances, but also of their potential for domain experts to understand and regularize their behavior. Among other things, SCoBots enabled us to identify a previously unknown misalignment problem in the iconic video game, Pong, and resolve it. Overall, SCoBots thus result in more human-aligned RL agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/k4ntz/SCoBots .</description>
