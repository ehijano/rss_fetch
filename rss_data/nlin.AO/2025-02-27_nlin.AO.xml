      <title>Optimal COVID-19 vaccine prioritization by age depends critically on inter-group contacts and vaccination rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limited availability of COVID-19 vaccines has prompted extensive research on optimal vaccination strategies. Previous studies have considered various non-pharmaceutical interventions, vaccine efficacy, and distribution strategies. In this work, we address the combined effects of inter-group contacts and vaccination rates under contact reduction, analyzing the Spanish population's demographic and age group contact patterns and incorporating reinfection dynamics. We conduct an exhaustive analysis, evaluating 362,880 permutations of 9 age groups across 6 vaccination rates and two distinct, empirically quantified scenarios for social contacts. Our results show that at intermediate-to-high vaccination rates with unrestricted social contacts, optimal age-based vaccination strategies only slightly deviate from older-to-younger prioritization, yielding marginal reductions in deaths and infections. However, when significant reductions in social contacts are enforced -similar to the lockdowns in 2020-, there are substantial improvements, particularly at moderate vaccination rates. These restrictions lead to a transition where infection propagation is halted, a scenario that became achievable during the pandemic with the observed vaccination rates. Our findings emphasize the importance of combining appropriate social contact reductions with vaccination to optimize age-based vaccination strategies, underscoring the complex, nonlinear dynamics involved in pandemic dynamics and the necessity for tailored, context-specific interventions.</description>

      <title>Extreme vulnerability to intruder attacks destabilizes network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus, synchronization, formation control, and power grid balance are all examples of virtuous dynamical states that may arise in networks. Here we focus on how such states can be destabilized from a fundamental perspective; namely, we address the question of how one or a few intruder agents within an otherwise functioning network may compromise its dynamics. We show that a single adversarial node coupled via adversarial couplings to one or more other nodes is sufficient to destabilize the entire network, which we prove to be more efficient than targeting multiple nodes. Then, we show that concentrating the attack on a single low-indegree node induces the greatest instability, challenging the common assumption that hubs are the most critical nodes. This leads to a new characterization of the vulnerability of a node, which contrasts with previous work, and identifies low-indegree nodes (as opposed to the hubs) as the most vulnerable components of a network. Our results are derived for linear systems but hold true for nonlinear networks, including those described by the Kuramoto model. Finally, we derive scaling laws showing that larger networks are less susceptible, on average, to single-node attacks. Overall, these findings highlight an intrinsic vulnerability of technological systems such as autonomous networks, sensor networks, power grids, and the internet of things, with implications also to the realm of complex social and biological networks.</description>

      <title>Power-law fluctuations near critical point in semiconductor lasers with delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the analogy between laser oscillation and second-order phase transition was indicated in the 1970s, dynamical fluctuations on lasing threshold inherent in critical phenomena have gained significant interest. Here, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate that a semiconductor laser subject to delayed optical feedback can exhibit unusual large intensity fluctuations characterized by power-law distributions. Such an intensity fluctuation consists of distinct intermittent bursts of light intensity, whose peak values attain tens of times the intensity of the maximum gain mode. This burst behavior emerges when a laser with a long time delay (over 100 ns) and an optimal feedback strength operates around the lasing threshold. The intensity and waiting time statistics follow power-law-like distributions. This implies the emergence of nonequilibrium critical phenomena, namely self-organized criticality. In addition to numerical results, we report experimental results that suggest the power-law intensity dynamics in a semiconductor laser with delayed feedback.</description>

      <title>Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov, A. Borisov, Particles 2021, 2 (2021)]. Such a behavior is observed for both non-chiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>
