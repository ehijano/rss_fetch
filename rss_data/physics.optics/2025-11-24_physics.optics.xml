      <title>Broadband telecom single-photon emissions from InAs/InP quantum dots grown by MOVPE droplet epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of quantum materials for single-photon emission is crucial for the advancement of quantum information technology. Although significant advancement has been witnessed in recent years for single photon sources in near infrared band ({\lambda}~700-1000 nm), several challenges have yet to be addressed for ideal single photon emission at the telecommunication band. In this study, we present a droplet-epitaxy strategy for O-band to C-band single-photon source based semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE). Via investigating the growth conditions of the epitaxial process, we have successfully synthesized InAs/InP QDs with narrow emission lines spanning a broad spectral range of {\lambda}~1200-1600 nm. The morphological and optical properties of the samples were characterized using atomic force microscopy and micro photoluminescence spectroscopy. The recorded single-photon purity of a plain QD structure reaches (g(2)(0) = 0.16), with a radiative recombination lifetime as short as 1.5 ns. This work provides a crucial platform for future research on integrated microcavity enhancement techniques and coupled QDs with other quantum photonics in the telecom bands, offering significant prospects for quantum network applications.</description>

      <title>Exponentially enhanced sensing through nonreciprocal light propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocity is a key resource for pushing the performance of photonic devices beyond the fundamental limits imposed by Lorentz reciprocity. Here, we report on the realization of an optical sensor where non-reciprocal light propagation allows detecting small perturbations with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that scales exponentially with system size. Our approach is based on encoding two Hatano-Nelson (HN) chains, which is equivalent to the bosonic Kitaev model, within the resonant modes of an electro-optics frequency comb. Non-reciprocal light propagation in the frequency domain is realized through simultaneous phase and amplitude modulation of the circulating field inside the optical fiber cavity. We demonstrate the sensing of a small modulating tone coupling the two HN chains with a SNR that scales exponentially with the lattice size, formed from up to 70 frequency modes per chain. Our results open a new paradigm in non-Hermitian sensing, with potential applications in remote sensing including the optical readout of superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Single-Axis Ptychographic Coherent Diffractive Imaging for Spectroscopic and Wavefront Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel axial ptychographic coherent diffractive imaging (AP-CDI) technique designed to overcome the critical throughput bottleneck of conventional methods. By replacing the 2D raster scan with a simple 1D axial scan, our approach reduces the number of required diffraction patterns by approximately an order of magnitude while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. We have experimentally validated this concept, successfully performing simultaneous spectroscopic imaging of a sample and quantitative wavefront characterization of the illumination, thereby accurately quantifying the chromatic aberration of a broadband field. This capability establishes AP-CDI as a highly efficient and versatile tool for real-time, multi-modal imaging, with immediate potential in ultrafast science, material characterization, and live-cell bio-imaging.</description>

      <title>Etendue and Radiance Conservation in Transformation Optics: Strict Analytical Bounds on Field Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an intuitive connection between transformation optics (TO) and the classical invariants of etendue and radiance that hasn't been made before. Through explicit application of the optical metric formulation of TO, we demonstrate that any smooth, passive, impedance-matched transformation performs as a canonical (symplectic) mapping on optical phase space. In combination with Hamiltonian ray dynamics, this indicates that Liouville theorem is as well applicable to TO media: the phase-space volume element is preserved, radiance remains constant along rays, and etendue won't decrease under any passive TO mapping. Based on this novel notion, which has never been mentioned in TO literature before, we develop a radiance-invariant phase-space measure specific to TO media. We then utilize it to find severe analytical limitations on field enhancement. We demonstrate that the maximum attainable average intensity in any passive TO concentrator is exclusively constrained by the area-compression ratio of the coordinate mapping, irrespective of material implementation. Using the same paradigm on zero-index media, optical-null media, and illusion devices reveals the same rules. Consequently, our findings demonstrate that transformation optics (TO) can redistribute intensity but cannot increase radiance, and they give a Liouville-type theorem within this field. This provides a consistent, metric-based elucidation for the intrinsic limitations of concentration in passive metamaterials and extreme-index platforms.</description>

      <title>Orbital rotation of spheroidal Mie particles driven by counter-propagating circularly-polarized beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically consider orbital rotation of a spheroidal submicron particle in the field of two counter-propagating circularly polarized Gaussian beams. We derived equations connecting the parameters of the circular orbits centered on the beams axis to the optical force and torque. The equations show that, besides orbital rotation, the spheroidal particle simultaneously rotates around its equatorial axis. We found that two distinct dynamic regimes are possible. The orbital motion can be accompanied by a rapid proper rotation with angular velocity an order of magnitude larger than the angular velocity of the orbital rotation. Alternatively, the orbital and proper rotations can be synchronized. The direction of orbital rotation can either coincide with or be opposite to the direction of rotation of the electric vector. The findings are confirmed by direct numerical simulations. The results can be of use in development of nano-scale gyroscopes as well in shape-selective sorting of submicron particles.</description>

      <title>Aspects of quantum geometry in photonic time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric description of quantum light in photonic time crystals on the SU(1,1) coherent-state manifold. In a projective picture, the evolution of each mode appears as a M\"obius isometry on the Poincar\'e disk, where topologies of trajectories distinguish stable, unstable, and critical regimes. The geometric phase is related to the hyperbolic area enclosed by cyclic paths in the complex projective Hilbert space. This framework offers an intuitive view of stability and topology in quantum photonic time crystals.</description>

      <title>High system efficiency nonlinear frequency conversion on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonic platforms can greatly enhance the efficiency of nonlinear frequency conversion processes by tightly confining light on a sub-micron scale. However, this advantage is often reduced by large fiber-to-chip coupling losses which drastically reduce the overall performance. Here we demonstrate a highly efficient thin-film lithium niobate frequency converter based on periodically poled waveguides combined with direct laser written out-of-plane couplers. Including on-chip and fiber-to-chip losses we obtain a conversion efficiency of 152 %/W, thus demonstrating a promising approach for future scalable integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical Kerr Gate at 1 GHz repetition rate by focusing on BBS glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient detection of ultrafast phenomena is central to modern optical sciences, driving advances in quantum science and technology, physical chemistry, and nanophotonics. When processes occur on sub-picosecond timescales, time-resolved methods such as transient absorption, up-conversion, and optical Kerr gating (OKG) can be utilized to probe these dynamics, though they are typically applied to ensembles rather than single emitters. The OKG technique offers high detection efficiency over a broad spectral range, making it particularly promising for ultrafast single-photon detection at high-repetition-rates. Here, we present an ultrafast scheme based on the third-order nonlinearity of bismuth borosilicate (BBS) glass, operating at a 1 GHz repetition rate with less than 1 nJ pulse energy under focusing, and achieving a time resolution down to 175 fs. BBS glass was selected for its high nonlinear coefficient, which enhances detection efficiency, sub-ps response time, and its compatibility with standard microscopy platforms.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Lattice Coherence and Emission Enhancement in PTM-Passivated CsSnI3 Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites continue to lead in optoelectronic applications, but the toxicity of lead has driven efforts to identify environmentally benign alternatives. Cesium tin iodide is one such, with a direct bandgap and near-infrared emission, though its performance is limited by instability. We show that phthalimide (PTM) passivation during single crystal growth enhances optical output and ambient stability. Under continuous excitation, PTM-passivated microscale crystals show up to a nearly one order of magnitude increase in photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, accompanied by reversible sharpening of a low-frequency Raman mode associated with Cs rattling. This reveals dynamic, light-induced lattice reordering that passivates trap states and enhances radiative recombination. Mechanical grinding yields nanocrystals with redshifted, narrowed PL, consistent with a relaxed polymorph and reduced inhomogeneous broadening. Despite increased surface area, PTM remains effective in preserving near-infrared emission in nanocrystals as well. Power-dependent PL reveals distinct carrier dynamics, where microcrystals show redshift due to bandgap renormalization, while nanocrystals show blueshift and elevated carrier temperatures (300 to 1900 K), consistent with hot-carrier recombination. Extended illumination reveals reversible optical changes, including PL modulation, reflecting dynamic light-matter interactions and evolving defect landscapes. These results identify PTM-passivated Cesium tin iodide as an ideal platform for probing morphology-dependent carrier relaxation and light-induced vibrational coherence in lead-free perovskites.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy on a single nonlinear mode recognizes quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterising optical quantum states is essential for the development of quantum technologies. While traditional approaches to perform full quantum state tomography are often experimentally demanding, neuromorphic architectures may provide an effective alternative. In this work, we demonstrate how a quantum nonlinear driven-dissipative mode is sufficient to act as a quantum reservoir. By analyzing the occupations at different frequencies in the emission spectrum, a linear regression suffices in many cases to recognize the relevant parameters of incident squeezed states. Beyond highlighting the general potential of this approach under continuous driving, we illustrate its effectiveness in an explicit nontrivial example where the source is a degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO), coupled to a nonlinear polariton microcavity.</description>

      <title>Effect of temperature and excitation power on down-conversion process in Tb3+/Yb3+-activated silica-hafnia glass-ceramic films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparent glass ceramics, when activated by rare earth ions, are excellent photonic materials. Regarding photonic glass-ceramics based on silicates, hafnia and silica in a binary system has proved to be an excellent matrix to incorporate rare earth ions in the hafnia nanocrystals, resulting in important luminescence enhancement and, consequently, allowing a large spectrum of critical applications. Here we will focus on the downconversion mechanism driven by the couple Tb3+/Yb3+, largely exploited in photovoltaic systems. The research presented here has been performed on 70SiO2-30HfO2 silica-hafnia glass-ceramic films activated with 19 % rare earth ions: [Tb + Yb]/[Si + Hf] = 19 %. Two main results will be discussed: (a) the intensity and the broadening of the Yb3+ emission band at 975 nm were found to be temperature-dependent, as shown in the figure; (b) the energy transfer mechanism Tb3+ &gt;&gt; Yb3+ will be discussed, referring to the mechanisms that have been proposed in the literature. In relation to the latter topic, the power dependence spectra for the luminescence of Yb3+: 2F5/2 &gt;&gt; 2F7/2 will be discussed.</description>

      <title>OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17126v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib. The source code and datasets will be made publicly available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens2.</description>

      <title>Optical Entanglement Facilitated by Opto-Mechanical Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optomechanical generation of entangled optical beams is usually hindered by thermal noise. We present a theoretical study of low frequency entanglement generation between two optical harmonics emitted from a cavity optomechanical system operating in the resolved-sideband regime. The system comprises three nearly equidistant optical modes in a high-finesse cavity, with the central mode coherently driven. This configuration enables radiation-pressure interactions that generate strong quantum correlations between the two sideband modes. Remarkably, these correlations persist even at large numbers of thermal quanta if one properly engineers the optical cooling rate of the mechanical mode. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of robust entanglement under ambient conditions, opening new avenues for hybrid quantum technologies based on mechanical interfaces and continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Transmission and Glare Maps for Lens Veiling Glare Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the commonly recognized optical aberrations, the imaging performance of compact optical systems-including single-lens and metalens designs-is often further degraded by veiling glare caused by stray-light scattering from non-ideal optical surfaces and coatings, particularly in complex real-world environments. This compound degradation undermines traditional lens aberration correction yet remains underexplored. A major challenge is that conventional scattering models (e.g., for dehazing) fail to fit veiling glare due to its spatial-varying and depth-independent nature. Consequently, paired high-quality data are difficult to prepare via simulation, hindering application of data-driven veiling glare removal models. To this end, we propose VeilGen, a generative model that learns to simulate veiling glare by estimating its underlying optical transmission and glare maps in an unsupervised manner from target images, regularized by Stable Diffusion (SD)-based priors. VeilGen enables paired dataset generation with realistic compound degradation of optical aberrations and veiling glare, while also providing the estimated latent optical transmission and glare maps to guide the veiling glare removal process. We further introduce DeVeiler, a restoration network trained with a reversibility constraint, which utilizes the predicted latent maps to guide an inverse process of the learned scattering model. Extensive experiments on challenging compact optical systems demonstrate that our approach delivers superior restoration quality and physical fidelity compared with existing methods. These suggest that VeilGen reliably synthesizes realistic veiling glare, and its learned latent maps effectively guide the restoration process in DeVeiler. All code and datasets will be publicly released at https://github.com/XiaolongQian/DeVeiler.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian impurity problem</title>

Abstract: The problem of a single Hermitian impurity has long served as a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, offering fundamental insights into the mechanisms of Anderson localization. Yet, despite the increased interest in the spectral and localization properties of non-Hermitian lattices with defects, the non-Hermitian extension of the single impurity problem remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the role of a single complex impurity in one-, two-, and three-dimensional infinite tight-binding lattices. Our study reveals a series of counterintuitive phenomena, including regions where localization vanishes and re-emerges as the impurity strength varies. Next, we study the corresponding finite-sized lattices, which are highly relevant to experimental realizations in readily accessible photonic platforms, revealing a variety of exotic features, such as scale-free localized states, exceptional points, and peculiar cross-shaped localized eigenstates, whose profiles deviate from the conventional exponential localization. This work paves the way for future studies on transport phenomena in non-Hermitian disordered lattices.</description>

      <title>Topological Phase Transition and Geometrical Frustration in Fourier Photonic Simulator</title>

Abstract: XY models with continuous spin orientation play a pivotal role in understanding topological phase transitions and emergent frustration phenomena, such as superconducting and superfluid phase transitions. However, the complex energy landscapes arising from frustrated lattice geometries and competing spin interactions make these models computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we design a programmable photonic spin simulator capable of emulating XY models with tunable lattice geometries and spin couplings, allowing systematic exploration of their statistical behavior. We experimentally observe the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in a square-lattice XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions, accurately determining its critical temperature. Expanding to frustrated systems, we implement the approach in triangular and honeycomb lattices, uncovering sophisticated phase transitions and frustration effects, which are consistent with theoretical predictions. This versatile platform opens avenues for probing unexplored XY model phenomena across diverse geometries and interaction schemes, with potential applications in solving complex optimization and machine learning problems.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Laser Path Solver Algorithm for Virtual Reality Laboratory Simulations</title>

Abstract: femtoPro is an interactive virtual reality (VR) laser laboratory balancing the contrasting challenges of accuracy and computational efficiency in optics simulations. It can simulate linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in real time, a task that pushes the boundaries of current consumer hardware. This paper details the concept, implementation, and evaluation of a dynamic graph-based solution tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of the simulation. Resource usage is optimized through a selective updating strategy that identifies and preserves laser paths unchanged between simulation frames, eliminating the need for unnecessary recalculations. Benchmarking of real-world scenarios confirms that our approach delivers a smooth user experience, even on mobile VR platforms with limited computing power. The methodologies, solutions and insights outlined in this paper may be applicable to other interactive, dynamic graph-based real-time simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards a mobile quantitative phase imaging microscope with smartphone phase-detection sensors</title>

Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging (QPI) enables visualization and quantitative extraction of the optical phase information of transparent samples. However, conventional QPI techniques typically rely on multi-frame acquisition or complex interferometric optics. In this work, we introduce Quad-Pixel Phase Gradient Imaging ($QP^{2}GI$), a single-shot quantitative phase imaging method based on a commercial quad-pixel phase detection autofocus (PDAF) sensor, where each microlens on the sensor covers a $2\times2$ pixel group. The phase gradients of the sample induce focal spot displacements under each microlens, which lead to intensity imbalances among the four pixels. By deriving the phase gradients of the sample from these imbalances, $QP^{2}GI$ reconstructs quantitative phase maps of the sample from a single exposure. We establish a light-propagation model to describe this process and evaluate its performance in a customized microscopic system. Experiments demonstrate that quantitative phase maps of microbeads and biological specimens can be reconstructed from a single acquisition, while low-coherence illumination improves robustness by suppressing coherence-related noise. These results reveal the potential of quad-pixel PDAF sensors as cost-effective platforms for single-frame QPI.</description>

      <title>Quantum optics in the turbulent atmosphere: Fundamental issues and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum light propagation through turbulent atmosphere has become a subject of intensive research, spanning both theoretical and experimental studies. This interest is driven by its important applications in free-space quantum communication, remote quantum sensing, and environmental monitoring. At the same time, this phenomenon itself poses an intriguing fundamental problem. A consistent theoretical description typically makes explicit assumptions about the measurement scheme at the receiver station and/or the method of quantum-information encoding. A common and straightforward approach encodes the information in quantum states of a quasi-monochromatic mode, representing a pulsed Gaussian beam. Atmospheric turbulence induces random distortions of the pulse shape and, consequently, random fluctuations of the transmittance through the receiver aperture. These fluctuations, characterized by the probability distribution of transmittance (PDT), directly affect the quantum state of the received light. In this paper we examine various analytical models of the PDT, validate them through numerical simulations, and assess their range of applicability. Furthermore, we extend the analysis beyond the standard ensemble-averaging approach, recognizing that realistic experiments typically involve time averaging. This requires a detailed examination of the underlying random process, including the study of temporal correlations and their impact on nonclassical properties of electromagnetic radiation.</description>
