      <title>Accurate Trust Evaluation for Effective Operation of Social IoT Systems via Hypergraph-Enabled Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Internet-of-Things (IoT) enhances collaboration between devices by endowing IoT systems with social attributes. However, calculating trust between devices based on complex and dynamic social attributes-similar to trust formation mechanisms in human society-poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, this paper presents a new hypergraph-enabled self-supervised contrastive learning (HSCL) method to accurately determine trust values between devices. To implement the proposed HSCL, hypergraphs are first used to discover and represent high-order relationships based on social attributes. Hypergraph augmentation is then applied to enhance the semantics of the generated social hypergraph, followed by the use of a parameter-sharing hypergraph neural network to nonlinearly fuse the high-order social relationships. Additionally, a self-supervised contrastive learning method is utilized to obtain meaningful device embeddings by conducting comparisons among devices, hyperedges, and device-to-hyperedge relationships. Finally, trust values between devices are calculated based on device embeddings that encapsulate high-order social relationships. Extensive experiments reveal that the proposed HSCL method outperforms baseline algorithms in effectively distinguishing between trusted and untrusted nodes and identifying the most trusted node.</description>

      <title>Digital Voices of Survival: From Social Media Disclosures to Support Provisions for Domestic Violence Victims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domestic Violence (DV) is a pervasive public health problem characterized by patterns of coercive and abusive behavior within intimate relationships. With the rise of social media as a key outlet for DV victims to disclose their experiences, online self-disclosure has emerged as a critical yet underexplored avenue for support-seeking. In addition, existing research lacks a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of DV self-disclosure, support provisions, and their connections. To address these gaps, this study proposes a novel computational framework for modeling DV support-seeking behavior alongside community support mechanisms. The framework consists of four key components: self-disclosure detection, post clustering, topic summarization, and support extraction and mapping. We implement and evaluate the framework with data collected from relevant social media communities. Our findings not only advance existing knowledge on DV self-disclosure and online support provisions but also enable victim-centered digital interventions.</description>

      <title>Structured Information Loss in Network Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a simple algorithm for network embedding, explicitly characterizing conditions under which the learned representation encodes the graph's generative model fully, partially, or not at all. In cases where the embedding loses some information (i.e., is not invertible), we describe the equivalence classes of graphons that map to the same embedding, finding that these classes preserve community structure but lose substantial density information. Finally, we show implications for community detection and link prediction. Our results suggest strong limitations on the effectiveness of link prediction based on embeddings alone, and we show common conditions under which naive link prediction adds edges in a disproportionate manner that can either mitigate or exacerbate structural biases.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Driven Network Data for Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smart city is essential for sustainable urban development. In addition to citizen engagement, a smart city enables connected infrastructure, data-driven decision making and smart mobility. For most of these features, network data plays a critical role, particularly from public Wi-Fi infrastructures, where cities can benefit from optimized services such as public transport management and the safety and efficiency of large events. One of the biggest concerns in developing a smart city is using secure and private data. This is particularly relevant in the case of Wi-Fi network data, where sensitive information can be collected. This paper specifically addresses the problem of sharing secure data to enhance the quality of the Wi-Fi network in a city. Despite the high importance of this type of data, related work focuses on improving the safety of mobility patterns, targeting only the protection of MAC addresses. On the opposite side, we provide a practical methodology for safeguarding all attributes in real Wi-Fi network data. This study was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team of legal experts, data custodians and technical privacy specialists, resulting in high-quality data. On top of that, we show how to integrate the legal considerations for secure data sharing. Our approach promotes data-driven innovation and privacy awareness in the context of smart city initiatives, which have been tested in a real scenario.</description>

      <title>Ketto and the Science of Giving: A Data-Driven Investigation of Crowdfunding for India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to investigate an up and coming crowdfunding platform used to raise funds for social causes in India called Ketto. Despite the growing usage of this platform, there is insufficient understanding in terms of why users choose this platform when there are other popular platforms such as GoFundMe. Using a dataset comprising of 119,493 Ketto campaigns, our research conducts an in-depth investigation into different aspects of how the campaigns on Ketto work with a specific focus on medical campaigns, which make up the largest percentage of social causes in the dataset. We also perform predictive modeling to identify the factors that contribute to the success of campaigns on this platform. We use several features such as the campaign metadata, description, geolocation, donor behaviors, and campaign-related features to learn about the platform and its components. Our results suggest that majority of the campaigns for medical causes seek funds to address chronic health conditions, yet medical campaigns have the least success rate. Most of the campaigns originate from the most populous states and major metropolitan cities in India. Our analysis also indicates that factors such as online engagement on the platform in terms of the number of comments, duration of the campaign, and frequent updates on a campaign positively influence the funds being raised. Overall, this preliminary work sheds light on the importance of investigating various dynamics around crowdfunding for India-focused community-driven needs.</description>

      <title>A Pressure-Based Diffusion Model for Influence Maximization on Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, an individual's local social network carries significant influence over the opinions they form and subsequently propagate to others. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model -- the Pressure Threshold model (PT) -- for dynamically simulating the spread of influence through a social network. This new model extends the popular Linear Threshold Model (LT) by adjusting a node's outgoing influence proportional to the influence it receives from its activated neighbors. We address the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, which involves selecting the most effective seed nodes to achieve maximal graph coverage after a diffusion process, and how the problem manifests with the PT Model. Experiments conducted on real-world networks, facilitated by enhancements to the open-source network-diffusion Python library, CyNetDiff, demonstrate unique seed node selection for the PT Model when compared to the LT Model. Moreover, analyses demonstrate that densely connected networks amplify pressure effects more significantly than sparse networks.</description>

      <title>Podcasts as a Medium for Participation in Collective Action: A Case Study of Black Lives Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how participation in collective action is articulated in podcast discussions, using the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as a case study. While research on collective action discourse has primarily focused on text-based content, this study takes a first step toward analyzing audio formats by using podcast transcripts. Using the Structured Podcast Research Corpus (SPoRC), we investigated spoken language expressions of participation in collective action, categorized as problem-solution, call-to-action, intention, and execution. We identified podcast episodes discussing racial justice after important BLM-related events in May and June of 2020, and extracted participatory statements using a layered framework adapted from prior work on social media. We examined the emotional dimensions of these statements, detecting eight key emotions and their association with varying stages of activism. We found that emotional profiles vary by stage, with different positive emotions standing out during calls-to-action, intention, and execution. We detected negative associations between collective action and negative emotions, contrary to theoretical expectations. Our work contributes to a better understanding of how activism is expressed in spoken digital discourse and how emotional framing may depend on the format of the discussion.</description>

      <title>Extending the BEND Framework to Webgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attempts to manipulate webgraphs can have many downstream impacts, but analysts lack shared quantitative metrics to characterize actions taken to manipulate information environments at this level. We demonstrate how the BEND framework can be used to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraph information environments, and propose quantitative metrics for BEND community maneuvers. We demonstrate the face validity of our proposed Webgraph BEND metrics by using them to characterize two small web-graphs containing SEO-boosted Kremlin-aligned websites. We demonstrate how our proposed metrics improve BEND scores in webgraph settings and demonstrate the usefulness of our metrics in characterizing webgraph information environments. These metrics offer analysts a systematic and standardized way to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraphs using common Search Engine Optimization tactics.</description>

      <title>Fast Unbiased Sampling of Networks with Given Expected Degrees and Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configuration model is a cornerstone of statistical assessment of network structure. While the Chung-Lu model is among the most widely used configuration models, it systematically oversamples edges between large-degree nodes, leading to inaccurate statistical conclusions. Although the maximum entropy principle offers unbiased configuration models, its high computational cost has hindered widespread adoption, making the Chung-Lu model an inaccurate yet persistently practical choice. Here, we propose fast and efficient sampling algorithms for the max-entropy-based models by adapting the Miller-Hagberg algorithm. Evaluation on 103 empirical networks demonstrates 10-1000 times speedup, making theoretically rigorous configuration models practical and contributing to a more accurate understanding of network structure.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning on Large Non-Bipartite Transaction Networks using GraphSAGE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context. Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes. Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks, emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Topology and Fragility of European High-Voltage Networks: A Cross-Country Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable electricity supply depends on the seamless operation of high-voltage grid infrastructure spanning both transmission and sub-transmission levels. Beneath this apparent uniformity lies a striking structural diversity, which leaves a clear imprint on system vulnerability. In this paper, we present harmonized topological models of the high-voltage grids of 15 European countries, integrating all elements at voltage levels above 110 kV. Topological analysis of these networks reveals a simple yet robust pattern: node degree distributions consistently follow an exponential decay, but the rate of decay varies significantly across countries. Through a detailed and systematic evaluation of network tolerance to node and edge removals, we show that the decay rate delineates the boundary between systems that are more resilient to failures and those that are prone to large-scale disruptions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this numerical boundary is highly sensitive to which layers of the infrastructure are included in the models. To our knowledge, this study provides the first quantitative cross-country comparison of 15 European high-voltage networks, linking topological properties with vulnerability characteristics.</description>

      <title>Sublinear-Time Algorithms for Diagonally Dominant Systems and Applications to the Friedkin-Johnsen Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sublinear-time algorithms for solving linear systems $Sz = b$, where $S$ is a diagonally dominant matrix, i.e., $|S_{ii}| \geq \delta + \sum_{j \ne i} |S_{ij}|$ for all $i \in [n]$, for some $\delta \geq 0$. We present randomized algorithms that, for any $u \in [n]$, return an estimate $z_u$ of $z^*_u$ with additive error $\varepsilon$ or $\varepsilon \lVert z^*\rVert_\infty$, where $z^*$ is some solution to $Sz^* = b$, and the algorithm only needs to read a small portion of the input $S$ and $b$. For example, when the additive error is $\varepsilon$ and assuming $\delta&gt;0$, we give an algorithm that runs in time $O\left( \frac{\|b\|_\infty^2 S_{\max}}{\delta^3 \varepsilon^2} \log \frac{\| b \|_\infty}{\delta \varepsilon} \right)$, where $S_{\max} = \max_{i \in [n]} |S_{ii}|$. We also prove a matching lower bound, showing that the linear dependence on $S_{\max}$ is optimal. Unlike previous sublinear-time algorithms, which apply only to symmetric diagonally dominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries, our algorithm works for general strictly diagonally dominant matrices ($\delta &gt; 0$) and a broader class of non-strictly diagonally dominant matrices $(\delta = 0)$. Our approach is based on analyzing a simple probabilistic recurrence satisfied by the solution. As an application, we obtain an improved sublinear-time algorithm for opinion estimation in the Friedkin--Johnsen model.</description>

      <title>Top-r Influential Community Search in Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community search on bipartite graphs, especially influential community detection, has received significant attention. Existing studies use minimum vertex weights, inadequately reflecting true community influence when some vertices have low weights. To address this, we introduce the $(\alpha,\beta)$-influential community model based on the average vertex weights from both layers, providing a more comprehensive influence measure. Given the NP-hardness of accurately identifying top-$r$ communities, we propose an exact recursive algorithm enhanced by a slim tree structure and upper-bound techniques to improve efficiency. Additionally, we develop a greedy approximate algorithm with $O((n+m)+m\log{n})$ complexity, further optimized by a pruning strategy. Experiments on 10 real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM-Based Social Bot via an Adversarial Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing Large Language Model (LLM) agents that exhibit human-like behavior, encompassing not only individual heterogeneity rooted in unique user profiles but also adaptive response to socially connected neighbors, is a significant research challenge. Social media platforms, with their diverse user data and explicit social structures, provide an ideal testbed for such investigations. This paper introduces EvoBot, an \textbf{Evo}lving LLM-based social \textbf{Bot} that significantly enhances human-like generative capabilities through a novel adversarial learning framework. EvoBot is initialized by Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on representative data from social media and then iteratively refines its generation of sophisticated, human-like content via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This refinement is guided by feedback from a co-adapting \textbf{Detector} which concurrently improves its ability to distinguish EvoBot from humans, thereby creating an increasingly challenging learning environment for EvoBot. Experiments demonstrate that EvoBot generates content aligned with diverse user profiles, increasingly bypassing the co-adapting Detector through human-like expression. Moreover, it exhibits strong social responsiveness, more accurately modeling real-world opinion dynamics and information spread in multi-agent simulations. The framework also yields a more robust Detector, underscoring its broader utility for both advanced agent development and related detection tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/kfq20/EvoBot.</description>

      <title>Image memorability predicts social media virality and externally-associated commenting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual content on social media plays a key role in entertainment and information sharing, yet some images gain more engagement than others. We propose that image memorability - the ability to be remembered - may predict viral potential. Using 1,247 Reddit image posts across three timepoints, we assessed memorability with neural network ResMem and correlated the predicted memorability scores with virality metrics. Memorable images were consistently associated with more comments, even after controlling for image categories with ResNet-152. Semantic analysis revealed that memorable images relate to more neutral-affect comments, suggesting a distinct pathway to virality from emotional content. Additionally, visual consistency analysis showed that memorable posts inspired diverse, externally-associated comments. By analyzing ResMem's layers, we found semantic distinctiveness was key to both memorability and virality. This study highlights memorability as a unique correlate of social media virality, offering insights into how visual features and human cognitive behavioral interactions are associated with online engagement.</description>

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems improve the performance of canonical recommender systems with no item features by utilizing diverse content types such as text, images, and videos, while alleviating inherent sparsity of user-item interactions and accelerating user engagement. However, current neural network-based models often incur significant computational overhead due to the complex training process required to learn and integrate information from multiple modalities. To address this challenge,we propose MultiModal-Graph Filtering (MM-GF), a training-free method grounded in graph filtering (GF) for efficient and accurate multimodal recommendations. Specifically, MM-GF first constructs multiple similarity graphs for two distinct modalities as well as user-item interaction data. Then, MM-GF optimally fuses these multimodal signals using a polynomial graph filter that allows for precise control of the frequency response by adjusting frequency bounds. Furthermore, the filter coefficients are treated as hyperparameters, enabling flexible and data-driven adaptation. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that MM-GF not only improves recommendation accuracy by up to 22.25% compared to the best competitor but also dramatically reduces computational costs by achieving the runtime of less than 10 seconds.</description>
