      <title>Average entropy of Gaussian mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the average differential entropy of a $q$-component Gaussian mixture in $\mathbb R^n$. For simplicity, all components have covariance matrix $\sigma^2 {\mathbf 1}$, while the means $\{\mathbf{W}_i\}_{i=1}^{q}$ are i.i.d. Gaussian vectors with zero mean and covariance $s^2 {\mathbf 1}$. We obtain a series expansion in $\mu=s^2/\sigma^2$ for the average differential entropy up to order $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2)$, and we provide a recipe to calculate higher order terms. Our result provides an analytic approximation with a quantifiable order of magnitude for the error, which is not achieved in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Stability in Phase Retrieval: Characterizing Condition Numbers and the Optimal Vector Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily focus on analyzing the stability property of phase retrieval by examining the bi-Lipschitz property of the map $\Phi_{\boldsymbol{A}}(\boldsymbol{x})=|\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}|\in \mathbb{R}_+^m$, where $\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathbb{H}^d$ and $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ is the measurement matrix for $\mathbb{H}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. We define the condition number $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}:=\frac{U_{\boldsymbol{A}}}{L_{\boldsymbol{A}}}$, where $L_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $U_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ represent the optimal lower and upper Lipschitz constants, respectively. We establish the first universal lower bound on $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ by demonstrating that for any ${\boldsymbol{A}}\in\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$, \begin{equation*} \beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}\geq \beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}:=\begin{cases} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\pi-2}}\,\,\approx\,\, 1.659 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{R}$,}\\ \sqrt{\frac{4}{4-\pi}}\,\,\approx\,\, 2.159 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{C}$.} \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove that the condition number of a standard Gaussian matrix in $\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ asymptotically matches the lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ for both real and complex cases. This result indicates that the constant lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ is asymptotically tight, holding true for both the real and complex scenarios. As an application of this result, we utilize it to investigate the performance of quadratic models for phase retrieval. Lastly, we establish that for any odd integer $m\geq 3$, the harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$ possesses the minimum condition number among all $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$. We are confident that these findings carry substantial implications for enhancing our understanding of phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>On Naisargik Images of Varshamov-Tenengolts and Helberg Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VT and Helberg codes, both in binary and non-binary forms, stand as elegant solutions for rectifying insertion and deletion errors. In this paper we consider the quaternary versions of these codes. It is well known that many optimal binary non-linear codes like Kerdock and Prepreta can be depicted as Gray images (isometry) of codes defined over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. Thus a natural question arises: Can we find similar maps between quaternary and binary spaces which gives interesting properties when applied to the VT and Helberg codes. We found several such maps called Naisargik (natural) maps and we study the images of quaternary VT and Helberg codes under these maps. Naisargik and inverse Naisargik images gives interesting error-correcting properties for VT and Helberg codes. If two Naisargik images of VT code generates an intersecting one deletion sphere, then the images holds the same weights. A quaternary Helberg code designed to correct $s$ deletions can effectively rectify $s+1$ deletion errors when considering its Naisargik image, and $s$-deletion correcting binary Helberg code can corrects $\lfloor\frac{s}{2}\rfloor$ errors with inverse Naisargik image.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted OTFS Communications: Phase Configuration via Received Energy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of two revolutionary technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, to enhance high-speed wireless communications. We introduce a novel phase shift design algorithm for RIS-assisted OTFS, optimizing energy reception and channel gain in dynamic environments. The study evaluates the proposed approach in a downlink scenario, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to benchmark schemes in the literature, particularly in terms of bit error rate (BER). Our results showcase the potential of RIS to enhance the system's performance. Specifically, our proposed phase shift design technique outperforms the benchmark solutions by over 4 dB. Furthermore, even greater gains can be obtained as the number of RIS elements increases.</description>

      <title>Certifying almost all quantum states with few single-qubit measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certifying that an n-qubit state synthesized in the lab is close to the target state is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, existing rigorous protocols either require deep quantum circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. In this work, we prove that almost all n-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from only O(n^2) single-qubit measurements. This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits, and observe advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB).</description>

      <title>Interactive Learning of Physical Object Properties Through Robot Manipulation and Database of Object Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for automatically extracting physical object properties, such as material composition, mass, volume, and stiffness, through robot manipulation and a database of object measurements. The framework involves exploratory action selection to maximize learning about objects on a table. A Bayesian network models conditional dependencies between object properties, incorporating prior probability distributions and uncertainty associated with measurement actions. The algorithm selects optimal exploratory actions based on expected information gain and updates object properties through Bayesian inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective action selection compared to a baseline and correct termination of the experiments if there is nothing more to be learned. The algorithm proved to behave intelligently when presented with trick objects with material properties in conflict with their appearance. The robot pipeline integrates with a logging module and an online database of objects, containing over 24,000 measurements of 63 objects with different grippers. All code and data are publicly available, facilitating automatic digitization of objects and their physical properties through exploratory manipulations.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Sampling in the Dual Divergence Space: A Data-efficient &amp; Interpretative Approach for Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the remarkable achievements in generative sampling of natural images, we propose an innovative challenge, potentially overly ambitious, which involves generating samples of entire multivariate time series that resemble images. However, the statistical challenge lies in the small sample size, sometimes consisting of a few hundred subjects. This issue is especially problematic for deep generative models that follow the conventional approach of generating samples from a canonical distribution and then decoding or denoising them to match the true data distribution. In contrast, our method is grounded in information theory and aims to implicitly characterize the distribution of images, particularly the (global and local) dependency structure between pixels. We achieve this by empirically estimating its KL-divergence in the dual form with respect to the respective marginal distribution. This enables us to perform generative sampling directly in the optimized 1-D dual divergence space. Specifically, in the dual space, training samples representing the data distribution are embedded in the form of various clusters between two end points. In theory, any sample embedded between those two end points is in-distribution w.r.t. the data distribution. Our key idea for generating novel samples of images is to interpolate between the clusters via a walk as per gradients of the dual function w.r.t. the data dimensions. In addition to the data efficiency gained from direct sampling, we propose an algorithm that offers a significant reduction in sample complexity for estimating the divergence of the data distribution with respect to the marginal distribution. We provide strong theoretical guarantees along with an extensive empirical evaluation using many real-world datasets from diverse domains, establishing the superiority of our approach w.r.t. state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</description>

      <title>Precoder Design for User-Centric Network Massive MIMO with Matrix Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the precoder design for user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink with matrix manifold optimization. In UCN mMIMO systems, each user terminal (UT) is served by a subset of base stations (BSs) instead of all the BSs, facilitating the implementation of the system and lowering the dimension of the precoders to be designed. By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system.</description>

      <title>Trainable Joint Channel Estimation, Detection and Decoding for MIMO URLLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The receiver design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) systems can be a tough task due to the use of short channel codes and few pilot symbols. Consequently, error propagation can occur in traditional turbo receivers, leading to performance degradation. Moreover, the processing delay induced by information exchange between different modules may also be undesirable for URLLC. To address the issues, we advocate to perform joint channel estimation, detection, and decoding (JCDD) for MIMO URLLC systems encoded by short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Specifically, we develop two novel JCDD problem formulations based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion for Gaussian MIMO channels and sparse mmWave MIMO channels, respectively, which integrate the pilots, the bit-to-symbol mapping, the LDPC code constraints, as well as the channel statistical information. Both the challenging large-scale non-convex problems are then solved based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms, where closed-form solutions are achieved in each ADMM iteration. Furthermore, two JCDD neural networks, called JCDDNet-G and JCDDNet-S, are built by unfolding the derived ADMM algorithms and introducing trainable parameters. It is interesting to find via simulations that the proposed trainable JCDD receivers can outperform the turbo receivers with affordable computational complexities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization linear precoder design for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. We consider a single-cell system with multiple users and propose a unified matrix manifold optimization framework applicable to total power constraint (TPC), per-user power constraint (PUPC) and per-antenna power constraint (PAPC). We prove that the precoders under TPC, PUPC and PAPC are on distinct Riemannian submanifolds, and transform the constrained problems in Euclidean space to unconstrained ones on manifolds. In accordance with this, we derive Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, Riemannian Hessian, retraction and vector transport, which are needed for precoder design in the matrix manifold framework. Then, Riemannian design methods using Riemannian steepest descent, Riemannian conjugate gradient and Riemannian trust region are provided to design the WSR-maximization precoders under TPC, PUPC or PAPC. Riemannian methods do not involve the inverses of the large dimensional matrices during the iterations, reducing the computational complexities of the algorithms. Complexity analyses and performance simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed precoder design.</description>

      <title>Towards Goal-Oriented Semantic Communications: New Metrics, Open Challenges, and Future Research Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Shannon's pioneering masterpiece which established the prototype of modern information theory, the goal of communications has long been promising accurate message reconstruction at a refined bit-by-bit level, which deliberately neglects the semantics/effectiveness aspect of information. Nevertheless, the recent development of wireless technologies and the spurt of deep learning (DL) techniques allow us to reclaim the meaning/usefulness aspect in the design of future 6G communication paradigms, where goal-oriented communication is becoming a trend. Age of Information (AoI), a well-known metric that captures the importance of information by recording the time elapsed from the generation time slot, has been extended to various variants, such as Value of Information (VoI), Urgency of Information (UoI), Age of Incorrect Information (AoII), and etc. While each of them proposes novel ways to measure the meaning/usefulness aspect of information, there is not yet an integrated framework encompassing all of them. To this end, we propose a novel tensor-based approach, the Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT), to unify them, which also allows more flexible and fine-grained goal characterizations. Following the proposed GoT, we architect a holistic goal-oriented framework to enable goal-oriented semantic communications, in which information perception, dissemination, and control-plane decisions are implemented in accordance with specific goals. Finally, we outline several open challenges to fulfill the vision of the GoT framework.</description>

Abstract: Pseudo-random arrays and perfect maps are the two-dimensional analogs of M-sequences and de Bruijn sequences, respectively. We modify the definitions to be applied to codes. These codes are also the two-dimensional analogs of certain factors in the de Bruijn graph. These factors are called zero factors and perfect factors in the de Bruijn graph. We apply a folding technique to construct pseudo-random array codes and examine the minimum distance of the constructed codes. The folding is applied on sequences generated from irreducible polynomials or a product of irreducible polynomials with the same degree and the same exponent. Direct and recursive constructions for de Bruijn array codes are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>RIShield: Enabling Electromagnetic Blackout in Radiation-Sensitive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a disruptive technology with the potential to revolutionize wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present RIShield, a novel application of RIS technology specifically designed for radiation-sensitive environments. The aim of RIShield is to enable electromagnetic blackouts, preventing radiation leakage from target areas. We propose a comprehensive framework for RIShield deployment, considering the unique challenges and requirements of radiation-sensitive environments. By strategically positioning RIS panels, we create an intelligent shielding mechanism that selectively absorbs and reflects electromagnetic waves, effectively blocking radiation transmission. To achieve optimal performance, we model the corresponding channel and design a dynamic control that adjusts the RIS configuration based on real-time radiation monitoring. By leveraging the principles of reconfiguration and intelligent control, RIShield ensures adaptive and efficient protection while minimizing signal degradation. Through full-wave and ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RIShield in achieving significant electromagnetic attenuation. Our results highlight the potential of RIS technology to address critical concerns in radiation-sensitive environments, paving the way for safer and more secure operations in industries such as healthcare, nuclear facilities, and defense.</description>

      <title>Nearest-Neighbours Estimators for Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional mutual information quantifies the conditional dependence of two random variables. It has numerous applications; it forms, for example, part of the definition of transfer entropy, a common measure of the causal relationship between time series. It does, however, require a lot of data to estimate accurately and suffers the curse of dimensionality, limiting its application in machine learning and data science. However, the Kozachenko-Leonenko approach can address this problem: it is possible, in this approach to define a nearest-neighbour estimator which depends only on the distance between data points and not on the dimension of the data. Furthermore, the bias can be calculated analytically for this estimator. Here this estimator is described and is tested on simulated data.</description>

Abstract: The channel hardening effect is less pronounced in the cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system compared to its cellular counterpart, making it necessary to estimate the downlink effective channel gains to ensure decent performance. However, the downlink training inadvertently creates an opportunity for adversarial nodes to launch pilot spoofing attacks (PSAs). First, we demonstrate that adversarial distributed access points (APs) can severely degrade the achievable downlink rate. They achieve this by estimating their channels to users in the uplink training phase and then precoding and sending the same pilot sequences as those used by legitimate APs during the downlink training phase. Then, the impact of the downlink PSA is investigated by rigorously deriving a closed-form expression of the per-user achievable downlink rate. By employing the min-max criterion to optimize the power allocation coefficients, the maximum per-user achievable rate of downlink transmission is minimized from the perspective of adversarial APs. As an alternative to the downlink PSA, adversarial APs may opt to precode random interference during the downlink data transmission phase in order to disrupt legitimate communications. In this scenario, the achievable downlink rate is derived, and then power optimization algorithms are also developed. We present numerical results to showcase the detrimental impact of the downlink PSA and compare the effects of these two types of attacks.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Multi-User MIMO Equalization via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large pre-trained sequence models, such as transformers, excel as few-shot learners capable of in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, a model is trained to adapt its operation to a new task based on limited contextual information, typically in the form of a few training examples for the given task. Previous work has explored the use of ICL for channel equalization in single-user multi-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this work, we demonstrate that ICL can be also used to tackle the problem of multi-user equalization in cell-free MIMO systems with limited fronthaul capacity. In this scenario, a task is defined by channel statistics, signal-to-noise ratio, and modulation schemes. The context encompasses the users' pilot sequences, the corresponding quantized received signals, and the current received data signal. Different prompt design strategies are proposed and evaluated that encompass also large-scale fading and modulation information. Experiments demonstrate that ICL-based equalization provides estimates with lower mean squared error as compared to the linear minimum mean squared error equalizer, especially in the presence of limited fronthaul capacity and pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>Joint Active And Passive IRS Aided Wireless Communication: Elements Allocation and Achievable Rate</title>

Abstract: Equipping reflecting elements at the active intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS) enhances signal amplification capability but meanwhile incurs non-negligible amplification noise, which thus challenges the determination of elements allocation for maximizing achievable rate in multi-cooperative AIRS and passive IRS (PIRS) jointly aided wireless communication system. To tackle this issue, we consider the downlink communication from a single-antenna transmitter (Tx) to a single-antenna receiver (Rx), which aided by a pair of AIRS and PIRS with two different deployment orders. Specifically, we target to determine the number of AIRS/PIRS elements over both transmission orders under given deployment budget for the achievable rate maximization. Our analysis illustrates that the PIRS should be allocated more elements than the AIRS for achieving optimized rate and linear signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling orders are attained in both schemes. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the rate performance of the AIRS and PIRS jointly aided wireless system with various benchmark systems.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Why Local Aggregation Helps: Convergence Analysis of Hierarchical SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12998</link>

Abstract: Hierarchical SGD (H-SGD) has emerged as a new distributed SGD algorithm for multi-level communication networks. In H-SGD, before each global aggregation, workers send their updated local models to local servers for aggregations. Despite recent research efforts, the effect of local aggregation on global convergence still lacks theoretical understanding. In this work, we first introduce a new notion of "upward" and "downward" divergences. We then use it to conduct a novel analysis to obtain a worst-case convergence upper bound for two-level H-SGD with non-IID data, non-convex objective function, and stochastic gradient. By extending this result to the case with random grouping, we observe that this convergence upper bound of H-SGD is between the upper bounds of two single-level local SGD settings, with the number of local iterations equal to the local and global update periods in H-SGD, respectively. We refer to this as the "sandwich behavior". Furthermore, we extend our analytical approach based on "upward" and "downward" divergences to study the convergence for the general case of H-SGD with more than two levels, where the "sandwich behavior" still holds. Our theoretical results provide key insights of why local aggregation can be beneficial in improving the convergence of H-SGD.</description>

      <title>Expansion of higher-dimensional cubical complexes with application to quantum locally testable codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high-dimensional cubical complex, for any dimension t&gt;0, and apply it to the design of quantum locally testable codes. Our complex is a natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) respectively.
  We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.
  For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs -- with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.</description>
