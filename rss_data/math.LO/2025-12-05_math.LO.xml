      <title>Maehara Interpolation in Extensions of R-mingle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are exactly five quasivarieties of Sugihara algebras with the amalgamation property, and that all of these have the relative congruence extension property. As a consequence, we obtain that the amalgamation property and transferable injections property coincide for arbitrary quasivarieties of Sugihara algebras. These results provide a complete description of arbitrary (not merely axiomatic) extensions of the logic R-mingle that have the Maehara interpolation property, and further demonstrates that the Robinson property and Maehara interpolation property coincide for arbitrary extensions of R-mingle. Further, we show that the question of whether a given finitely based extension of R-mingle has the Maehara interpolation property is decidable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every ordered abelian group $G$ there exists a non-trivial ordered abelian group $H$ such that $G\preccurlyeq H\oplus G$ with the lexicographic order, and give a first-order characterization of ordered abelian group $G$ such that $G\preccurlyeq G\oplus H$ for some non-trivial $H$. We apply this to characterize which ordered abelian groups (respectively fields) ensure that any henselian valuation with said value group (respectively residue field) is definable in the language of rings. This answers a question of Krapp, Kuhlmann, and Link.</description>

      <title>Existentially defining valuations in function fields over large fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a large field such that $K[\sqrt{-1}]$ is not algebraically closed and $F/K$ a function field in one variable. Extending techniques and results from earlier work with Becher and Dittmann, we show that every valuation ring on $F$ containing $K$ is existentially definable in the language of rings with parameters from $F$. As a consequence, using a known reduction technique, we obtain the undecidability of the existential theory of $F$ in the language of rings with appropriately chosen parameters.</description>

      <title>Extension of Lipschitz maps definable in Hensel minimal structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a theorem on extension of Lipschitz maps $f$ definable in Hensel minimal, non-trivially valued fields $K$ of equicharacteristic zero. This may be regarded as a definable, non-Archimedean, non-locally compact version of Kirszbraun's extension theorem. We proceed with double induction with respect to the dimensions of the ambient space and of the domain of $f$. To this end we introduce the concept of a definable open cell package with a skeleton, which along with the concept of a risometry plays a key role in our induction procedure.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Distributed Algorithms and Measurable Combinatorics on $\Delta$-Regular Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the connections between the fields of distributed computing and measurable combinatorics by considering complexity classes of locally checkable labeling problems on regular forests. We show that the most important deterministic complexity classes from the LOCAL model of distributed computing exactly coincide with well-studied classes in measurable combinatorics. Namely, first we show that a locally checkable labeling problem admits a continuous solution if and only if it can be solved by a deterministic local algorithm with complexity $O(\log^* n)$. Second, our main result states that, surprisingly, a locally checkable labeling problem admits a Baire measurable solution if and only if it can be solved by a local algorithm with complexity $O(\log n)$. These theorems suggest the existence of deeper connections between the two frameworks. Furthermore, the latter result relies on a complete combinatorial characterization of the classes in question, and as a by-product, it shows that membership in these classes is decidable.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the consistency of a weakly compact cardinal above a regular uncountable cardinal $\mu$, we prove the consistency of the existence of a wide $\mu^+$-Aronszajn tree, i.e. a tree of height and cardinality $\mu^+$ with no branches of length $\mu^+$, into which every wide $\mu^+$-Aronszajn tree can be embedded.</description>

      <title>On the Compatibility of Constructive Predicative Mathematics with Weyl's Classical Predicativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04161v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that most constructive and predicative foundations aiming to develop Bishop's constructive analysis are incompatible with a classical predicative development of analysis as put forward by Weyl in his $\textit{Das Kontinuum}$. Here, we show how this incompatibility arises from the possibility to define sets by quantifying over (the exponentiation of) functional relations. Such a possibility is present in most constructive foundations but it is not allowed in modern reformulations of Weyl's logical system. In particular, we show how in Aczel's Constructive Set Theory, Martin-L\"of's type theory and Homotopy Type Theory, the incompatibility with classical predicativity \`a la Weyl reduces to the fact of being able to interpret Heyting arithmetic in all finite types with the addition of the internal rule of number-theoretic unique choice, identifying functional relations over natural numbers with a primitive notion of function defined as $\lambda$-terms of type theory. Then, we argue that a possible way out is offered by constructive foundations, such as the Minimalist Foundation, where exponentiation is limited to functions defined as $\lambda$-terms of (dependent) type theory. The price to pay is to renounce number-theoretic choice principles, including the rule of unique choice, typical of most foundations formalizing Bishop's constructive mathematics. This restriction calls for a point-free constructive development of topology as advocated by P. Martin-L\"of and G. Sambin with the introduction of Formal Topology. We then conclude that the Minimalist Foundation promises to be a natural crossroads between Bishop's constructivism and Weyl's classical predicativity provided that a point-free constructive reformulation of analysis is viable.</description>

      <title>Bi-Isolated d.c.e. Degrees and $\Sigma_1$ Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Turing degree is d.c.e. if it contains a set that is the difference of two c.e. sets. A d.c.e. degree $\mathbf{d}$ is isolated if there exists a c.e. degree $\mathbf{a}&lt;\mathbf{d}$ such that every c.e. degree below $\mathbf{d}$ is also below $\mathbf{a}$; $\mathbf{d}$ is upper isolated if there exists a c.e. degree $\mathbf{a}&gt;\mathbf{d}$ such that every c.e. degree above $\mathbf{d}$ is also above $\mathbf{a}$; $\mathbf{d}$ is bi-isolated if it is both isolated and upper isolated. In this paper, we prove the existence of bi-isolated d.c.e. degrees in models of $\mathsf{I}\Sigma_1$.</description>

      <title>Coinductive proof search for polarized logic with applications to full intuitionistic propositional logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.16161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The approach to proof search dubbed "coinductive proof search" (CoIPS), and previously developed by the authors for implicational intuitionistic logic, is in this paper extended to LJP, a focused sequent-calculus presentation of polarized intuitionistic logic, including an array of positive and negative connectives. As before, this includes developing a coinductive description of the search space generated by a sequent, an equivalent inductive syntax describing the same space, and decision procedures for inhabitation problems in the form of predicates defined by recursion on the inductive syntax. Inhabitation is taken in a generalized sense, because we also consider when a sequent has a solution, that is a (possibly infinite) run of bottom-up proof search which never fails to apply another inference rule. We provide a very general scheme whose instances are decision problems concerning solutions in LJP having algorithms through the inductive syntax. Polarized logic and LJP can be used as a platform from which proof search for other logics is understood. We illustrate this for the proof systems LJT and LJQ for intuitionistic logic, both equipped with all the connectives. For that we work out respectively a negative and a positive interpretation into LJP, which map formulas of the source logic into formulas in LJP of the said polarity; and this even at the level of the coinductive versions of the three involved proof systems. The interpretations are proved to be, not only faithful, but actually full embeddings, establishing a bijection between the solutions (resp. proofs) of a sequent and the solutions (resp. proofs) of its polarized interpretation. This allows the inheritance to the source systems of the decidability and other results previously obtained for LJP, thereby vastly generalizing the previous results of CoIPS, which were confined to LJT and implicational intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <title>Decidability of polynomial equations over function fields in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of positive characteristic with no algebraically closed subfield. Let $F$ be a function field over $K$ and $t \in F$ transcendental over $K$. Refining a result of Eisentr{\"a}ger and Shlapentokh, we show that there is no algorithm which, on input a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{Z}[t][X_1, \ldots, X_n]$, determines whether $f$ has a zero in $F^n$. To this end, we revisit and partially extend several recent results from the literature on existential definability in function fields.</description>
