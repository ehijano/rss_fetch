      <title>A Multi-Fidelity Global Search Framework for Hotspot Prevention in 3D Thermal Design Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a B\'ezier-based Multi-Fidelity Thermal Optimization Framework, which is a computationally efficient methodology for the global optimization of 3D heat sinks. The flexible B\'ezier-parameterized fin geometries and the adopted multi-fidelity pseudo-3D thermal modeling strategy meet at a balance between accuracy and computational cost. In this method, the smooth and compact B\'ezier representation of fins defines the design space from which diverse topologies can be generated with minimal design variables. A global optimizer, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, minimizes the pressure drop with respect to a given surface-average temperature constraint to achieve improvement in the pressure loss. In the framework, the pseudo-3D model couples two thermally interacting 2D layers: a thermofluid layer representing the fluid domain passing through the fins, and a conductive base plate representing the surface where excessive average temperature is to be avoided. Both layers are coupled with calibrated heat transfer coefficients obtained from high-fidelity 3D simulations. For several fin geometries, the proposed framework has been validated by comparing the pseudo-3D results with those of full 3D simulations, which yielded good agreement in terms of temperature distribution and pressure drops when the computational cost was reduced by several orders of magnitude. Optimization results show that it attains up to 50\% pressure loss reduction compared to conventional straight-fin configurations, and it reveals a clear trade-off between thermal performance and hydraulic efficiency. Thus, the proposed method forms a new basis for fast, geometry-flexible, and optimized heat sink design, enabling efficient exploration of complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Optimized Motion Artifact Correction in 3D MRI Using Pre-trained 2D Score Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remain a major challenge, as they degrade image quality and compromise diagnostic reliability. Score-based generative models (SGMs) have recently shown promise for artifact removal. However, existing 3D SGM-based approaches are limited in two key aspects: (1) their strong dependence on known forward operators makes them ineffective for correcting MRI motion artifacts, and (2) their slow inference speed hinders clinical translation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a wavelet-optimized end-to-end framework for 3D MRI motion correct using pre-trained 2D score priors (3D-WMoCo). Specifically, two orthogonal 2D score priors are leveraged to guide the 3D distribution prior, while a mean-reverting stochastic differential equation (SDE) is employed to model the restoration process of motion-corrupted 3D volumes to motion-free 3D distribution. Furthermore, wavelet diffusion is introduced to accelerate inference, and wavelet convolution is applied to enhance feature extraction. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through both simulated motion artifact experiments and real-world clinical motion artifact correction tests. The proposed method achieves robust performance improvements over existing techniques. Implementation details and source code are available at: https://github.com/ZG-yuan/3D-WMoCo.</description>

      <title>Prompting for Policy: Forecasting Macroeconomic Scenarios with Synthetic LLM Personas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate whether persona-based prompting improves Large Language Model (LLM) performance on macroeconomic forecasting tasks. Using 2,368 economics-related personas from the PersonaHub corpus, we prompt GPT-4o to replicate the ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters across 50 quarterly rounds (2013-2025). We compare the persona-prompted forecasts against the human experts panel, across four target variables (HICP, core HICP, GDP growth, unemployment) and four forecast horizons. We also compare the results against 100 baseline forecasts without persona descriptions to isolate its effect. We report two main findings. Firstly, GPT-4o and human forecasters achieve remarkably similar accuracy levels, with differences that are statistically significant yet practically modest. Our out-of-sample evaluation on 2024-2025 data demonstrates that GPT-4o can maintain competitive forecasting performance on unseen events, though with notable differences compared to the in-sample period. Secondly, our ablation experiment reveals no measurable forecasting advantage from persona descriptions, suggesting these prompt components can be omitted to reduce computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Our results provide evidence that GPT-4o can achieve competitive forecasting accuracy even on out-of-sample macroeconomic events, if provided with relevant context data, while revealing that diverse prompts produce remarkably homogeneous forecasts compared to human panels.</description>

      <title>Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</description>

      <title>In Situ Training of Implicit Neural Compressors for Scientific Simulations via Sketch-Based Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02659v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result. While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning, we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons, and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.</description>

      <title>Aethorix v1.0: An Integrated Scientific AI Agent for Scalable Inorganic Materials Innovation and Industrial Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining the frontiers of scientific domains, ranging from drug discovery to meteorological modeling, yet its integration within industrial manufacturing remains nascent and fraught with operational challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce Aethorix v1.0, an AI agent framework designed to overcome key industrial bottlenecks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in materials design innovation and process parameter optimization. Our tool is built upon three pillars: a scientific corpus reasoning engine that streamlines knowledge retrieval and validation, a diffusion-based generative model for zero-shot inverse design, and specialized interatomic potentials that enable faster screening with ab initio fidelity. We demonstrate Aethorix's utility through a real-world cement production case study, confirming its capacity for integration into industrial workflows and its role in revolutionizing the design-make-test-analyze loop while ensuring rigorous manufacturing standards are met.</description>

      <title>A Copula-based variational autoencoder for uncertainty quantification in inverse problems: application to damage identification in an offshore wind turbine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural Health Monitoring of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines (FOWTs) is critical for ensuring operational safety and efficiency. However, identifying damage in components like mooring systems from limited sensor data poses a challenging inverse problem, often characterized by multimodal solutions where various damage states could explain the observed response. To overcome it, we propose a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, where the encoder approximates the inverse operator, while the decoder approximates the forward. The posterior distribution of the latent space variables is probabilistically modeled, describing the uncertainties in the estimates. This work tackles the limitations of conventional Gaussian Mixtures used within VAEs, which can be either too restrictive or computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional spaces. We propose a novel Copula-based VAE architecture that decouples the marginal distribution of the variables from their dependence structure, offering a flexible method for representing complex, correlated posterior distributions. We provide a comprehensive comparison of three different approaches for approximating the posterior: a Gaussian Mixture with a diagonal covariance matrix, a Gaussian Mixture with a full covariance matrix, and a Gaussian Copula. Our analysis, conducted on a high-fidelity synthetic dataset, demonstrates that the Copula VAE offers a promising and tractable solution in high-dimensional spaces. Although the present work remains in the two-dimensional space, the results suggest efficient scalability to higher dimensions. It achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters than the Gaussian Mixture alternatives, whose parametrization grows prohibitively with the dimensionality. The results underscore the potential of Copula-based VAEs as a tool for uncertainty-aware damage identification in FOWT mooring systems.</description>

      <title>UniField: Joint Multi-Domain Training for Universal Surface Pressure Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerodynamic simulation of the surface pressure field around objects is crucial for many engineering problems. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional, computationally expensive CFD simulations for modeling surface pressure fields. However, data scarcity remains a fundamental challenge, limiting the application of neural networks. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate aerodynamic data from multiple subfields and conduct joint training to learn more general field representations. We consolidate five different datasets covering various fields, including automobiles, trains, aircraft, and general shapes. Facing significant data differences across different domains, we propose UniField, which employs a domain-agnostic Transformer module to extract general point cloud features and customizes domain-specific flow-conditioned adapters to adapt to the flow information in different subfields. Despite the fact that aerodynamic data from different subfields are typically governed by different equations, we compare models trained jointly on all data with those trained separately on individual datasets and find that the jointly-trained model commonly demonstrates better performance. This indicates that these data complement each other to help the model learn better flow field representations. These results highlight the potential of UniField as a universal flow field representation model and lay the foundation for broader applications of neural networks in aerodynamic analysis.</description>

      <title>Gradient GA: Gradient Genetic Algorithm for Drug Molecular Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular discovery has brought great benefits to the chemical industry. Various molecule design techniques are developed to identify molecules with desirable properties. Traditional optimization methods, such as genetic algorithms, continue to achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple molecular design benchmarks. However, these techniques rely solely on random walk exploration, which hinders both the quality of the final solution and the convergence speed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Gradient Genetic Algorithm (Gradient GA), which incorporates gradient information from the objective function into genetic algorithms. Instead of random exploration, each proposed sample iteratively progresses toward an optimal solution by following the gradient direction. We achieve this by designing a differentiable objective function parameterized by a neural network and utilizing the Discrete Langevin Proposal to enable gradient guidance in discrete molecular spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both convergence speed and solution quality, outperforming cutting-edge techniques. For example, it achieves up to a 25% improvement in the top-10 score over the vanilla genetic algorithm. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/debadyuti23/GradientGA.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Probabilistic Framework for Learning with Hard Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ProbHardE2E, a probabilistic forecasting framework that incorporates hard operational/physical constraints, and provides uncertainty quantification. Our methodology uses a novel differentiable probabilistic projection layer (DPPL) that can be combined with a wide range of neural network architectures. DPPL allows the model to learn the system in an end-to-end manner, compared to other approaches where constraints are satisfied either through a post-processing step or at inference. ProbHardE2E optimizes a strictly proper scoring rule, without making any distributional assumptions on the target, which enables it to obtain robust distributional estimates (in contrast to existing approaches that generally optimize likelihood-based objectives, which are heavily biased by their distributional assumptions and model choices); and it can incorporate a range of non-linear constraints (increasing the power of modeling and flexibility). We apply ProbHardE2E in learning partial differential equations with uncertainty estimates and to probabilistic time-series forecasting, showcasing it as a broadly applicable general framework that connects these seemingly disparate domains.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of Published Non-Uniform Axial Power Data for Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML Critical Heat Flux Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Critical heat flux (CHF) marks the onset of boiling crisis in light-water reactors, defining safe thermal-hydraulic operating limits. To support Phase II of the OECD/NEA AI/ML CHF benchmark, which introduces spatially varying power profiles, this work compiles and digitizes a broad CHF dataset covering both uniform and non-uniform axial heating conditions. Heating profiles were extracted from technical reports, interpolated onto a consistent axial mesh, validated via energy-balance checks, and encoded in machine-readable formats for benchmark compatibility.
  Classical CHF correlations exhibit substantial errors under uniform heating and degrade markedly when applied to non-uniform profiles, while modern tabular methods offer improved but still imperfect predictions. A neural network trained solely on uniform data performs well in that regime but fails to generalize to spatially varying scenarios, underscoring the need for models that explicitly incorporate axial power distributions. By providing these curated datasets and baseline modeling results, this study lays the groundwork for advanced transfer-learning strategies, rigorous uncertainty quantification, and design-optimization efforts in the next phase of the CHF benchmark.</description>

      <title>Cash Flow Underwriting with Bank Transaction Data: Advancing MSME Financial Inclusion in Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established or young businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. Firstly, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end-to-end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Thirdly, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Lastly, we intend to release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSMEs financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.</description>
