      <title>Functionality Optimization for Singlet Fission Rate Screening in the Full-Dimensional Molecular and Intermolecular Coordinate Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational chemistry, accurately predicting molecular configurations that exhibit specific properties remains a critical challenge. Its intricacies become especially evident in the study of molecular aggregates, where the light-induced functionality is tied to highly structure-dependent electronic couplings between molecules. Here, we present an efficient strategy for the targeted screening of the structural space employing a "functionality optimization" technique, in which a chosen descriptor, constrained by the ground state energy expression, is optimized. The chosen algorithmic differentiation (AD) framework allows to automatically obtain gradients without its tedious implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by identifying Perylene Bisiimide (PBI) dimer motifs with enhanced SF rate. Our findings reveal that certain structural modifications of the PBI monomer, such as helical twisting and bending, as well as slipped-rotated packing arrangements, can significantly increase the SF rate.</description>

      <title>An asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin method for massively parallel PDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is widely being used to solve hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) due to its ability to provide high-order accurate solutions in complex geometries, capture discontinuities, and exhibit high arithmetic intensity. However, the scalability of DG-based solvers is impeded by communication bottlenecks arising from the data movement and synchronization requirements at extreme scales. To address these challenges, recent studies have focused on the development of asynchronous computing approaches for PDE solvers. Herein, we introduce the asynchronous DG (ADG) method, which combines the benefits of the DG method with asynchronous computing to overcome communication bottlenecks. The ADG method relaxes the need for data communication and synchronization at a mathematical level, allowing processing elements to operate independently regardless of the communication status, thus potentially improving the scalability of solvers. The proposed ADG method ensures flux conservation and effectively addresses challenges arising from asynchrony. To assess its stability, Fourier-mode analysis is employed to examine the dissipation and dispersion behavior of fully-discrete equations that use the DG and ADG schemes along with the Runge-Kutta (RK) time integration scheme. Furthermore, an error analysis within a statistical framework is presented, which demonstrates that the ADG method with standard numerical fluxes achieves at most first-order accuracy. To recover accuracy, we introduce asynchrony-tolerant (AT) fluxes that utilize data from multiple time levels. Extensive numerical experiments were conducted to validate the performance of the ADG-AT scheme for both linear and nonlinear problems.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Zircaloy Oxidation Through Dynamic Mesh Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zircaloy cladding corrosion in Light Water Reactors (LWRs) results in the formation of an outer oxide layer and in the thinning of the metallic portion of the cladding. At the \'Ecole Polytechnique F\'ed\'erale de Lausanne (EPFL), we aim to investigate the impact of asymmetric oxide or crud layers and their feedback on thermal-hydraulics. To achieve this, we are implementing mechanistic capabilities for the treatment of corrosion within the open-source multi-dimensional code OFFBEAT. In this work, we outline our approach based on the combination of traditional laws for predicting the growth of the oxide layer with methods to dynamically modify the mesh points and topology. Specifically, our methodology employs routines available in the OpenFOAM library to add or remove layers of cells according to the growth of the oxide layer, along with a mesh motion solver to maintain mesh quality. We verify the methodologys against an analytical test case and then we demonstrate its potential for the study of non-uniform oxide distributions by modeling a simplified cladding ring with asymmetric temperature profile, mimicking the conditions of azimuthal power peaking in a Boiling Water Reactor (BWR).</description>

      <title>R-matrix with time-dependence calculations for three-sideband RABBITT in helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following up on a recent paper [Bharti et al., Phys. Rev. A 109 (2024) 023110], we compare the predictions from severalR-matrix with time-dependence calculations for a modified three-sideband version of the "reconstruction of attosecond beating by interference of two-photon transitions" (RABBITT) configuration applied to helium. Except for the special case of the threshold sideband, which appears to be very sensitive to the details of coupling to the bound Rydberg states, increasing the number of coupled states in the close-coupling expansion used to describe the ejected-electron--residual-ion interaction hardly changes the results. Consequently, the remaining discrepancies between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions are likely due to uncertainties in the experimental parameters, particularly the detailed knowledge of the laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Non-variational Quantum Combinatorial Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems. The algorithm leverages an engineered interference process achieved through repeated application of two unitaries; one inducing phase-shifts dependent on objective function values, and the other mixing phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems, namely those for which solutions are characterised by either a vector of binary variables, a vector of non-binary integer variables, or permutations (a vector of integer variables without repetition). An efficient quantum circuit implementation of the CTQW for each of these problem types is also discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through numerical simulation for randomly generated instances of the following problems (and problem sizes): weighted maxcut (18 vertices), maximum independent set (18 vertices), k-means clustering (12 datapoints, 3 clusters), capacitated facility location (12 customers, 3 facility locations), and the quadratic assignment problem (9 locations). For each problem instance, the algorithm finds a globally optimal solution with a small number of iterations.</description>

      <title>A QAOA approach with fake devices: A case study for the maximum cut in ring graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) can require considerable processing time for developers to test and debug their codes on expensive quantum devices. One avenue to circumvent this difficulty is to use the error maps of quantum devices, where a local simulator can be automatically configured to mimic an actual device backend. In our work, we evaluated some error maps of quantum devices, known as fake devices, that are freely available in the cloud. The QAOA and the problem of maximum cut in 2-regular connected graphs, known as ring of disagrees, were used as tools for the noise analysis. The approximation ratio, the expectation energy and the probability of success for this problem have been evaluated in two scenarios. First, the quantities were studied through noisy simulations using fake devices. Second, error mitigation methods such as optimization levels and translation (connectivity mapping) of the original problem were applied. These results were then compared with the analytical solution of the ring graph. The study shows that error mitigation methods were crucial in obtaining better results for the expectation value of the energy, the approximation ratio, and the probability of success for the ring graphs.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Neural Networks for Free Shear Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transformative impact of machine learning, particularly Deep Learning (DL), on scientific and engineering domains is evident. In the context of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) represent a significant innovation, enabling data-driven fluid simulations while incorporating physics-based laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs). While PINNs have demonstrated efficacy in various fluid flow scenarios, a noticeable gap exists in their application to simulate jet flows - an essential category in engineering. Jets, crucial for downburst outflow, ventilation, and heat transfer, lack comprehensive exploration through PINNs in existing literature. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the application of PINNs to simulate steady jet flows, specifically 2D planar turbulent jet flow scenarios. The novelty lies not only in adapting PINNs for simulating jet flows but also in overcoming challenges such as poor convergence during training, attributed to imbalances in loss terms. We propose a novel PINN architecture for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation of steady turbulent jet flows, without the need for turbulence models and simulation data. Additionally, an extended dynamic weighting strategy is introduced to enhance the balance of loss term contributions in the PINN, resulting in improved convergence and more accurate predictions.</description>

      <title>The Quantization Monte Carlo method for solving radiative transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Quantization Monte Carlo method to solve thermal radiative transport equations with possibly several collision regimes, ranging from few collisions to massive number of collisions per time unit. For each particle in a given simulation cell, the proposed method advances the time by replacing many collisions with sampling directly from the escape distribution of the particle. In order to perform the sampling, for each triplet of parameters (opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid, the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized (i.e., discrete) version by choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's parameters) and returning at random one quantile from the precomputed set of quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a benchmark with good results.</description>

      <title>Computing the Committor with the Committor: an Anatomy of the Transition State Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determining the kinetic bottlenecks that make transitions between metastable states difficult is key to understanding important physical problems like crystallization, chemical reactions, or protein folding. In all these phenomena, the system spends a considerable amount of time in one metastable state before making a rare but important transition to a new state. The rarity of these events makes their direct simulation challenging, if not impossible. We propose a method to explore the distribution of configurations that the system passes as it translocates from one metastable basin to another. We shall refer to this set of configurations as the transition state ensemble. We base our method on the committor function and the variational principle to which it obeys. We find the minimum of the variational principle via a self-consistent procedure that does not require any input besides the knowledge of the initial and final state. Right from the start, our procedure focuses on sampling the transition state ensemble and allows harnessing a large number of such configurations. With the help of the variational principle, we perform a detailed analysis of the transition state ensemble, ranking quantitatively the degrees of freedom mostly involved in the transition and opening the way for a systematic approach for the interpretation of simulation results and the construction of collective variables.</description>

      <title>A generalized approach for rapid entropy calculation of liquids and solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a comprehensive methodology for the fast computation of entropy across both solid and liquid phases. The proposed method utilizes a single trajectory of molecular dynamics (MD) to facilitate the calculation of entropy, which is composed of three components. The electronic entropy is determined through the temporal average acquired from density functional theory (DFT) MD simulations. The vibrational entropy, typically the predominant contributor to the total entropy, even within the liquid state, is evaluated by computing the phonon density of states via the velocity auto-correlation function. The most arduous component to quantify, the configurational entropy, is assessed by probability analysis of the local structural arrangement and atomic distribution. We illustrate, through a variety of examples, that this method is both a versatile and valid technique for characterizing the thermodynamic states of both solids and liquids. Furthermore, this method is employed to expedite the calculation of melting temperatures, demonstrating its practical utility in computational thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Active osmotic-like pressure on permeable inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a standard minimal active Brownian model to investigate the osmotic-like effective pressure generated by active fluids on fixed hollow inclusions. These inclusions are enclosed by a permeable (albeit nonflexible) membrane, and the interior and exterior regions of the inclusions have different particle motility strengths. We consider both rectangular and disklike inclusions and analyze the effects of various system parameters, such as excluded volume interaction between active particles, hardness of membrane and active particle density, on the effective pressure produced on the enclosing membrane. We focus on the range of intermediate to high motility strengths and analyze the effective pressure in the steady state. Our findings for the active pressure produced in the interior and exterior regions of the inclusion indicate that the pressure is higher in the region with lower motility due to the relatively stronger accumulation of active particles.</description>
