      <title>Testing strong-field QED to second-order in the highly correlated atomic system berylliumlike Pb78+ by electron-ion recombination spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-energy storage ring with an ultracold electron cooler has been coupled with a heavy-ion accelerator facilitating high-resolution electron-ion collision spectroscopy of the heaviest few-electron ions. In the present work resonant electron-ion recombination of berylliumlike Pb$^{78+}$ ions was measured in the collision-energy range 9.3-16.5eV and a value of 244.937(30) eV is derived for the Pb$^{78+}$($2s^2\;^1S_0 - 2s\,2p\;^3P_1$) excitation energy. This result agrees with the most recent (less accurate) theoretical value of 244.942(52) eV [Malyshev et al., Physical Review A 110, 062824 (2024)], which has been calculated by applying strong-field QED rigorously up to the second order. The present investigation suggests that further technical improvements can potentially increase the experimental accuracy by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Vibrationally highly excited trilobite molecules stabilized by non-adiabatic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the observation of highly excited ($\nu \sim 100)$ vibrational states of a trilobite ultralong-range Rydberg molecule in $^{87}$Rb. These states manifest spectroscopically in a regularly spaced series of peaks red-detuned from the $25f_{7/2}$ dissociation threshold. The existence and observed stability of these states requires the almost complete suppression of the adiabatic decay pathway induced by the $P$-wave shape resonance of Rb. This stabilization is predicted to occur only for certain Rydberg levels where the avoided crossing between trilobite and $P$-wave dominated butterfly potential energy curves nearly vanishes, allowing the vibrational states to diabatically traverse the crossing with almost unit probability. This is the first direct measurement of beyond-Born-Oppenheimer physics in long-range Rydberg molecules, and paves the way for future experiments to access and manipulate wavepackets formed from high-lying vibrational states.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized optical system for a chip based cold atom inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We miniaturized the complex optical system responsible for the cooling, pumping and imaging of an on-chip based cold atom inertial sensor. This optical bench uses bonded miniature optics and includes all the necessary optical functions. The bench has a volume of 35x25x5~cm$^3$. We developed a laser frequency lock adapted to the optical bench using saturated absorption in a rubidium cell. The entire laser source based on frequency doubling of 1.56~$\mu$m fiber lasers, including the control system and the saturated absorption module, fits in a $5U$-rack. Using the miniaturized bench, we realized two and three dimensional magneto optical traps for Rubidium 87 atoms.</description>

      <title>Projectile excitation to the $\mathbf{2s2p}$ $\mathbf{^{3}\!P}$ and $\mathbf{^{1}\!P}$ autoionizing states in swift collisions of He-like carbon and oxygen mixed-state $\mathbf{(1s^2, 1s2s\,^{3,1}S)}$ ion beams with helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of the projectile $2s2p\,^{3}\!P$ and $2s2p\,^{1}\!P$ autoionizing states is investigated in 0.5-1.5 MeV/u collisions of He-like carbon and oxygen mixed-state three-component $(1s^2,1s2s\,^{3}\!S,1s2s\,^{1}\!S)$ ion beams with helium targets. The mixed-state beams are produced in the stripping systems of the 5.5~MV Demokritos tandem accelerator. Using high-resolution Auger projectile electron spectroscopy, the normalized Auger electron yields are measured at $0^\circ$ relative to the beam direction. In addition, a three-electron atomic orbital close-coupling approach, employing full configuration interaction and antisymmetrization of the three-electron, two-center total wave function, is applied to calculate the production cross sections for these states from each of the three initial ion beam components. Thereupon, the theoretical Auger yields are computed and found to be smaller than experiment by factors ranging from about 1.2 to 7.6. Agreement, however, improves when larger $1s2s\,^{1}\!S$ fractions, not only based on spin statistics, are projected. Overall, this non-perturbative treatment of excitation, which does not rely on scaling parameters or renormalization, marks a significant advancement in the modeling of multielectron, multi-open-shell quantum systems subjected to ultrafast perturbations, where current understanding remains incomplete.</description>

      <title>Empirical formula for charge state distribution of projectile ions through solid targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charge state distributions (CSD) of projectile ions through gaseous or solid targets in the energy range of tandem accelerators (1 MeV/u &lt; E &lt; 5 MeV/u) have a major impact on ion-atom collision and accelerator physics. Theoretically, it is possible to calculate the CSD for up to Ni-like ions, but empirical models do not have such bounds. In recent decades, the mean charge states have mostly been obtained from an empirical formula [Schiwietz et al., Nucl. Inst. Meths. , 225, 4(2004)]. But no description on CSD is found there. To estimate the CSD, we have used a Gaussian distribution function having distribution width given by [Novikov and Teplove, Phys. Lett. 378, 1286(2014)]. The results obtained are compared with those obtained with the measured CSD for heavy projectile ions. The merits and demerits of such empirical formulae are discussed.</description>

      <title>High-resolution rapid-scanning Fourier-transform spectroscopy of ultracold atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond interferometry combined with acousto-optical phase modulation is an effective approach to implement various types of coherent nonlinear and multidimensional spectroscopy schemes. The high sensitivity of this method has recently enabled the study of highly dilute gaseous and ultracold quantum systems for which the attainable spectral resolution is of particular interest. Here, we directly compare the performance and spectral resolution between two experimental implementations, that are step-wise and continuous rapid scanning of the underlying Fourier transform interferometers. We show the performance advantage of the rapid-scanning approach and demonstrate a spectral resolution of 250 MHz in the spectroscopy of laser-cooled Li atoms. This is a 10-fold resolution improvement compared to previous experiments.</description>

      <title>Coherent optical two-photon resonance tomographic imaging in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging is a three-dimensional imaging technique, where a gradient of the magnetic field is used to interrogate spin resonances with spatial resolution. The application of this technique to probe the coherence of atoms with good three-dimensional resolution is a challenging application. We propose and demonstrate an optical method to probe spin resonances via a two-photon Raman transition, reconstructing the 3D-structure of an atomic ensemble's coherence, which is itself subject to external fields. Our method relies on a single time-and-space resolved heterodyne measurement, allowing the reconstruction of a complex 3D coherence profile. Owing to the optical interface, we reach a tomographic image resolution of $14\times14\times36$ $\mu\mathrm{m}^3$. The technique allows to probe any transparent medium with a resonance structure and provides a robust diagnostic tool for atom-based quantum information protocols. As such, it is a viable technique for application to magnetometry, electrometry, and imaging of electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Optimal Local Measurements in Single-Parameter Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurement plays a crucial role in quantum metrology. Due to the limitations of experimental capabilities, collectively measuring multiple copies of probing systems can present significant challenges. Therefore, the concept of locality in quantum measurements must be considered. In this work, we investigate the possibility of achieving the Quantum Cram\'er-Rao Bound (QCRB) through local measurements (LM). We first demonstrate that if there exists a LM to saturate the QCRB for qubit systems, then we can construct another rank-1 local projective measurement to saturate the QCRB. In this sense, rank-1 local projective measurements are sufficient to analyze the problem of saturating the QCRB. For pure qubits, we propose two necessary and sufficient methods to determine whether and how a given parameter estimation model can achieve QCRB through LM. The first method, dubbed iterative matrix partition method (IMP) and based on unitary transformations that render the diagonal entries of a tracless matrix vanish, elucidates the underlying mathematical structure of LM as well as the local measurements with classical communications (LMCC), generalizing the result by [Zhou et al Quantum Sci. Technol. 5, 025005 (2020)], which only holds for the later case. We clarify that the saturation of QCRB through LM for the GHZ-encoded states is actually due to the self-similar structure in this approach. The second method, dubbed hierarchy of orthogonality conditions (HOC) and based on the parametrization of rank-1 measurements for qubit systems, allows us to construct several examples of saturating QCRB, including the three-qubit W states and $N$-qubit W states ($N \geq 3$). Our findings offer insights into achieving optimal performance in quantum metrology when measurement resources are limited.</description>

      <title>Violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality for dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05304v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) serves as a criterion to determine the adherence of macroscopic system dynamics to macrorealism, as introduced by Leggett and Garg. A violation of this inequality implies either the absence of a realistic description of the system or the impossibility of noninvasive measurement. In this Letter, we investigate the violation of the LGI for the system of bosons in a double-well potential. Specifically, we explore the violation of the LGI in the dynamics of bosons in a double-well potential in the Bose-Einstein-condensation (BEC) regime, where the system can be considered as two weakly coupled Bose condensates, and in the single-particle regime to establish the conditions under which the violation of the LGI occurs. Our analysis reveals that the LGI is violated due to Josephson oscillations, while it remains unviolated in the strong coupling regime, attributed to the self-trapping phenomena. Notably, we observe that the violation of the LGI becomes increasingly significant as the particle number increases. These findings provide valuable insights into the macrorealistic behavior of Bose condensates and highlight the effect of measurements on the dynamics of a macroscopic system.</description>

      <title>CNN-Based Vortex Detection in Atomic 2D Bose Gases in the Presence of a Phononic Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play a crucial role in both equilibrium and dynamical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid systems. Experimental detection of these excitations in 2D ultracold atomic gases typically involves examining density depletions in absorption images, however the presence of a significant phononic background renders the problem challenging, beyond the capability of simple algorithms or the human eye. Here, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect vortices in the presence of strong long- and intermediate-length scale density modulations in finite-temperature 2D Bose gases. We train the model on datasets obtained from ab initio Monte Carlo simulations using the classical-field method for density and phase fluctuations, and Gross-Pitaevskii simulation of realistic expansion dynamics. We use the model to analyze experimental images and benchmark its performance by comparing the results to the matter-wave interferometric detection of vortices, confirming the observed scaling of vortex density across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) critical point. The combination of a relevant simulation pipeline with machine-learning methods is a key development towards the comprehensive understanding of complex vortex-phonon dynamics in out-of-equilibrium 2D quantum systems.</description>
