      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Population Growth and Applying Decarbonization Regulations on the Energy Market in the ERCOT Interconnection Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Texas ERCOT is experiencing rapid population growth that increases electricity demand and creates new reliability challenges. At the same time, decarbonization policies are being considered, adding uncertainty about future generation portfolios and system costs. This study evaluates how population driven load growth and proposed decarbonization regulations may affect ERCOT in 2030 using a capacity expansion model. Three population scenarios are analyzed: baseline, lower growth, and higher growth. For each scenario, additional cases introduce a CO2 emissions limit and a carbon price to assess their effects on system costs, generation mix, and non served energy.
  Results show that population growth increases total system costs and unmet demand, while storage needs and transmission transfer levels remain relatively stable. A CO2 emissions limit has almost no effect because ERCOT is already expected to meet the 2030 threshold. In contrast, carbon pricing produces a meaningful shift toward renewable generation and reduced use of natural gas, although cost impacts vary by scenario. These findings show the importance of accounting for demographic uncertainty in long term planning and suggest that carbon pricing may be a more effective decarbonization mechanism than static emissions limits. The study also provides a basis for future stochastic modeling that incorporates uncertainty in demand, renewable output, and fuel prices.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Phase transition to causal symmetry reveals operational autonomy in sociotechnical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex adaptive systems persist through continuous transformation, yet the dynamical principles governing their long-term stability remain poorly characterized. Here we analyze 50 large-scale collaborative ecosystems spanning 11,042 system-months to quantify the emergence of operational autonomy. We develop an order parameter (Gamma) measuring structural persistence amid component turnover and characterize directional coupling between organizational architecture and collective activity. Gamma exhibits a bimodal distribution (Hartigan p=0.0126; Delta BIC = 2,000), identifying two regimes: an exploratory phase of high variance and a mature phase with 1.77x variance collapse. Granger analysis reveals causal symmetrization at maturity - the structure-activity coupling ratio shifts from 0.71 (activity-driven) to 0.94 (bidirectional), indicating that architecture increasingly constrains collective coordination.
  A viability index, combining activity and structure, outperforms activity-based prediction (AUC = 0.88 vs 0.81), identifying 'zombie' systems where high churn masks structural decay. This extends recent work by Ait et al., who identified 'zombie' projects exhibiting activity without development based on non-coding contributions. Our metric identifies structural zombies: projects where coding activity persists but fails to preserve architectural invariants.
  These results establish causal symmetrization as an empirically validated signature of self-organizing autonomy applicable across complex collaborative systems - a dynamical regime previously theorized in biological contexts but here demonstrated and measured in artificial ones.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Punishment in Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a coevolutionary framework in which punishment intensity dynamically adapts to the fraction of cooperators in the population. Unlike static models, adaptive punishment reshapes the effective payoff landscape, driving transitions among canonical games, including the Prisoner's Dilemma, Harmony, Stag Hunt, and Chicken games. Analytical results reveal rich dynamical behaviors such as coexistence, bistability, limit cycle and Hopf bifurcation. These findings highlight adaptive punishment as a robust mechanism for sustaining cooperation by the coevolutionary feedback and offer insights into institutional design, ecological interactions, and social governance.</description>

      <title>Avalanches of choice: how stranger-to-stranger interactions shape crowd dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pedestrian routing choices play a crucial role in shaping collective crowd dynamics, yet the influence of interactions among unfamiliar individuals remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for identifying influential nodes in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09606v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes plays a pivotal role in understanding, controlling, and optimizing the behavior of complex systems, ranging from social to biological and technological domains. Yet most centrality-based approaches rely on pairwise topology and are purely structural, neglecting the higher-order interactions and the coupling between structure and dynamics. Consequently, the practical effectiveness of existing approaches remains uncertain when applied to complex spreading processes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified framework, Initial Propagation Score (IPS), to directly embed propagation dynamics into influence assessment on higher-order networks. We analytically derive mechanism-aware influence measures by relating the early-stage dynamics and local topological characteristics to long-term outbreak sizes, and such explicit physical context endows IPS with robustness, transferability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple dynamics and more than 20 real-world hypergraphs show that IPS consistently outperforms other leading baseline centralities. Furthermore, IPS estimates node influence with only local neighborhood information, yielding computational efficiency and scalability to large-scale networks. This work underscores the necessity of considering dynamics for reliable identification of influential nodes and provides a concise principled basis for optimizing interventions in epidemiology, information diffusion, and collective intelligence.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Independence Breeds Disruption but Limits Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive research on scientific disruption, two questions remain: why disruption has declined amid growing knowledge, and why disruptive work receives fewer and delayed citations. One way to address these questions is to identify an intrinsic, paper-level property that reliably predicts disruption and explains both patterns. Here, we propose a novel measure, knowledge independence, capturing the extent to which a paper draws on references that do not cite one another. Analyzing 114 million publications, we find that knowledge independence strongly predicts disruption and mediates the disruptive advantage of small, onsite, and fresh teams. Its long-term decline, nonreproducible by null models, provides a mechanistic explanation for the parallel decline in disruption. Causal and simulation evidence further indicates that knowledge independence drives the persistent trade-off between disruption and impact. Taken together, these findings fill a critical gap in understanding scientific innovation, revealing a universal law: Knowledge independence breeds disruption but limits recognition.</description>

      <title>An accurate mean-field equation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the emergent macroscopic behavior of dynamical systems on networks is a crucial but challenging task. One of the simplest and most effective methods to construct a reduced macroscopic model is given by mean-field theory. The resulting approximations perform well on dense and homogeneous networks but poorly on scale-free networks, which, however, are more realistic in many applications. In this paper, we introduce a modified version of the mean-field approximation for voter model dynamics on scale-free networks. The two main deviations from classical theory are that we use degree-weighted shares as coarse variables and that we introduce a correlation factor that can be interpreted as slowing down dynamics induced by interactions. We observe that the correlation factor is only a property of the network and not of the state or of parameters of the process. This approach achieves a significantly smaller approximation error than standard methods without increasing dimensionality.</description>

      <title>How Conflict Aversion Can Enable Authoritarianism: An Evolutionary Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use evolutionary game theory to examine how conflict-averse centrism can facilitate authoritarian success in polarized political conflicts. Such conflicts are often asymmetric: authoritarian actors can employ norm-breaking or coercive tactics, while democratic resistance faces stronger normative constraints on acceptable behavior. Yet formal models typically treat sides symmetrically and rarely examine conflict-averse behavior. Drawing on empirical research on protest backlash, civility norms, and authoritarian resilience, we model these dynamics as a three-strategy evolutionary game. This framework yields two outcomes -- cyclic authoritarian resurgence through a heteroclinic cycle and a stable centrist--authoritarian coalition excluding resistance -- depending on confrontation responses. We demonstrate how an established dynamical framework with empirically grounded behavioral assumptions clarifies conditions under which conflict aversion can diminish the effectiveness of democratic resistance.</description>

      <title>Critical Thresholds in Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions for Epidemic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as contact tracing and social distancing, are critical for controlling epidemic outbreaks, yet their dynamic interactions remain underexplored. We introduce a probabilistic framework to analyze the synergy between contact tracing speed, quantified by the contact tracing period $\tau$, and the average number of close contacts, $\bar{k}_+$, reflecting social distancing measures. We identify critical thresholds ($R=1$) that separate pandemic and contained phases in the $\bar{k}_{+}-\tau$ plane, validated using high-resolution data from Shenzhen's 2022 Omicron outbreak (1,187 cases, 86,451 contacts). Our findings show that contact tracing alone can contain diseases with $R_0 &lt; 2.12$ (95% CI 2.07-2.16), covering 43.33% of major infectious diseases, while combining with social distancing extends control to $R_0 &lt; 7.82$ (95% CI 7.70-7.93), encompassing 86.67% of pathogens. These results, supported by empirical data, highlight the efficacy of rapid tracing and targeted social distancing as alternatives to mass PCR testing. Our framework offers actionable insights for optimizing NPI strategies, though challenges in scaling to regions with higher tracing miss rates or weaker infrastructure underscore the need for adaptive, data-driven policies.</description>

      <title>Phase locking and multistability in the topological Kuramoto model on cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>
