      <title>Single-Shot Multispectral Encoding: Advancing Optical Lithography for Encryption and Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most modern optical display and sensing devices utilize a limited number of spectral units within the visible range, based on human color perception. In contrast, the rapid advancement of machine-based pattern recognition and spectral analysis could facilitate the use of multispectral functional units, yet the challenge of creating complex, high-definition, and reproducible patterns with an increasing number of spectral units limits their widespread application. Here, we report a technique for optical lithography that employs a single-shot exposure to reproduce perovskite films with spatially controlled optical band gaps through light-induced compositional modulations. Luminescent patterns are designed to program correlations between spatial and spectral information, covering the entire visible spectral range. Using this platform, we demonstrate multispectral encoding patterns for encryption and multivariate optical converters for dispersive optics-free spectroscopy with high spectral resolution. The fabrication process is conducted at room temperature and can be extended to other material and device platforms.</description>

      <title>Modeling Optical Key Distribution over a Satellite-to-Ground Link Under Weak Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the secret key capacity of intensity modulation/direct detection optical key distribution (IM/DD OKD) for a free-space optical (FSO) link between a low-Earth orbit satellite and an optical ground station. Focusing on downlink communication, we account for atmospheric turbulence, which causes random variations in the transmittance of the FSO channel. We implement an atmospheric channel model that accounts for absorption and scattering, geometric losses, pointing errors, and intensity fluctuations. The secret key capacity is quantified under different noise scenarios and reconciliation code efficiencies, assuming a hard decoding scheme. The performance of the IM/DD OKD protocol is compared under direct and reverse reconciliation regimes. Additionally, we examine the impact of weak and strong wind on the strength of atmospheric turbulence, leading to different results of the secret key capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of error distributions that arise from protocol optimization. Our results provide insights into optimizing IM/DD OKD protocols for varying atmospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>Acoustic wave modulation of gap plasmon cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of metallic nanostructures in nanophotonics is expected expand if ways to electrically manipulate their optical resonances at high speed can be identified. Here, we capitalize on electrically-driven surface acoustic waves and the extreme light concentration afforded by gap plasmons to achieve this goal. We place gold nanoparticles in a particle-on-mirror configuration with a few-nanometer-thick, compressible polymer spacer. Surface acoustic waves are then used to tune light scattering at speeds approaching the GHz regime. We observe evidence that the surface acoustic waves produce mechanical deformations in the polymer, and that ensuing nonlinear mechanical dynamics leads to unexpectedly large levels of strain and spectral tuning. Our approach provides a design strategy for electrically-driven dynamic metasurfaces and fundamental explorations of high-frequency, polymer dynamics in ultra-confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal shaping of broadband helical light pulses at relativistic intensities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal control of laser pulses at relativistic intensities is a longstanding goal with broad implications in laser-plasma acceleration, high-brightness radiation sources, and extreme-field science. Laser pulses with helical spatiotemporal intensity profiles, often referred to as light springs, carry multiple spectral and orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, producing a rotating intensity profile capable of coupling directly to helical plasma waves. Until now, light springs have only been realized on low-power systems, limited by optical damage thresholds and large-aperture beamline constraints. Here, we report the first experimental realization of light springs at relativistic intensities, achieving peak intensities above $1.4\times10^{18}$ W/cm$^{2}$. Our approach spectrally splits a high-power laser pulse, imprints distinct helical phases on each component, and coherently recombines them. Hyperspectral imaging, off-axis holography, and spectral phase reconstruction confirm excellent agreement with theory and reveal the potential to drive superluminal rotational velocities. Introducing spectral chirp demonstrates further control of the temporal evolution of the transverse mode structure. This platform opens new regimes of ultra-intense laser-plasma interaction where laser OAM can directly couple to plasma OAM.</description>

      <title>Efficient high-quality photon pair generation in modal phase-matched thin-film lithium niobate micro-ring resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient generation of high-quality photon pairs is essential for modern quantum technologies. Micro-ring resonator is an ideal platform for studying on-chip photon sources due to strong nonlinear effect, resonant-enhanced optical fields, and high integration. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) micro-ring resonators with periodically poled quasi-phase matching have shown high-quality photon pair generation. However, periodic poling technology remains expensive and requires complex fabrication hindering its scalability and capability for practical application in nonlinear photonic devices. To address this, we propose a scalable approach using TFLN micro-ring resonators based on modal phase matching to achieve cost-effective, efficient high-quality photon-pair generation, significantly simplifying fabrication. We achieved pair generation rates up to 40.2 MHz/mW through spontaneous parametric down-conversion, with coincidence-to-accidental ratios exceeding 1200. By combining micro-ring resonance enhancement with modal phase matching, our approach reduces device size and fabrication cost while maintaining high nonlinear efficiency. These results advance the development of compact, efficient on-chip photon sources for next-generation nonlinear and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Light-Addressable Smart Nanostructures via Resonant Nanoheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective spatial control of chemical reactions at the level of individual nanostructures remains a significant challenge. We introduce a light-activated system that combines plasmonic gold nanorods with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) monolayer to gate surface reactivity based on each rod's geometry under optical illumination. Laser excitation tuned to a rod's plasmon resonance and polarization collapses the polymer into a compact shell on that rod, blocking reactive head groups and creating a long-lived, kinetically trapped inert state stable for days. During this interval, orthogonal chemical transformations can be performed on adjacent, unilluminated rods without interference. Subsequent diffusion-limited rehydration restores the swollen brush conformation and renews surface activity, effectively erasing the chemical memory. Numerical simulations based on real nanorod geometries confirm that switching selectivity follows the rods' absorption profiles. This mask-free, fully reversible strategy turns passive polymer films into dynamic chemical interfaces, offering a route to high-resolution patterning and on-demand control of nanoscale reactions for electronic and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously integrated lithium tantalate-on-silicon nitride modulators for high-speed communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the prospects of higher bandwidths for optical interconnects, integrated modulators involving materials beyond those available in silicon manufacturing increasingly rely on the Pockels effect. For instance, wafer-scale bonding of lithium niobate films onto ultralow loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits provides heterogeneous integrated devices with low modulation voltages operating at higher speeds than silicon photonics. However, in spite of its excellent electro-optic modulation capabilities, lithium niobate suffers from drawbacks such as birefringence and long-term bias instability. Among other available electro-optic materials, lithium tantalate can overcome these shortcomings with its comparable electro-optic coefficient, significantly improved photostability, low birefringence, higher optical damage threshold, and enhanced DC bias stability. Here, we demonstrate wafer-scale heterogeneous integration of lithium tantalate films on low-loss silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits. With this hybrid platform, we implement modulators that combine the ultralow optical loss ($\sim$ 14.2 dB/m), mature processing and wide transparency of silicon nitride waveguides with the ultrafast electro-optic response of thin-film lithium tantalate. The resulting devices achieve a 6 V half-wave voltage, and support modulation bandwidths of up to 100 GHz. We use single intensity modulators and in-phase/quadrature (IQ) modulators to transmit PAM4 and 16-QAM signals reaching up to 333 and 581 Gbit/second net data rates, respectively. Our results demonstrate that lithium tantalate is a viable approach to broadband photonics sustaining extended optical propagation, which can uniquely contribute to technologies such as RF photonics, interconnects, and analog signal processors.</description>

      <title>High contrast few-cycle frontend with hybrid amplification for petawatt-class lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 10 mJ-class laser system for seeding petawatt-class Ti:Sa lasers based on a hybrid, femtosecond optical parametric and negatively chirped Ti:Sa-based amplification architecture. Output pulses with 13 mJ energy, 14.4 fs transform limited duration, and high spatio-spectral quality are reached at 100 Hz repetition rate centered at 788 nm wavelength. By compressing 1 mJ energy with bulk glass and positively chirped mirrors, a pulse duration of 15.5 fs is measured. The intensity contrast is higher than 10$^{12}$ already 15 ps before the main pulse. The presented architecture can be a robust and reliable solution for seeding sub-17 fs high intensity lasers with ultrahigh contrast at up to 100 Hz repetition rate.</description>

      <title>Structural and Optical Properties of Crystal Ion Sliced BaTiO$_3$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a compelling material for integrated photonics due to its strong electro-optic and second-order nonlinear properties. Crystal Ion Slicing (CIS) presents a scalable and CMOS-compatible route for fabricating thin BaTiO$_3$ films; however, ion implantation during CIS introduces lattice damage that can degrade structural and optical performance. In this study, we demonstrate that post-slicing thermal annealing effectively restores the structural integrity and optical quality of CIS-processed BaTiO$_3$ flakes. Raman spectroscopy confirms the recovery of crystallinity, while second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveals systematic reorientation of ferroelectric domains and restoration of the associated second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor $X^{(2)}$. Notably, SHG signals persist even in regions with weak Raman signatures, indicating that long-range ferroelectric order can survive despite partial lattice disruption. Optical measurements show that the linear dispersion of annealed CIS flakes closely matches that of bulk BaTiO$_3$, validating their suitability for photonic integration. Together, these results qualify CIS - combined with thermal annealing - as a viable and scalable manufacturing strategy for high-quality BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator (BTOI) platforms, enabling advanced integrated photonic devices for modulation, frequency conversion, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Aspheric lens design proposal for near-perfect mode-matching of a broadband quantum dot micropillar to a single-mode fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots in micropillars are one of the most promising options for a bright, deterministic single photon source. While highly efficient devices (&gt;95%) have been designed, there remains a significant bottleneck that impacts the overall system efficiency: the large numerical aperture of the output mode. This leads to inefficient coupling of emitted photons into single-mode fibre, thus limiting practical integration into quantum computing and communication architectures. We show that with the addition of a well designed aspheric SiO2 microlens we can decrease the mode-matching losses to a SMF from 83.1% to &lt;0.1(0.1)%. This can result in a single photon source design with 96.4(0.1)% end-to-end efficiency, paving the way for scalable photonic quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Supercoherence: Harnessing Long-Range Interactions to Preserve Collective Coherence in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial quantum systems with synthetic dimensions enable exploring novel quantum phenomena difficult to create in conventional materials. These synthetic degrees of freedom increase the system's dimensionality without altering its physical structure, accessing higher-dimensional physics in lower-dimensional setups. However, synthetic quantum systems often suffer from intrinsic disorder, causing rapid decoherence that limits scalability, a major obstacle in quantum information science. Here, we show that introducing just a few long-range interactions can mitigate decoherence, creating persistent collective coherence in highly symmetric collective excited states. We term this universal phenomenon "supercoherence" and show its exceptional robustness against disorder up to a dynamical phase transition at critical interaction strength and disorder. Supercoherence stabilizes not only coherence but also all other quantum properties of the states, challenging traditional views on the inevitability of decoherence in disordered interacting quantum systems and suggesting new opportunities for quantum memory and information processing.</description>

      <title>Cavity-based optical switching via phase modulation in warm rubidium vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical switching remains a key outstanding challenge for scalable fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing due to the trade-off between speed, bandwidth, and loss. Scalable quantum photonics demands all three, to enable high computational clock rates and resource efficient scaling to large systems. We present a cavity-based optical switch that overcomes this limitation, demonstrating 22 ns rise time, insertion loss of 2.4 dB, and 17.5 dB extinction ratio. All-optical control is achieved via phase modulation of a signal field detuned from the near-degenerate two-photon absorption ladder in warm rubidium vapor. The ultimate performance of our switch, combining both speed and efficiency, will find applications in active multiplexing, loop-based quantum memory, and feedforward for quantum error-correction protocols.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.</description>

      <title>Exploring the feasibility of probabilistic and deterministic quantum gates between T centers in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T center defects in silicon provide an attractive platform for quantum technologies due to their unique spin properties and compatibility with mature silicon technologies. We investigate several gate protocols between single T centers, including two probabilistic photon interference-based schemes, a near-deterministic photon scattering gate, and a deterministic magnetic dipole-based scheme. In particular, we study a photon interference-based scheme with feedback which can achieve success probabilities above 50%, and use the photon-count decomposition method to perform the first analytical calculations of its entanglement fidelity and efficiency while accounting for imperfections. We also calculate the fidelity and efficiency of the other schemes. Finally, we compare the performance of all the schemes, considering current and near-future experimental capabilities. In particular, we find that the photon interference-based scheme with feedback has the potential to achieve competitive efficiency and fidelity, making it interesting to explore experimentally.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Raman Spectroscopy with Tunable Visible Broadband Probe Pulse Generated by Kerr-Instability Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19080v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Femtosecond, broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy is a popular approach to measuring molecular dynamics with excellent signal-to-noise and spectral resolution. We present a new method for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy that employs Kerr-instability amplification to amplify the supercontinuum spectrum from sapphire and create a highly tunable Raman probe spectrum spanning from 530 to 1000 nm (-6000 to 2800 cm^(-1)). Our method, called Kerr-instability amplification for broadband stimulated Raman spectroscopy (KAB-SRS) provides an alternative to optical parametric amplifiers by producing a broader and more tunable spectrum at a significantly reduced cost to OPA implementations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KAB-SRS by measuring the stimulated Raman loss spectrum of 1-decanol.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach towards Atomically-precise Localization in Fluorescence Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized the imaging of complex physical and biological systems by surpassing the Abbe diffraction limit. Recent advancements, particularly in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), have pushed localization below nanometer precision, by applying prior knowledge of correlated fluorescence emission from single emitters. However, achieving a refinement from 1 nm to 1 Angstrom demands a hundred-fold increase in collected photon signal. This quadratic resource scaling imposes a fundamental barrier in SMLM, where the intense photon collection is challenged by photo-bleaching, prolonged integration times, and inherent practical constraints. Here, we break this limit by harnessing the periodic nature of the atomic lattice structure. Applying this discrete grid imaging technique (DIGIT) in a quantum emitter system, we observe an exponential collapse of localization uncertainty once surpassing the host crystal's atomic lattice constant. We further applied DIGIT to a large-scale quantum emitter array, enabling parallel positioning of each emitter through wide-field imaging. Collectively, these advancements establish DIGIT as a competitive tool for achieving unprecedented, precise measurements, ultimately paving the way to direct optical resolution of crystal and atomic features within quantum and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the degenerate optical parametric oscillations threshold in bichromatically pumped microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated microring resonators have a broad range of applications in diverse fields with the potential to design compact, robust, energy-efficient devices crucial for quantum applications. Degenerate optical parametric oscillations (DOPOs) realized in dual-pumped microring resonator with third-order optical nonlinearity are of special interest. They demonstrate both bistability of the phase of the excited signal mode and generation of nonclassical light, which can be used for coherent photonic computing. Using coupled mode equations, we perform a comprehensive numerical analysis of DOPO conditions with normal group velocity dispersion and with bichromatic pumping. Through analytical and numerical approaches, we identify optimal setup parameter values that minimize the threshold power, highlighting the importance of considering the full spectrum of mode interactions. Additionally, we show that dispersion engineering, achievable in photonic molecules or photonic crystal microresonators, may provide a targeted frequency shift of specific microresonator modes resulting in pump power threshold reduction.</description>

      <title>Optoelectronic Physical Unclonable Functions and Reservoir-Inspired Computation with Low Symmetry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structural symmetry in photonics has long been exploited to engineer devices with predictable, analytically describable behaviors. Yet this predictability often limits their expressivity, constraining complex interactions essential for advanced functionalities in computing, sensing, and security. Here we demonstrate how low symmetry integrated photonic circuits can unlock enhanced mode diversity and rich spectral complexity, enabling highly non-linear transformations of input signals into outputs. Our devices, physically unclonable moir\'e quasicrystal interferometers integrated on a silicon photonics platform, exhibit aperiodic and reconfigurable spectral responses and are characterized by analyticity breaking and erasable mutual information. Using dynamic thermo-optic control to drive their complex spectral dynamics, we demonstrate that these devices function as reconfigurable physical unclonable functions (rPUFs). We also highlight their ability to perform high-dimensional input--output transformations, emulating reservoir-inspired information processing in a compact photonic platform. This work bridges the gap between engineered and natural complexity in photonic systems, revealing new opportunities for scalable, energy-efficient, and information-dense opto-electronics with applications in secure communications, hardware security, advanced sensing, and optical information processing. Our results establish low-symmetry integrated photonics as a powerful resource for complex signal manipulation in photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Interferometric sorting of temporal Hermite-Gauss modes via temporal Gouy phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a device consisting of $m$ Mach-Zehnder interferometers and realizing sorting of first $2^m$ temporal Hermite-Gauss modes of light passing though it by adjusting the accumulated temporal Gouy phase acquired by every mode. This mode-order-dependent phase shift is achieved by a fractional Fourier transform realized by a time lens in one of interferometer's arms. We consider application of such a sorter with just two interferometers to sorting the Schmidt modes of a photon pair generated in spontaneous parametric downconversion and find the theoretical lower bond on the cross-talk probability of 5.5%.</description>

      <title>Dispersion Characteristics of a Glide-Symmetric Square Patch Metamaterial with Giant Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dispersion characteristics of a highly anisotropic metamaterial comprised of metal square patches arranged in a glide symmetry pattern and submerged in vacuum. Theoretical formulas are proposed to describe the electromagnetic tensors of a corresponding uniaxial effective medium with dielectric and magnetic responses. In addition, this work employs theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to examine the interaction between the metamaterial and electromagnetic waves across a broad spectral range. Band diagrams and isofrequency contours show good agreement between theoretical and numerical results for low frequencies and certain directions of propagation at higher frequencies. The ease of designing the metamaterial structure for various applications is facilitated by the derived theoretical formulas, which enable accurate prediction of the electromagnetic response across a wide range of frequencies based on geometric parameters.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.</description>
