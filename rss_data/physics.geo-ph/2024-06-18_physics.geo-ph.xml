      <title>A comparative study on the self-similarity hypothesis of regular and slow earthquake growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault ruptures of regular earthquakes typically grow in a self-similar manner, where the radiated energy is proportional to the seismic moment. Their proportionality factor, termed as scaled energy, has been conventionally described as the ratio of stress drop to stiffness. By analyzing the self-similar circular crack model by Sato and Hirasawa (1973), Matsu'ura (2024) found a correction prefactor for this theoretical representation of the scaled energy, the cubed ratio of the rupture speed to the S-wave speed. The stress drop times the cubed rupture speed is the scaling prefactor of the self-similar seismic moment, and thus, Matsu'ura's solution tells that the seismic moment rate is determined by the scaled energy in the self-similar rupture growth. We rearrange the properties of the self-similar solution from this perspective, apply this Sato-Hirasawa-Matsu'ura relation to a series of seismic events thought to be self-similar, and estimate their source parameters and scaled energies. According to our estimation using the above self-similarity model, seismologically detected low-frequency and very-low-frequency earthquakes have a common scaled energy, while geodetically detectable slow slip events indicate multiple modes with different scaled energies. Meanwhile, for very-low-frequency earthquakes and tectonic tremors, the seismic moments were significantly smaller than expected for self-similar ruptures despite their moments being proportional to cubed duration values. It keeps alive a hitherto less contemplated possibility: the proportionality of the moment to cubed duration may not be a manifestation of the self-similarity for slow earthquake rupture growth.</description>

      <title>Full rotational dynamics of plastic microfibers in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motion, settling, and dispersion of microplastics in the ocean are determined by their rotational dynamics. We present experiments on elongated, large aspect ratio, and mildly curved plastic fibers slightly longer than the Kolmogorov length scale. Exploiting their uniquely identifiable three dimensional orientation, we perform original optical Lagrangian investigations and provide a set of homogeneous data on their rotation rates around their longitudinal axis -- spinning rate -- and transversal axes -- tumbling rates -- which we explain in the context of the general features of turbulence.</description>

      <title>First experimental observation of zonal flows in the optimized stellarator Wendelstein 7-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first experimental evidence of the presence of zonal flow (ZF) structures in the optimized stellarator Wendelstein 7-X. Using an assortment of diagnostics, flux surface-uniform, electrostatic flow oscillations have been measured, showing a radial scale in the range of tens of ion gyroradii. Such measurements show remarkable agreement with the ZF predicted by local and global non-linear gyrokinetic simulations. These results represent the first direct measurement of ZF in a large stellarator, suitable for the validation of models in reactor relevant conditions.</description>

      <title>DiuSST: A conceptual model of diurnal warm layers for idealized atmospheric simulations with interactive SST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07933v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diurnal variability of sea surface temperature (SST) may play an important role for cloud organization above the tropical ocean, with implications for precipitation extremes, storminess, and climate sensitivity. Recent cloud-resolving simulations demonstrate how imposed diurnal SST oscillations can strongly, and delicately, impact mesoscale convective organization. In spite of this nuanced interaction, many idealized modeling studies of tropical convection either assume a constant, homogeneous SST or, in case of a responsive sea surface, represent the upper ocean by a slab with fixed thickness. Here we show that slab ocean models with constant heat capacity fail to capture the wind-dependence of observed diurnal sea surface warming. To alleviate this shortcoming, we present a simple, yet explicitly depth-resolved model of upper-ocean temperature dynamics under atmospheric forcing. Our modular scheme describes turbulent mixing as diffusion with a wind-dependent diffusivity, in addition to a bulk mixing term and heat fluxes entering as sources and sinks. Using observational data, we apply Bayesian inference to calibrate the model. In contrast with a slab model, our model captures the exponential reduction of the diurnal warming amplitude with increasing wind speed. Further, our model performs comparably to a more elaborately parameterized diurnal warm layer model. Formulated as a single partial differential equation with three key tuning parameters, the model is suitable as an interactive numerical boundary condition for idealized atmospheric simulations.</description>
