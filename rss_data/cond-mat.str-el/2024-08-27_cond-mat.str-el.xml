      <title>I-centered vs F-centered orthorhombic symmetry and negative thermal expansion of the charge density wave of EuAl2Ga2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Together with EuGa4 and EuAl4, EuAl2Ga2 belongs to the BaAl4 structure type with space group symmetry I4/mmm. EuAl2Ga2 develops an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) at temperatures below TCDW = 51 K. On the basis of temperature dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) data, the incommensurately modulated CDW crystal structure of EuAl2Ga2 is determined to possess orthorhombic superspace symmetry Immm(00g)s00. This symmetry is different from the orthorhombic Fmmm based symmetry of the CDW state of EuAl4. Nevertheless, both symmetries Immm(00g)s00 and Fmmm(00g)s00 lead to the same conclusion, that the CDW is supported by the layers of Al1 type atoms, while the Eu and Al2 or Ga atoms are not directly involved in CDW formation. The different symmetries of the CDW states of EuAl4 and EuAl2Ga2, as well as the observation of negative thermal expansion in the CDW state of EuAl2Ga2 might be explained by the effects of Ga substitution in the latter compound.</description>

      <title>Unusual energy spectra of matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the simulation of ground states of strongly-correlated quantum systems, the decomposition of an approximate solution into the exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian -- the energy spectrum of the state -- determines crucial aspects of the simulation's performance. For example, in approaches based on imaginary-time evolution, the spectrum falls off exponentially with the energy, ensuring rapid convergence. Here we consider the energy spectra of approximate matrix product state ground states, such as those obtained with the density matrix renormalization group. Despite the high accuracy of these states, contributions to the spectra are roughly constant out to surprisingly high energy, with an increase in bond dimension reducing the amplitude but not the extent of these high-energy tails. The unusual spectra, which appear to be a general feature of compressed wavefunctions, have a strong effect on sampling-based methods, yielding large fluctuations. For example, estimating the energy variance using sampling performs much more poorly than one might expect. Bounding the most extreme samples makes the variance estimate much less noisy but introduces a strong bias. However, we find that this biased variance estimator is an excellent surrogate for the variance when extrapolating the ground-state energy, and this approach outperforms competing extrapolation methods in both accuracy and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Relationship between spinons and magnetic fields in a fractionalized state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4d-electron trimer lattice Ba4Nb1-xRu3+xO12 is believed to feature a universal heavy spinon Fermi surface that underpins both a quantum spin liquid (QSL) and an adjacent heavy-fermion strange metal (HFSM), depending on Nb content; the itinerant spinons as heat carriers render the charge-insulating QSL a much better thermal conductor than the HFSM [1]. Here we report that application of a magnetic field up to 14 T surprisingly breaks the signature temperature-linearity of the heat capacity of both phases below 150 mK, inducing a rapid rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000%, whereas the AC magnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity show little response up to 14 T in the same milli-Kelvin temperature range. Furthermore, the magnetic field readily suppresses the thermal conductivity, and more strongly with decreasing temperature below 4 K by up to 40%. All these complex thermal phenomena indicate a powerful simplifying principle: Application of a magnetic field adversely weakens the itineracy of spinons and eventually destroys it with decreasing temperature, leading to an unprecedented quantum state featuring the astonishing rise in the heat capacity, thus entropy in the most unlikely circumstances of milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields. We present and discuss possible explanations.</description>

      <title>Magnetization oscillations in a periodically driven transverse field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the magnetization in an Ising chain subjected to a slowly rotating transverse field. The magnetization oscillations are found to be explained by the contributions from different particle excitations in the quantum $E_8$ model. We study the magnetization in the frequency domain in detail, uncovering a series of singular peaks for the $z$ (Ising) component. These singular peaks are split into two sets for the magnetization along $x$ and $y$ directions with frequency shifts set by the rotational-field frequency. The peaks include both $\delta$-function type and edge-singularity type peaks. The $\delta$-function peaks can be attributed to particle excitations involving an $E_8$ particle with either the vacuum or a different particle. The edge-singularity peaks are contributed by particle excitations of two $E_8$ particles with either the vacuum or another particle, or by particle excitations that contain two sets of two particles with each set including at least a particle of the same type. We propose a Rydberg qubit array for possible experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and long-range magnetic ordering in NiO tuned by pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory method we revisit the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the prototypical correlated insulator NiO. We study the pressure-induced evolution of the electronic structure, magnetic state, and exchange couplings of the antiferromagnetic phase of NiO. We calculate the ordered magnetic moments and uniform spin susceptibility of the Ni $3d$ states of NiO, which allow us to determine the pressure-dependence of the N\'eel temperature $T_N$. We note that the long-range magnetism has no significant effects on the valence band photoemission spectra of NiO under moderate compressions, implying the importance of correlations effects to explain the insulating state of NiO. The antiferromagnetic insulating state is found to be stable up to the high compression value $\sim$0.4 $V_0$ (assuming the cubic $B1$ crystal structure of NiO), and is associated with a (correlated-assisted) Slater insulating state driven by the long-range magnetic ordering. In fact, the paramagnetic phase of NiO at such high compression is found to be metallic, implying delocalization of the Ni $3d$ states. The calculated $T_N$ exhibits a non-monotonic behavior upon compression, with a maximum associated with the crossover from Mott localized (strong coupling) to itinerant moment regimes, in qualitative agreement with the phase diagram of the half-filled single-band Hubbard model. We point out the importance of the non-local correlation effects to explain the magnetic properties of NiO.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and topological phases in correlated altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a two-dimensional Hubbard model adapted to host altermagnetic states. Utilizing Hartree-Fock (HF) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we uncover that the magnetic solutions of this model feature Dirac points in their spectrum. HF predicts a gap opening at a critical interaction strength, a result corroborated by DMFT calculations at zero temperature. However, at finite temperature and high interaction strengths, Dirac points re-emerge at high energies in the spectral function, even if they are absent in the non-interacting and HF-predicted band structures. Analytical arguments reveal that this phenomenon arises near Mott insulating solutions from the frequency dependence of the self-energy, a behavior not captured by static mean-field theory. We also propose perturbations to the model that can induce a topological gap in the spectrum, leading to a transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial states by varying doping, interaction strength, and temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically calculate the dynamic structure factor of the simplest two dimensional $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory. This provides an important benchmark for future experiments which will explore the dynamics of such models. As would be expected, the spectrum is gapped away from the critical point, and can be understood in terms of the elementary excitations.</description>

      <title>Interplay between topology and interactions in superconducting chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies of non-trivial topological systems are carried out in non-interacting models that admit an exact solution. This raises the question, to which extent the consideration of electronic correlations, present in real systems, modify these results. Exact solutions of correlated electronic systems with non-trivial topological properties, although fundamental are scarce. Among the non-interacting soluble models, we single out the Kitaev p-wave superconducting chain. It plays a crucial role in clarifying the appearance of emergent quasi-particles, the Majorana modes, associated with non-trivial topological properties. Given the relevance of this model, it would be extremely useful if it can be extended to include correlations and still remain solvable. In this work we investigate a superconducting Kitaev chain that interacts through a Falicov-Kimball Hamiltonian with a background of localized electrons. For some relevant values of the parameters of this extended model solutions can be obtained, which allows for a detailed study of the interplay between electronic correlations and non-trivial topological behavior. Besides, the random occupation of the chain by the local moments brings the new interesting effects associated with disorder.</description>

      <title>Phases and phase transitions in a dimerized spin-$\mathbf{\frac{1}{2}}$ XXZ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of the dimerized XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with nearest-neighbor couplings which was studied numerically in Phys. Rev. B 106, L201106 (2022). The model has isotropic $XY$ couplings which have a uniform value and $ZZ$ couplings which have a dimerized form, with strengths $J_a$ and $J_b$ on alternate bonds. We find a rich phase diagram in the region of positive $J_a, ~J_b$. We provide a detailed understanding of the different phases and associated quantum phase transitions using a combination of mean-field theory, low-energy effective Hamiltonians, renormalization group calculations employing the technique of bosonization, and numerical calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. The phase diagram consists of two Ising paramagnetic phases called IPM$_0$ and IPM$_\pi$, and a phase with Ising Neel order called IN; all these phases are gapped. The phases IPM$_0$ and IPM$_\pi$ are separated by a gapless phase transition line given by $0 \le J_a = J_b \le 1$ which is described by a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$. There are two gapless phase transition lines separating IPM$_0$ from IN and IPM$_\pi$ from IN; these are described by conformal field theories with $c=\frac{1}{2}$ corresponding to quantum Ising transitions. The $c=1$ line bifurcates into the two $c=\frac{1}{2}$ lines at the point $J_a = J_b = 1$; the shape of the bifurcation is found analytically using RG calculations. A symmetry analysis shows that IPM$_0$ is a topologically trivial phase while IPM$_\pi$ is a time-reversal symmetry-protected topological phase (SPT) with spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ states at the two ends of an open system. The numerical results obtained by the DMRG method are in good agreement with the analytical results. Finally we propose experimental platforms for testing our results.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric signature of quantum criticality in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeRhIn$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the Fermi surface across the quantum critical point (QCP), which is relevant for characterizing the quantum criticality and understanding its relation with unconventional superconductivity, is an intriguing subject in the study of strongly correlated electron systems. In this study, we report the thermopower measurements to investigate a change in Fermi surface across the QCP in pure and 4.4% Sn-doped CeRhIn$_5$. Results show that their thermopower behavior differs significantly in the vicinity of their respective pressure-induced QCP. In pure CeRhIn$_5$, a drastic collapse of the thermopower takes place at the Kondo breakdown QCP, where the Fermi surface reconstructs concurrently with the development of the magnetic order. By contrast, the thermopower exhibits a broadly symmetric behavior around the QCP in 4.4% Sn-doped CeRhIn$_5$, which is a characteristic of the spin-density-wave QCP. These observations are consistent with the theoretical expectations and suggest the effectiveness of thermopower measurement in discriminating the nature of quantum criticality in heavy-fermion systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-triplet pair density wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that the nonzero center of mass momentum pair density wave (PDW) is a widespread phenomenon observed over different superconducting materials. However, concrete theoretical model realizations of the PDW order have remained elusive. Here, we study a one-dimensional model with nearest-neighbor pairing attraction, i.e. a spinful Kitaev chain, under generic spin-orbit couplings such that the spin-rotation symmetry is fully broken. The most general superconducting order parameter is described by a spatial dependent $\mathbf{d}_i$-vector. We show that a spin-triplet pair density wave (t-PDW) emerges in the ground state and occupies a large part of the phase diagram. The $\mathbf{d_i}$-vector of the t-PDW rotates with a pitch $Q_{\rm pdw}$ along the chain and spans an ellipsoid. The pure t-PDW is fully-gapped and a class-DIII topological superconductor with two Majorana zero modes localized at each end of the chain and protected by time-reversal symmetry. Our findings reveal unprecedented insights into the exotic pure PDW superconductor and provide a possible explanation for the one-dimensional PDW detected along domain walls in monolayer iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se) and potentially realizable using other quantum structures in unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Towards All Categorical Symmetries in 2+1 Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the most general gauging operations in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories with finite symmetry groups, which correspond to gapped boundary conditions in 3+1 dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. The classification is achieved by enumerating 2+1 dimensional oriented topological quantum field theories that cancel the 't Hooft anomaly associated with the symmetry. This framework is rigorously formulated using twisted crossed extensions of modular fusion categories and projective 3-representations. Additionally, we explore the resulting fusion 2-category symmetries and argue that this framework captures all possible categorical symmetries in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories.</description>

      <title>Possible Fano effect and suppression of Andreev reflection in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently-discovered high-temperature superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure has stimulated intensive debates. Key controversies concern interlayer versus intralayer pairing scenarios and if the hybridization plays a key role in establishing the superconductivity. But experimental clarification is difficult due to the limitation of employing state-of-the-art techniques under high pressure. Here we propose that quasiparticle tunneling and Andreev reflection on a normal metal-superconductor junction may provide a feasible way to distinguish different pairing scenarios. We predict that an asymmetric Fano line shape may be induced by the hybridization between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ metallic bands and the strongly renormalized flat $d_{z^2}$ quasiparticle bands. In the superconducting state, we show that the Andreev reflection should be greatly suppressed for interlayer pairing superconductivity with a small interlayer hopping. We propose future experiments to examine these predictions and help clarify the fundamental physics of superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity emerging along with the strange-metal behavior in UAs2 under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14334v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered spin-triplet superconductor candidate UTe2 with Tc = 2 K has attracted enormous attention because it possesses many interesting properties, such as the extremely high upper critical field Hc2(0), chiral superconductivity and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, etc., all these suggest that it may be the long-sought spin-triplet superconductor. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity up to Tc = 4K in one of its siblings, i.e., UAs2 under high pressures. Interestingly, the UAs2 shows metallic behavior with an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at about 274 K under ambient pressure. Upon applying pressure, this transition is pushed down to lower temperatures with improved electric conductivity. When the pressure rises to about 20-22 GPa, superconductivity occurs together with the emergence of a linear temperature dependence of normal state resistance, the latter is a hallmark of the strange-metal state. The superconductivity with the highest Tc = 4 K is reached under a pressure of about 26.8 GPa, and it is robust against magnetic field with the upper critical field {\mu}0Hc2(0) ~ 12 T, far beyond the Pauli limit. Higher pressures will suppress the superconductivity and bring back the Fermi liquid behavior, showing a clear signature of quantum criticality. Our results open a new avenue for investigating the unconventional superconductivity concerning the mysterious 5f-band electrons in this uranium-based system.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization Study on Avalanches in Many-Body Localized Constrained Spin Chains</title>

Abstract: Avalanche is believed to be the mechanism behind the transition from many-body localization to the thermal phase. We utilize spin chains with constraints to study the physics of quantum avalanches by exact diagonalization of disordered systems coupled to a thermal bath. Single-spin observables are used to characterize localization and quantify the influence of the thermal bath on long disordered spin chains. In addition to the PXP model, we construct models by searching for constraints with a genetic algorithm to reach longer system sizes. We define quantities to measure the strength of avalanches and use these to compare different models. Avalanches are more pronounced in models with constraints compared to those without constraints. Exact diagonalization results are compared with other studies using the master equation. We also identify models that exhibit no thermal phases and find stable ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Exponentially Reduced Circuit Depths Using Trotter Error Mitigation</title>

Abstract: Product formulae are a popular class of digital quantum simulation algorithms due to their conceptual simplicity, low overhead, and performance which often exceeds theoretical expectations. Recently, Richardson extrapolation and polynomial interpolation have been proposed to mitigate the Trotter error incurred by use of these formulae. This work provides an improved, rigorous analysis of these techniques for the task of calculating time-evolved expectation values. We demonstrate that, to achieve error $\epsilon$ in a simulation of time $T$ using a $p^\text{th}$-order product formula with extrapolation, circuits depths of $O\left(T^{1+1/p} \textrm{polylog}(1/\epsilon)\right)$ are sufficient -- an exponential improvement in the precision over product formulae alone. Furthermore, we achieve commutator scaling, improve the complexity with $T$, and do not require fractional implementations of Trotter steps. Our results provide a more accurate characterisation of the algorithmic error mitigation techniques currently proposed to reduce Trotter error.</description>

Abstract: Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions in a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Two-particle correlations in mesoscopic colliders have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles grows is hard to address at the microscopic level. Here, we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of up to $N = 5$ electron droplets driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor. We show that the measured multivariate cumulants (of order $k = 2$ to $N$) of the electron droplet are accurately described by $k$-spin correlation functions of an effective Ising model below the N\'eel temperature and can be interpreted as a Coulomb liquid in the thermodynamic limit. Finite size scaling of high-order correlation functions provides otherwise inaccessible fingerprints of emerging order. Our demonstration of emergence in a simple correlated electron collider opens a new way to study engineered states of matter.</description>

Abstract: Whenever the elastic energy of a solid depends on magnetic field, there is a magnetostrictive response. Field-linear magnetostriction implies piezomagnetism and vice versa. Here, we show that Mn$_3$Sn, a non-collinear antiferromanget with Weyl nodes, hosts a large and almost perfectly linear magnetostriction even at room temperature. The longitudinal and transverse magnetostriction, with opposite signs and similar amplitude are restricted to the kagome planes and the out-of-plane response is negligibly small. By studying four different samples with different Mn:Sn ratios, we find a clear correlation between the linear magnetostriction, the spontaneous magnetization and the concentration of Sn vacancies. The recently reported piezomagnetic data fits in our picture. We show that linear magnetostriction and piezomagnetism are both driven by the field-induced in-plane twist of spins. A quantitative account of the experimental data requires the distortion of the spin texture by Sn vacancies. We find that the field-induced domain nucleation within the hysteresis loop corresponds to a phase transition. Within the hysteresis loop, a concomitant mesoscopic modulation of local strain and spin twist angles, leading to twisto-magnetic stripes, arises as a result of the competition between elastic and magnetic energies.</description>

      <title>Composite Structure of Single-Particle Spectral Function in Lightly-Doped Mott Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal structure of doped holes in the Mott insulator may provide important insight into the physics of doped cuprates. Its observability via a single-particle probe by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) and angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES) is explored in this paper. Specifically we study the single-particle spectral function based on a two-hole variational ground state wavefunction [Phys. Rev. X 12, 011062 (2022)] in the $t$-$J$ model. The latter as a strongly correlated state possesses a dichotomy of $d$-wave Cooper pairing and $s$-wave ``twisted'' hole pairing. This pairing structure will give rise to two branches of local spectral function at finite energies. The low-lying one corresponds to a nodal-like quasiparticle excitation and the higher branch is associated with the pair breaking of ``twisted'' quasiparticles, with the threshold energy resembling a pseudogap, which is consistent with the recent STS observation. It can be further extended into energy spectra in momentum space measurable by ARPES, where the low-energy dispersion is also shown to agree well with the Quantum Monte Carlo numerical result for a single hole. It implies that the dominant pairing force arises from the ``twisted'' holes showing up in the high-energy branch. The effect of the next nearest neighbor hopping integral $t'$ is also examined, which shows interesting distinction between $t'/t &gt; 0$ and $t'/t \leq 0$ with a dramatic shift of the low-lying excitation from the nodal region to the antinodal region, but with the high-energy branch remaining insensitive to $t'$. Finally, a possible ``orthogonality catastrophe'' effect, namely, a ``dark matter'' component in the strongly correlated wavefunction that cannot be directly detected by the single-electron spectroscopy, is briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) results for chalcogenide spinels CuCr$_2$X$_4$ with X= S and Se. Both compounds are known as ferromagnetic metals with high Curie temperatures. Our $\mu$SR and magnetization data show clear signatures for additional magnetic transitions far below the respective Curie temperatures. They can be related to changes in the Cr valence system from the mixed valence between Cr$^{3+}$ and Cr$^{4+}$ at high temperatures with collinear ferromagnetism to a charge-ordered state at low temperatures with a different ferromagnetic structure. Our results demonstrate that the electronic systems and the related spin structures of both compounds are more complex than assumed so far.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetism of Kitaev materials has been widely studied, but their charge properties and the coupling to other degrees of freedom are less known. Here we investigate the charge states of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, a promising Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate, in proximity to graphite. We discover that few-layered $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ experiences a clear modulation of charge states, where a Mott-insulator to weak charge-transfer-insulator transition in the 2D limit occurs by means of heterointerfacial polarization. More notably, distinct signals of incommensurate charge and lattice super-modulations, regarded as an unconventional charge order, accompanied in the insulator. Our theoretical calculations have reproduced the incommensurate charge order by taking into account the antiferroelectricity of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ that is driven by dipole order in the internal electric fields. The findings imply that there is strong coupling between the charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom in layered $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the heterostructure, which offers an opportunity to electrically access and tune its magnetic interactions inside the Kitaev compounds.</description>

      <title>Denoising of Imaginary Time Response Functions with Hankel projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary-time response functions of finite-temperature quantum systems are often obtained with methods that exhibit stochastic or systematic errors. Reducing these errors comes at a large computational cost -- in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the reduction of noise by a factor of two incurs a simulation cost of a factor of four. In this paper, we relate certain imaginary-time response functions to an inner product on the space of linear operators on Fock space. We then show that data with noise typically does not respect the positive definiteness of its associated Gramian. The Gramian has the structure of a Hankel matrix. As a method for denoising noisy data, we introduce an alternating projection algorithm that finds the closest positive definite Hankel matrix consistent with noisy data. We test our methodology at the example of fermion Green's functions for continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo data and show remarkable improvements of the error, reducing noise by a factor of up to 20 in practical examples. We argue that Hankel projections should be used whenever finite-temperature imaginary-time data of response functions with errors is analyzed, be it in the context of quantum Monte Carlo, quantum computing, or in approximate semianalytic methodologies.</description>

Abstract: Emergent molecular-like excitations have been discovered in a series of pyrochlore antiferromagnets, yet their origins and relationships with the coexisting magnon excitations remain a puzzle. Here, by incorporating the dynamic spin-lattice coupling through the site-phonon model, we accomplish a unified description of the molecular and magnon excitations, which allows us to provide a statistical interpretation of the molecular-like modes. Our work also demonstrates a semiclassical approach to understand exotic spin dynamics in systems with non-bilinear spin interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor $8/17$, where signatures of incompressibility have been observed in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene. We propose an Abelian state described by the ``$\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$" parton wave function, where a parton itself forms an FQHE state. This state is topologically distinct from the $8/17$ Levin-Halperin state, a daughter state of the Moore-Read state. We carry out extensive numerical exact diagonalization of the Coulomb interaction at 8/17 in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene but find that our results cannot conclusively determine the topological order of the underlying ground state. We work out the low-energy effective theory of the $\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$ edge and make predictions for experimentally measurable properties of the state which can tell it apart from the 8/17 Levin-Halperin state.</description>

Abstract: We present the finite-size scaling theory of one-dimensional quantum critical systems in the presence of boundaries. While the finite-size spectrum in the conformal limit, namely of a conformal field theory with conformally invariant boundary conditions, is related to the dimensions of boundary operators by Cardy, the actual spectra of lattice models are affected by both bulk and boundary perturbations and contain non-universal boundary energies. We obtain a general expression of the finite-size energy levels in the presence of bulk and boundary perturbations. In particular, a generic boundary perturbation related to the energy-momentum tensor gives rise to a renormalization of the effective system size. We verify our field-theory formulation by comparing the results with the exact solution of the critical transverse-field Ising chain and with accurate numerical results on the critical three-state Potts chain obtained by Density-Matrix Renormalization Group.</description>

Abstract: The one-dimensional quantum breakdown model, which features spatially asymmetric fermionic interactions simulating the electrical breakdown phenomenon, exhibits an exponential U(1) symmetry and a variety of dynamical phases including many-body localization and quantum chaos with quantum scar states. We investigate the minimal quantum breakdown model with the minimal number of on-site fermion orbitals required for the interaction, and identify a large number of local conserved charges in the model. We then reveal a mapping between the minimal quantum breakdown model in certain charge sectors and a quantum link model which simulates the U(1) lattice gauge theory, and show that the local conserved charges map to the gauge symmetry generators. A special charge sector of the model further maps to the PXP model, which shows quantum many-body scars. This mapping unveils the rich dynamics in different Krylov subspaces characterized by different gauge configurations in the quantum breakdown model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of Coulomb drag resistance in a bilayer system of strongly correlated electron liquids magnetized by an in-plane field employing the framework of hydrodynamic theory. We identify a mechanism for drag magnetoresistance, which physically arises from the spin diffusion driven by fluctuations of the spin currents within a partially spin-polarized fluid. This effect is further enhanced by acoustic and optic plasmon resonances within the bilayer, where hydrodynamic plasmons are driven by fluctuating viscous stresses. We express the drag magnetoresistivity in terms of the intrinsic dissipative coefficients and basic thermodynamic properties of the electron fluid. Our results are derived nonperturbatively in interaction strength and do not rely on assuming Fermi-liquid behavior of the electron liquid, and applicable also in the regimes of semiquantum and highly correlated classical fluids.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect in the antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal SmAlSi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) has been reported in numerous ferromagnetic (FM) Weyl semimetals. However, AHE in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) or paramagnetic (PM) state of Weyl semimetals has been rarely observed experimentally, and only in centrosymmetric materials. Different mechanisms have been proposed to establish the connection between the AHE and the type of magnetic order. In this paper, we report AHE in both the AFM and PM states of non-centrosymmetric compound SmAlSi. To account for the AHE in non-centrosymmetric Weyl semimetals without FM, we introduce a new mechanism based on magnetic field-induced Weyl nodes evolution. Angle-dependent quantum oscillations in SmAlSi provide evidence for the Weyl points and large AHE in both the PM and the AFM states. The proposed mechanism qualitatively explains the temperature dependence of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC), which displays unconventional power law behavior of the AHC in both AFM and PM states of SmAlSi.</description>

      <title>Corrections to diffusion in interacting quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport and the approach to equilibrium in interacting classical and quantum systems is a challenging problem of both theoretical and experimental interest. One useful organizing principle characterizing equilibration is the dissipative universality class, the most prevalent one being diffusion. In this paper, we use the effective field theory (EFT) of diffusion to systematically obtain universal power-law corrections to diffusion. We then employ large-scale simulations of classical and quantum systems to explore their validity. In particular, we find universal scaling functions for the corrections to the dynamical structure factor $\langle n(x,t)n\rangle$, in the presence of a single $U(1)$ or $SU(2)$ charge in systems with and without particle-hole symmetry, and present the framework to generalize the calculation to multiple charges. Classical simulations show remarkable agreement with EFT predictions for subleading corrections, pushing precision tests of effective theories for thermalizing systems to an unprecedented level. Moving to quantum systems, we perform large-scale tensor-network simulations in unitary and noisy 1d Floquet systems with conserved magnetization. We find a qualitative agreement with EFT which becomes quantitative in the case of noisy systems. Additionally, we show how the knowledge of EFT corrections allows for fitting methods, which can improve the estimation of transport parameters at the intermediate times accessible by simulations and experiments. Finally, we explore non-linear response in quantum systems and find that EFT provides an accurate prediction for its behavior. Our results provide a basis for a better understanding of the non-linear phenomena present in thermalizing systems.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the mean field solution of the quantum and classical Heisenberg spin glasses, using the combination of a high precision numerical solution of the Parisi full replica symmetry breaking equations and a continuous time Quantum Monte Carlo. We characterize the spin glass order and its low-energy excitations down to zero temperature. The Heisenberg spin glass has a rougher energy landscape than its Ising analogue, and exhibits a very slow temperature evolution of its dynamical properties. We extend our analysis to the doped, metallic Heisenberg spin glass, which displays an unexpectedly slow spin dynamics reflecting the proximity to the melting quantum critical point and its associated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Planckian dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the concept of composite topological order in multicomponent systems. In such a state topological order appears only in higher-than-usual composites, with no topological order in elementary fields.

      <title>Non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac Distribution in Persistent Current Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: (i) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; (ii) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhanced Sensitivity through Many-Body Bloch Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensing capacity of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum systems exhibiting Bloch oscillations. By focusing on the resource efficiency of the probe, quantified by quantum Fisher information, we find different scaling behaviors in two different phases, namely localized and extended. Our results provide a quantitative ansatz for quantum Fisher information in terms of time, probe size, and the number of excitations. In the long-time regime, the quantum Fisher information is a quadratic function of time, touching the Heisenberg limit. The system size scaling drastically depends on the phase changing from super-Heisenberg scaling in the extended phase to size-independent behavior in the localized phase. Furthermore, increasing the number of excitations always enhances the precision of the probe, although, in the interacting systems the enhancement becomes less eminent than the non-interacting probes. This is due to the induced localization by increasing the interaction between the excitations.</description>

      <title>A theorem on extensive ground state entropy, spin liquidity and some related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06236v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physics of the paradigmatic one-dimensional transverse field quantum Ising model $J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + h \sum_i \sigma^z_i$ is well-known. Instead, let us imagine ``applying'' the transverse field via a transverse Ising coupling of the spins to partner auxiliary spins, i.e. $H= J_x \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \sigma^x_i \sigma^x_j + J_z \sum_i \sigma^z_i \sigma^z_{\text{partner of }i}$. If each spin of the chain has a unique auxiliary partner, then the resultant eigenspectrum is still the same as that of the quantum Ising model with $\frac{h}{J} = \frac{J_z}{J_x}$ and the degeneracy of the entire spectrum is $2^{\text{number of auxiliary spins}}$. We can interpret this as the auxiliary spins remaining paramagnetic down to zero temperature and an extensive ground state entropy. This follows from the existence of extensively large and mutually \guillemotleft anticommuting\guillemotright $\;$ sets of $local$ conserved quantities for $H$. Such a structure will be shown to be not unnatural in the class of bond-dependent Hamiltonians. In the above quantum Ising model inspired example of $H$, this is lost upon the loss of the unique partner condition for the full spin chain. Other cases where such degeneracy survives or gets lost are also discussed. Thus this is more general and forms the basis for an exact statement on the existence of extensive ground state entropy in any dimension. Furthermore this structure can be used to prove spin liquidity non-perturbatively in the ground state manifold. Higher-dimensional quantum spin liquid constructions based on this are given which are conjectured to evade a quasiparticle description.</description>

      <title>Reference CC3 Excitation Energies for Organic Chromophores: Benchmarking TD-DFT, BSE/$GW$ and Wave Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To expand the QUEST database of highly-accurate vertical transition energies, we consider a series of large organic chromogens ubiquitous in dye chemistry, such as anthraquinone, azobenzene, BODIPY, and naphthalimide. We compute, at the CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies associated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of more than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ these reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function approaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without applying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate a large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals. Additionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) formalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated from various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most accurate models amongst those with respective $\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not outperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include BMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average deviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical excitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both SOS-$\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive performances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH are only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham starting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet transitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis yields the NMEs 4.33(5) for $^{136}$Xe and 5.51(14) for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model the Hartree-exchange-correlation potential of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory adopting a novel strategy inspired by the strictly-correlated-electrons limit and relying on the exact decomposition of the potential based on the exact factorization formalism. Starting with accurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a stretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an approximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham potential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We also test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials corresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange functionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are modified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former and increasing it in the latter.</description>

      <title>Integrals of Products of Bessel Functions: An Insight from the Physics of Bloch Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrals of products of Bessel functions exhibit an intriguing feature: under certain conditions on the parameters specifying the integrand, they vanish identically. We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the context of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a lattice ("Bloch electrons"), namely, in terms of their density of states and umklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of two colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives rise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this context, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that either the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside the band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an umklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being smaller than a critical value.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By theoretically analyzing the recent temperature dependent transport data in pentalayer graphene [Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203], we establish that the experimentally observed transition from low-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect to higher-temperature fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is a crossover phenomenon arising from the competition between interaction and disorder energy scales, with the likely zero temperature ground state of the system being either a localized insulator or a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. In particular, the intriguing suppression of FQAHE in favor of QAHE with decreasing temperature is explained as arising from the low-temperature localization of the carriers where disorder overcomes the interaction effects. We provide a detailed analysis of the data in support of the crossover scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This topical review article reports rapid progress on the generalization and application of entanglement in non-Hermitian free-fermion quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to provide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons contributing from the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs in combination with the magnetic flux, the strong two-particle loss, and the many-body interaction. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>
