      <title>A New Perspective on Determining Disease Invasion and Population Persistence in Heterogeneous Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new quantity known as the network heterogeneity index, denoted by $\mathcal{H}$, which facilitates the investigation of disease propagation and population persistence in heterogeneous environments. Our mathematical analysis reveals that this index embodies the structure of such networks, the disease or population dynamics of patches, and the dispersal between patches. We present multiple representations of the network heterogeneity index and demonstrate that $\mathcal{H}\geq 0$. Moreover, we explore the applications of $\mathcal{H}$ in epidemiology and ecology across various heterogeneous environments, highlighting its effectiveness in determining disease invasibility and population persistence.</description>

      <title>Recovering complex ecological dynamics from time series using state-space universal dynamic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ecological systems often exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics like oscillations, chaos, and regime shifts. Universal dynamic equations have shown promise in modeling complex dynamics by combining known functional forms with neural networks that represent unknown relationships. However, these methods do not yet accommodate the forms of uncertainty common to ecological datasets. To address this limitation, we developed state-space universal dynamic equations by combining universal differential equations with a state-space modeling framework, accounting for uncertainty. We tested this framework on two simulated and two empirical case studies and found that this method can recover nonlinear biological interactions that produce complex behaviors, including chaos and regime shifts. Their forecasting performance is context-dependent, with the best performance being achieved on chaotic and oscillating time series. This new approach leveraging both ecological theory and data-driven machine learning offers a promising new way to make accurate and useful predictions of ecosystem change.</description>

      <title>Using multi-delay discrete delay differential equations to accurately simulate models with distributed delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delayed processes are ubiquitous throughout biology. These delays may arise through maturation processes or as the result of complex multi-step networks, and mathematical models with distributed delays are increasingly used to capture the heterogeneity present in these delayed processes. Typically, these distributed delay differential equations are simulated by discretizing the distributed delay and using existing tools for the resulting multi-delay delay differential equations or by using an equivalent representation under additional assumptions on the delayed process. Here, we use the existing framework of functional continuous Runge-Kutta methods to confirm the convergence of this common approach. Our analysis formalizes the intuition that the least accurate numerical method dominates the error. We give a number of examples to illustrate the predicted convergence, derive a new class of equivalences between distributed delay and discrete delay differential equations, and give conditions for the existence of breaking points in the distributed delay differential equation. Finally, our work shows how recently reported multi-delay complexity collapse arises naturally from the convergence of equations with multiple discrete delays to equations with distributed delays, offering insight into the dynamics of the Mackey-Glass equation.</description>

      <title>Colonization times in Moran process on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moran Birth-death process is a standard stochastic process that is used to model natural selection in spatially structured populations. A newly occurring mutation that invades a population of residents can either fixate on the whole population or it can go extinct due to random drift. The duration of the process depends not only on the total population size $n$, but also on the spatial structure of the population. In this work, we consider the Moran process with a single type of individuals who invade and colonize an otherwise empty environment. Mathematically, this corresponds to the setting where the residents have zero reproduction rate, thus they never reproduce. We present two main contributions. First, in contrast to the Moran process in which residents do reproduce, we show that the colonization time is always at most a polynomial function of the population size $n$. Namely, we show that colonization always takes at most $\frac12n^3-\frac12n^2$ expected steps, and for each $n$, we exactly identify the unique slowest spatial structure where it takes exactly that many steps. Moreover, we establish a stronger bound of roughly $n^{2.5}$ steps for spatial structures that contain only two-way connections and an even stronger bound of roughly $n^2$ steps for lattice-like spatial structures. Second, we discuss various complications that one faces when attempting to measure fixation times and colonization times in spatially structured populations, and we propose to measure the real duration of the process, rather than counting the steps of the classic Moran process.</description>

      <title>Joint identifiability of ancestral sequence, phylogeny and mutation rates under the TKF91 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying jointly the ancestral sequence, the phylogeny and the parameters in models of DNA sequence evolution with insertion and deletion (indel). Under the classical TKF91 model of sequence evolution, we obtained explicit formulas for the root sequence, the pairwise distances of leaf sequences, as well as the scaled rates of indel and substitution in terms of the distribution of the leaf sequences of an arbitrary phylogeny. These explicit formulas not only strengthen existing invertibility results and work for phylogeny that are not necessarily ultrametric, but also lead to new estimators with less assumption compared with the existing literature. Our simulation study demonstrates that these estimators are statistically consistent as the number of independent samples tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Negative density-dependent dispersal of the mountain pine beetle in Alberta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mountain pine beetle's dispersal patterns is critical for evaluating its threat to Canada's boreal forests. It is generally believed that higher beetle densities lead to increased long-distance dispersal due to aggregation pheromones becoming repellent at high densities, causing beetles to seek areas with less competition. However, using helicopter surveys of infested trees, along with statistical models, we find no evidence supporting a positive relationship. Instead, we observe a weak negative association between population density and dispersal at all spatial scales. A possible explanation is that at low population densities, beetles cannot successfully attack healthy trees and must travel farther to find weakened hosts. Even so, the influence of beetle density on dispersal is minor compared to the spatiotemporal variation in the overall (density-independent) scale of dispersal, as revealed by our models. This variation accounts for the MPB's erratic range expansion across western Alberta, which varied from 20 km to 220 km annually.</description>

      <title>Spaces of ranked tree-child networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ranked tree-child networks are a recently introduced class of rooted phylogenetic networks in which the evolutionary events represented by the network are ordered so as to respect the flow of time. This class includes the well-studied ranked phylogenetic trees (also known as ranked genealogies). An important problem in phylogenetic analysis is to define distances between phylogenetic trees and networks in order to systematically compare them. Various distances have been defined on ranked binary phylogenetic trees, but very little is known about comparing ranked tree-child networks. In this paper, we introduce an approach to compare binary ranked tree-child networks on the same leaf set that is based on a new encoding of such networks that is given in terms of a certain partially ordered set. This allows us to define two new spaces of ranked binary tree-child networks. The first space can be considered as a generalization of the recently introduced space of ranked binary phylogenetic trees whose distance is defined in terms of ranked nearest neighbor interchange moves. The second space is a continuous space that captures all equidistant tree-child networks and generalizes the space of ultrametric trees. In particular, we show that this continuous space is a so-called CAT(0)-orthant space which, for example, implies that the distance between two equidistant tree-child networks can be efficiently computed.</description>

      <title>The impact of different degrees of leadership on collective navigation in follower-leader systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In both animal and cell populations, the presence of leaders often underlies the success of collective migration processes, which we characterise by a group maintaining a cohesive configuration that consistently moves toward a target. We extend a recent non-local hyperbolic model for follower-leader systems to investigate different degrees of leadership. Specifically, we consider three levels of leadership: indifferent leaders, who do not alter their movement according to followers; observant leaders, who attempt to remain connected with the followers, but do not allow followers to affect their desired alignment; and persuadable leaders, who integrate their attempt to reach some target with the alignment of all neighbours, both followers and leaders. A combination of analysis and numerical simulations is used to investigate under which conditions each degree of leadership allows successful collective movement to a destination. We find that the indifferent leaders' strategy can result in a cohesive and target-directed migration only for short times. Observant and persuadable leaders instead provide robust guidance, showing that the optimal leader behavior depends on the connection between the migrating individuals: if alignment is low, greater follower influence on leaders is beneficial for successful guidance; otherwise, it can be detrimental and may generate various unsuccessful swarming dynamics.</description>

      <title>Making public reputation out of private assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reputation is not just a simple opinion that an individual has about another but a social construct that emerges through communication. Despite the huge importance in coordinating human behavior, such a communicative aspect has remained relatively unexplored in the field of indirect reciprocity. In this work, we bridge the gap between private assessment and public reputation: We begin by clarifying what we mean by reputation and argue that the formation of reputation can be modeled by a bi-stochastic matrix, provided that both assessment and behavior are regarded as continuous variables. By choosing bi-stochastic matrices that represent averaging processes, we show that only four norms among the leading eight, which judge a good person's cooperation toward a bad one as good, will keep cooperation asymptotically or neutrally stable against assessment error in a homogeneous society where every member has adopted the same norm. However, when one of those four norms is used by the resident population, the opinion averaging process allows neutral invasion of mutant norms with small differences in the assessment rule. Our approach provides a theoretical framework for describing the formation of reputation in mathematical terms.</description>

      <title>A survey of the monotonicity and non-contradiction of consensus methods and supertree methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.04502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent study, Bryant, Francis and Steel investigated the concept of \enquote{future-proofing} consensus methods in phylogenetics. That is, they investigated if such methods can be robust against the introduction of additional data like added trees or new species. In the present manuscript, we analyze consensus methods under a different aspect of introducing new data, namely concerning the discovery of new clades. In evolutionary biology, often formerly unresolved clades get resolved by refined reconstruction methods or new genetic data analyses. In our manuscript we investigate which properties of consensus methods can guarantee that such new insights do not disagree with previously found consensus trees, but merely refine them, a property termed \emph{monotonicity}. Along the lines of analyzing monotonicity, we also study two {established} supertree methods, namely Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP) and Matrix Representation with Compatibility (MRC), which have also been suggested as consensus methods in the literature. While we (just like Bryant, Francis and Steel in their recent study) unfortunately have to conclude some negative answers concerning general consensus methods, we also state some relevant and positive results concerning the majority rule ($\mathtt{MR}$) and strict consensus methods, which are amongst the most frequently used consensus methods. Moreover, we show that there exist infinitely many consensus methods which are monotonic and have some other desirable properties.

      <title>The TAP equation: evaluating combinatorial innovation in Biocosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.14115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate solutions to the TAP equation, a phenomenological implementation of the Theory of the Adjacent Possible. Several implementations of TAP are studied, with potential applications in a range of topics including economics, social sciences, environmental change, evolutionary biological systems, and the nature of physical laws. The generic behaviour is an extended plateau followed by a sharp explosive divergence. We find accurate analytic approximations for the blow-up time that we validate against numerical simulations, and explore the properties of the equation in the vicinity of equilibrium between innovation and extinction. A particular variant, the two-scale TAP model, replaces the initial plateau with a phase of exponential growth, a widening of the TAP equation phenomenology that may enable it to be applied in a wider range of contexts.</description>

      <title>Effects of phylogeny on coexistence in model communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14392v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Species' interactions are shaped by their traits. Thus, we expect traits -- in particular, trait (dis)similarity -- to play a central role in determining whether a particular set of species coexists. Traits are, in turn, the outcome of an eco-evolutionary process summarized by a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree associated with a set of species should carry information about the dynamics and assembly properties of the community. Many studies have highlighted the potentially complex ways in which this phylogenetic information is translated into species' ecological properties. However, much less emphasis has been placed on developing clear, quantitative expectations for community properties under a particular hypothesis. To address this gap, we couple a simple model of trait evolution on a phylogenetic tree with Lotka-Volterra community dynamics. This allows us to derive properties of a community of coexisting species as a function of the number of traits, tree topology and the size of the species pool. Our analysis highlights how phylogenies, through traits, affect the coexistence of a set of species. Together, these results provide much-needed baseline expectations for the ways in which evolutionary history, summarized by phylogeny, is reflected in the size and structure of ecological communities.</description>

      <title>Tree balance in phylogenetic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree shape statistics, particularly measures of tree (im)balance, play an important role in the analysis of the shape of phylogenetic trees. With applications ranging from testing evolutionary models to studying the impact of fertility inheritance and selection, or tumor development and language evolution, the assessment of measures of tree balance is important. Currently, a multitude of at least 30 (im)balance indices can be found in the literature, alongside numerous other tree shape statistics.
  This diversity prompts essential questions: How can we assist researchers in choosing only a small number of indices to mitigate the challenges of multiple testing? Is there a preeminent balance index tailored to specific tasks?
  This research expands previous studies on the examination of index power, encompassing almost all established indices and a broader array of alternative models, such as a variety of trait-based models. Our investigation reveals distinct groups of balance indices better suited for different tree models, suggesting that decisions on balance index selection can be enhanced with prior knowledge. Furthermore, we present the \textsf{R} software package \textsf{poweRbal} which allows the inclusion of new indices and models, thus facilitating future research on the power of tree shape statistics.</description>

      <title>Determinism vs. stochasticity in competitive flour beetle communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As ecologists increasingly adopt stochastic models over deterministic ones, the question arises: when is this a positive development and when is this an unnecessary complication? While deterministic models -- like the Lotka-Volterra model -- provide straightforward predictions about competitive outcomes, they are often unrealistic. Stochastic models are more realistic, but their complexity can limit their usefulness in explaining coexistence. Here, we investigate the relative importance of deterministic and stochastic processes in competition between two flour beetle species, Tribolium castaneum and Tribolium confusum. Specifically, we use highly-replicated one-generation experiments (784 microcosms) to parameterize a mechanistic model. Both the full stochastic model and the underlying deterministic skeleton exhibit priority effects, where one species excludes the other, but the identity of the winning species depends on initial abundances. Stochasticity makes the identity of the winner less predictable, but deterministic dynamics still make reliable predictions (94% accuracy across a range of reasonable initial abundances). We conclude that deterministic population dynamics are sufficient to account for patterns of coexistence (or lack thereof), a potentially general finding that is supported by recent field studies. Additionally, we resolve longstanding issues in flour beetle research by identifying selective egg predation as the mechanism for priority effects, demonstrating the primacy of demographic stochasticity (compared to environmental stochasticity), and reinterpreting classic competition experiments to show that apparent coexistence often represents long-term transient dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stratified dispersal explains mountain pine beetle's range expansion in Alberta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mountain pine beetle (MPB), a destructive pest native to Western North America, has recently extended its range into Alberta, Canada. Predicting the dispersal of MPB is challenging due to their small size and complex dispersal behavior. Because of these challenges, estimates of MPB's typical dispersal distances have varied widely, ranging from 10 meters to 18 kilometers. Here, we use high-quality data from helicopter and field-crew surveys to parameterize a large number of dispersal kernels. We find that fat-tailed kernels -- those which allow for a small number of long-distance dispersal events -- consistently provide the best fit to the data. Specifically, the radially-symmetric Student's t-distribution with parameters {\nu} = 0.012 and {\rho} = 1.45 stands out as parsimonious and user-friendly; this model predicts a median dispersal distance of 60 meters, but with the 95th percentile of dispersers travelling nearly 5 kilometers. The best-fitting mathematical models have biological interpretations. The Student's t-distribution, derivable as a mixture of diffusive processes with varying settling times, is consistent with observations that most beetles fly short distances while few travel far; early-emerging beetles fly farther; and larger beetles from larger trees exhibit greater variance in flight distance. Finally, we explain why other studies have found such a wide variation in the length scale in MPB dispersal, and we demonstrate that long-distance dispersal events are critical for modelling MPB range expansion.</description>
