      <title>Evolutionary Automata and Deep Evolutionary Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolution by natural selection, which is one of the most compelling themes of modern science, brought forth evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation, applying mechanisms of evolution in nature to various problems solved by computers. In this paper we concentrate on evolutionary automata that constitute an analogous model of evolutionary computation compared to well-known evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary automata provide a more complete dual model of evolutionary computation, similar like abstract automata (e.g., Turing machines) form a more formal and precise model compared to recursive algorithms and their subset - evolutionary algorithms. An evolutionary automaton is an automaton that evolves performing evolutionary computation perhaps using an infinite number of generations. This model allows for a direct modeling evolution of evolution, and leads to tremendous expressiveness of evolutionary automata and evolutionary computation. This also gives the hint to the power of natural evolution that is self-evolving by interactive feedback with the environment.</description>

      <title>Learnable Activation Functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of learnable activation functions in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Specifically, we compare the efficacy of traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with fixed and learnable activations against Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which employ learnable basis functions. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as an effective method for directly incorporating physical laws into the learning process, offering a data-efficient solution for both the forward and inverse problems associated with PDEs. However, challenges such as effective training and spectral bias, where low-frequency components are learned more effectively, often limit their applicability to problems characterized by rapid oscillations or sharp transitions. By employing different activation or basis functions on MLP and KAN, we assess their impact on convergence behavior and spectral bias mitigation, and the accurate approximation of PDEs. The findings offer insights into the design of neural network architectures that balance training efficiency, convergence speed, and test accuracy for PDE solvers. By evaluating the influence of activation or basis function choices, this work provides guidelines for developing more robust and accurate PINN models. The source code and pre-trained models used in this study are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and future exploration.</description>

      <title>Activation Functions for "A Feedforward Unitary Equivariant Neural Network"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Ma and Chan (2023)], we presented a feedforward unitary equivariant neural network. We proposed three distinct activation functions tailored for this network: a softsign function with a small residue, an identity function, and a Leaky ReLU function. While these functions demonstrated the desired equivariance properties, they limited the neural network's architecture. This short paper generalises these activation functions to a single functional form. This functional form represents a broad class of functions, maintains unitary equivariance, and offers greater flexibility for the design of equivariant neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Neural Network Training Method Based on Distributed PID Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous article, we introduced a neural network framework based on symmetric differential equations. This novel framework exhibits complete symmetry, endowing it with perfect mathematical properties. While we have examined some of the system's mathematical characteristics, a detailed discussion of the network training methodology has not yet been presented. Drawing on the principles of the traditional backpropagation algorithm, this study proposes an alternative training approach that utilizes differential equation signal propagation instead of chain rule derivation. This approach not only preserves the effectiveness of training but also offers enhanced biological interpretability. The foundation of this methodology lies in the system's reversibility, which stems from its inherent symmetry,a key aspect of our research. However, this method alone is insufficient for effective neural network training. To address this, we further introduce a distributed Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control approach, emphasizing its implementation within a closed system. By incorporating this method, we achieved both faster training speeds and improved accuracy. This approach not only offers novel insights into neural network training but also extends the scope of research into control methodologies. To validate its effectiveness, we apply this method to the MNIST dataset, demonstrating its practical utility.</description>

      <title>STREAM: A Universal State-Space Model for Sparse Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision. Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.</description>

      <title>Deriving Activation Functions via Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activation functions play a crucial role in introducing non-linearities to deep neural networks. We propose a novel approach to designing activation functions by focusing on their gradients and deriving the corresponding functions through integration. Our work introduces the Expanded Integral of the Exponential Linear Unit (xIELU), a trainable piecewise activation function derived by integrating trainable affine transformations applied on the ELU activation function. xIELU combines two key gradient properties: a trainable and linearly increasing gradient for positive inputs, similar to ReLU$^2$, and a trainable negative gradient flow for negative inputs, akin to xSiLU. Conceptually, xIELU can be viewed as extending ReLU$^2$ to effectively handle negative inputs. In experiments with 1.1B parameter Llama models trained on 126B tokens of FineWeb Edu, xIELU achieves lower perplexity compared to both ReLU$^2$ and SwiGLU when matched for the same compute cost and parameter count.</description>

      <title>Efficient Brain Imaging Analysis for Alzheimer's and Dementia Detection Using Convolution-Derivative Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and results in detrimental structural changes in human brains. Detecting these changes is crucial for early diagnosis and timely intervention of disease progression. Jacobian maps, derived from spatial normalization in voxel-based morphometry (VBM), have been instrumental in interpreting volume alterations associated with AD. However, the computational cost of generating Jacobian maps limits its clinical adoption. In this study, we explore alternative methods and propose Sobel kernel angle difference (SKAD) as a computationally efficient alternative. SKAD is a derivative operation that offers an optimized approach to quantifying volumetric alterations through localized analysis of the gradients. By efficiently extracting gradient amplitude changes at critical spatial regions, this derivative operation captures regional volume variations Evaluation of SKAD over various medical datasets demonstrates that it is 6.3x faster than Jacobian maps while still maintaining comparable accuracy. This makes it an efficient and competitive approach in neuroimaging research and clinical practice.</description>
