      <title>Coupled concentration-charge dynamics in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, local transient response and fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupled dynamics of concentration and charge in asymmetric 1:1 electrolytes, focusing on the interplay between diffusion asymmetry and external electric fields. Using Brownian dynamics simulations and linearized stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), we analyze the transient response of charge and number currents to inhomogeneous electric fields, as well as the steady-state spatio-temporal fluctuations under uniform fields. Our results reveal that asymmetry in ionic diffusion coefficients introduces a non-trivial coupling between charge and number transport, which modifies the two relaxation modes already present in symmetric electrolytes -- a fast one associated with charge relaxation and a slow one linked to ambipolar diffusion. The dynamics are further modulated by the applied field, which enhances diffusion, alters screening lengths, and induces oscillatory behavior in the relaxation modes. The SDFT framework provides closed-form expressions for the intermediate scattering matrix, capturing the dynamics of density fluctuations and cross-correlations between number and charge. These predictions are validated by simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement across a wide range of wave vectors, both at equilibrium and under a finite electric field. Our findings highlight the critical role of diffusion asymmetry and external fields in tuning the transport properties of electrolytes, with implications for nanofluidic devices, energy harvesting, and iontronic circuits. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical applications, offering a robust framework for understanding and controlling electrolyte dynamics in asymmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining active tension nets with discrete conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to inert materials, living cells use molecular motors to generate forces independently of elastic strain. How do local active forces translate into large-scale shape, and what are the mechanical properties of the resulting "living matter"? Here, we address these questions within the active tension network (ATN) model for the mechanics of 2d epithelia. We represent the configuration of active forces geometrically by a tension triangulation dual to the cell tessellation. The Voronoi dual of the tension triangulation is shown to be macroscopically stress-free -- the tensions hence define an emergent reference state for the tissue. Two soft modes, curl-free and conformal deformations, map this reference to the internally stressed, but force-balanced, physical configuration of the tissue. Conformal deformations parametrize pressure gradients, leading to a generalization of von Neumann's law for the pressure in a foam. Via finite-element-like interpolation and a notion of "discrete" conformal maps, we both construct the mechanically balanced cell tessellations exactly on the microscopic level, and pass to the continuum limit. We systematically incorporate cell rearrangement into our theory by representing cell-scale topology in terms of circle packings. The results of this bottom-up coarse-graining study match a top-down continuum analysis presented in a companion paper. Thus, the geometry of force balance bridges between micro- and macro-scales, elucidating how cell-level active forces program shape. The present formalism may be useful in the study of foams, granular matter, and metamaterials, as well as in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fracture initiation in silicate glasses via a universal shear localization mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear bands lie at the root of fracture initiation in bulk metallic glasses and amorphous polymers. For silicate glasses, in contrast, studies have largely emphasized permanent volumetric strain, commonly referred to as densification. Here we systematically investigate indentation-induced fracture in two distinct families of aluminoborosilicate glasses. The results demonstrate that plastic shear flow plays a decisive role in governing fracture initiation. In addition, molecular dynamics simulations reveal a pronounced composition dependence of softening associated with plastic shear flow, closely mirroring the experimentally observed propensity for strain localization. We conclude that silicate glasses conform to a universal pattern of rupture initiation governed by localization of shear-deformation, aligning with a broad range of amorphous materials, including bulk metallic glasses and glassy polymers.</description>

      <title>Diffusive buckling fronts in lattice-based metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials can be designed to exhibit unique mechanical properties, including tunable auxetic behavior as well as multi-stability, which arise from the geometry and configuration of the constituent building blocks. Lattice-based metamaterials, in particular, provide lightweight platforms where local instabilities can dictate the global response, with applications in energy routing, vibration isolation, and impact mitigation. In underdamped structures, perturbations have been found to propagate as nonlinear waves, e.g., transition waves or solitons. Here we investigate the opposite limit of overdamped, highly dissipative lattice metamaterials. Focusing on three-dimensional structures, we uncover how buckling instabilities, triggered by compression, propagate as fronts that shape the macroscopic behavior. We demonstrate in experiments on 3D-printed simple cubic lattices how global and local buckling modes can be controlled via the lattice geometry. By incorporating viscoelastic dissipation into a 3D-continuum model, we show that strain-driven buckling fronts obey coupled reaction-diffusion equations. The diffusion and reaction coefficients, determined by local geometry, material properties, and strain, select the propagation direction and enable steering of the fronts. This establishes a predictive and experimentally validated framework for the control of cascading mechanical instabilities in lattice-based metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Designing DNA nanostar hydrogels with programmable degradation and antibody release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA nanostar (DNAns) hydrogels are promising materials for in vivo applications, including tissue regeneration and drug and antibody delivery. However, a systematic and quantitative understanding of the design principles controlling their degradation is lacking. Here, we investigate hydrogels made of three-armed DNAns with varying flexible joints, arm lengths, and mesh sizes and use restriction enzymes to cut the DNAns structures while monitoring the gel's degradation. We discover that (i) removing flexible joints, (ii) increasing arm length, or (iii) relocating the RE site along a DNA linker markedly accelerates hydrogel degradation. In contrast, non-specific endonucleases, e.g. DNaseI, quicly degrade DNAns hydrogels regardless of design. Importantly, the release of antibodies from DNAns hydrogels can be modulated by the action of different enzymes, confirming that programmable degradation can be leveraged for responsive drug-delivery systems. These findings provide a better understanding of the design principles for DNAns-based scaffolds with tunable degradation, cargo release, and responsive rheology.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient time series processing in real-time with fluidic iontronic memristor circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iontronic neuromorphic computing has emerged as a rapidly expanding paradigm. The arrival of angstrom-confined iontronic devices enables ultra-low power consumption with dynamics and memory timescales that intrinsically align well with signals of natural origin, a challenging combination for conventional (solid-state) neuromorphic materials. However, comparisons to earlier conventional substrates and evaluations of concrete application domains remain a challenge for iontronics. Here we propose a pathway toward iontronic circuits that can address established time series benchmark tasks, enabling performance comparisons and highlighting possible application domains for efficient real-time time series processing. We model a Kirchhoff-governed circuit with iontronic memristors as edges, while the dynamic internal voltages serve as output vector for a linear readout function, during which energy consumption is also logged. All these aspects are integrated into the open-source pyontronics package. Without requiring input encoding or virtual timing mechanisms, our simulations demonstrate prediction performance comparable to various earlier solid-state reservoirs, notably with an exceptionally low energy consumption of over 5 orders of magnitude lower. These results suggest a pathway of iontronic technologies for ultra-low-power real-time neuromorphic computation.</description>

      <title>Self-organized flows break morphological symmetry in active/passive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a phase-separating mixture of active and passive fluids and explore morphological asymmetries of the emerging dominantly bicontinous dynamic emulsion. Two-dimensional numerical simulations reveal that the geometric and topological asymmetries can solely be explained by self-organized flows in the active region. As in inertial turbulence an inverse energy cascade in the active region leads to the formation of condensates. The size of these mesocales vortices is determined by the locally available space in the emulsion. As these condensates accumulate energy they impact the fluctuation of the surrounding interface and thus form a tight coupling between the flow field and the dynamic morphology. While explored for active/passive systems the symmetry-breaking mechanism can be generalized to heterogeneous active systems and proposes a way to control the morphology of various functional soft materials.</description>

      <title>Coupled gas and bubble dynamics at the solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and entrapment of gas bubbles during solidification significantly influence the microstructure and mechanical properties of materials, from metallic alloys to ice. While gas segregation at the solidification front is well-documented, the real-time dynamics of bubble nucleation, growth, and engulfment-and their dependence on solidification velocity-remain poorly understood. In this study, we use in situ cryo-confocal fluorescence microscopy to investigate the coupled gas-bubble dynamics at the solidification front of carbonated water, systematically varying the solidification velocity ($V = 1-20 \mu m/s$) while maintaining a constant thermal gradient ($G = 15 K/mm$). Our experiments reveal that bubble nucleation is governed by a characteristic nucleation time, which emerges from the interplay between gas diffusion ahead of the front, nucleation kinetics, and bubble growth, all competing with the advancing solidification front. These results allow us to estimate the critical gas concentration for bubbles nucleation in carbonated water. These results offer a detailed understanding of the mechanisms controlling bubble nucleation and entrapment during solidification at constant thermal gradient. They contribute to the development of strategies to control bubble formation in industrial processes where the presence of bubbles can either be detrimental or intentionally harnessed.</description>

      <title>Theoretical relationship between the macro-texture and micro-structure in dairy processing revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical relationship between the macroscopic textural quality and microscopic structural quality appearing in the phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter is revealed by the multi-scale simulation of coupled map lattice (CML) based on the mesoscopic elementary processes of the emulsion interfaces. Using the Young-Laplace equation, we derive the microscopic particle quantities of the size and density of air bubbles and butter grains in an emulsion from the macroscopic rheological quantities of the overrun and viscosity of the emulsion. In doing so, we focus on the size determined by the "tug-of-war" between air bubbles and butter grains via their cohesion pressures, and on the density determined by the "costume change" of the emulsion molecular complexes (clad particles, e.g., butter grain-clad air bubbles) to their suitable size. Using the obtained microscopic particle quantities, we now propose a microscopic state diagram, the size-density plane, in addition to the previously proposed macroscopic state diagram, the viscosity-overrun plane. These state diagrams reveal that while the two well-known different phase inversion processes at high and low whipping temperatures appear as the two parallel processes of viscosity dominance and overrun dominance in the viscosity-overrun plane, they appear as the two orthogonal processes of isodensity/size dominance and isosize/density dominance in the size-density plane. This theoretical simulation result is significant for the quality design of butter because it demonstrates that differences in macroscopic textural quality can be easily controlled by differences in microscopic structural quality.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reconstruction of Moving Contact Loads on an Elastic Half-Space Using Prescribed Surface Displacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the elastic response of a two-dimensional semi-infinite medium subjected to a moving surface load with a prescribed displacement profile. As a fundamental step, we derive analytical Green's functions for the displacement and stress fields generated by a point load traveling at a constant velocity along the surface, explicitly incorporating elastodynamic effects through Mach number dependence. These moving-load solutions serve as building blocks for constructing more general loading scenarios via linear superposition. Based on Green's functions, an inverse problem is formulated to reconstruct the unknown surface traction responsible for a given surface displacement. The inverse analysis is performed through a Fourier-domain inversion with regularization, which enables a direct and computationally efficient determination of the contact pressure without iterative forward simulations. This framework is applied to a rigid wheel-ground contact problem, where the imposed displacement is dictated by the wheel geometry. The reconstructed surface traction exhibits a smooth, symmetric distribution within the contact region, while the resulting subsurface stress fields are obtained in closed analytical form and involve dilogarithm functions. The principal stress difference reveals characteristic spatial patterns similar to photoelastic fringes, and their asymmetry increases with the Mach number, reflecting the dynamic nature of the moving contact.</description>

      <title>On the testing of grain shape corrections to bedload transport equations with grain-resolved numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using grain-resolved LES-DEM simulations, Zhang et al. (J. Geophys. Res. Earth Surf. 130, e2024JF007937, 2025) aimed to validate a grain-shape-corrected bedload transport equation proposed earlier by the same group. It states that grain shape effects are captured through a modified Shields number that depends, among others, on the drag coefficient, $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$, determined from the force balance for a grain settling in a fluid at rest. To independently vary $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ in their simulations, the authors changed the boundary conditions on the grains' surfaces: By artificially shifting the locations of the no-slip conditions from the actual grain surface to a virtual surface a distance $l$ into the grain interior, they hoped to well approximate Navier-slip conditions with a slip length $l$. Here, we argue that this approximation is appropriate only if the thickness of the boundary layer that forms around the virtual surface is much larger than $l$, which we demonstrate was not the case for the authors' simulations. In particular, using independent DNS-DEM grain settling simulations for the same hydrodynamic conditions, we directly show that this approximation substantially overestimates the value of $C_{D_\mathrm{settle}}$ of a Navier-slip sphere. This implies that the conditions created with their artificial method do not correspond to physically realistic scenarios and therefore do not support the authors' grain shape correction. To support this conclusion, we demonstrate that their entire numerical data can be alternatively explained by a simple null hypothesis model, without grain shape correction, based on the virtual-grain rather than the actual-grain size.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description>

      <title>Bubble growth in a confined heated polymer: the example of safety glass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laminated safety glass (LSG) is a composite assembly of glass and polyvinyl butyral (PVB), a viscoelastic polymer. LSG can be found in building facades, important landmarks around the world, and every major form of transportation. Yet, the assembly suffers from unwanted bubbles which are anathema to one of the most important features of glass: optical transparency. In here, we present an in-depth study of the reasons behind these bubbles, either during high-temperature quality control tests or normal glass operating conditions. We provide a physical model for bubble growth that deals with two gases, thermal effects on gas solubility and diffusivity, and a time-temperature dependent rheology. The model can be extended to n-component bubbles or other materials beyond PVB. By combining experiments and theory, we show that two gases are at play: air trapped in interfacial bubbles in the assembly during lamination and water initially dissolved in the polymer bulk. Both gases work in tandem to induce bubble growth in finished assemblies of LSG provided that (i) the original bubble nucleus has a critical size and (ii) the polymer relaxes (softens) sufficiently enough, especially at elevated temperatures. The latter constraints are relaxed in a condition we termed anomalous air oversaturation that may even trigger a catastrophic, yet beautiful ice flower instability.</description>

Abstract: We study fractal properties of systems of densely and randomly packed disks, obeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various protocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) and constant pressure (CP) protocols, and the generalized Apollonian packing. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure factor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the distribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. We show that the size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the consistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the less the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement between the exponents. For the DT protocol, all three exponents coincide even at moderate values of the size ratio. For the CP protocol, the exponents are different for both moderate and large size ratios. The suppression of the exponent of the structure factor in the CP packing is explained by the specific behaviour of pores, which contain relatively big cavities. We develop an algorithm for calculating the pore size distribution and show that it is related to the exponent of the structure factor. We argue that the presence of the cavities lowers the configuration entropy and thus reduces the randomness of the CP packing. Thus the cavities reduce both packing fraction and randomness of the CP packings. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting that all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems</title>

Abstract: We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Homogenization framework for rigid and non-rigid foldable origami metamaterials</title>

Abstract: Origami metamaterials typically consist of folded sheets with periodic patterns, conferring them with remarkable mechanical properties. In the context of Continuum Mechanics, the majority of existing predictive methods are mechanism analogs which favor rigid folding and panel bending. While effective in predicting primary deformation modes, existing methods fall short in capturing the full spectrum of deformation of non-rigid foldable origami, such as the emergence of curvature along straight creases, local strain at vertices and warpage in panels. To fully capture the entire deformation spectrum and enhance the accuracy of existing methods, this paper introduces a homogenization framework for origami metamaterials where the faces are modeled as plate elements. Both asymptotic and energy-based homogenization methods are formulated and implemented. As a representative crease pattern, we examine the Miura origami sheet homogenized as an equivalent Kirchhoff-Love plate. The results reveal that certain effective elastic properties are nonlinearly related to both the initial fold angle and the crease stiffness. When benchmarked with results from fully resolved simulations, our framework yields errors up to 12.9\%, while existing models, including the bar-and-hinge model and the rigid-panel model, show up to 161\% error. The differences in errors are associated with the complex modes of crease and panel deformation in non-rigid origami, unexplored by the existing models. This work demonstrates a precise and efficient continuum framework for origami metamaterials as an effective strategy for predicting their elastic properties, understanding their mechanics, and designing their functionalities.</description>

Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Particles in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the Brinkman-regularized Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase system, we construct the near- and far-field dipolar velocity and associated stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a position-based Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of N dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. We demonstrate this Hamiltonian structure by simulating ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the near-field and far-field Hamiltonians. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations. Our work thus provides a concrete realization of position-based Hamiltonian descriptions for active particles in incompressible fluid membranes and establishes the important roles of membrane incompressibility and fluid vorticity that leads to the emergence of such Hamiltonian descriptions.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. As such, these intermediate metastable states dominate the system's dynamics at coarse grained times. Moreover, they can strongly influence the overall pathways through which the energy landscape is explored. Thus, quantifying these metastabilities is crucial for uncovering the key details of the underlying landscape. Here, we introduce a robust method based on a generalized many-body Arrhenius law to identify metastable states in escape problems involving interacting particles with excluded volume. Experimental platforms such as colloidal transport or macromolecular translocation through biological pores can offer promising settings to validate our predictions.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior based on agent-environment interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.</description>
