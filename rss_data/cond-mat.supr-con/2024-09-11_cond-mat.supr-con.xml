      <title>Pressure-induced superconductivity in monoclinic RhBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RhBi$_2$ is a polymorphic system that exhibits two distinct phases. RhBi$_2$ in the triclinic phase has been identified as a weak topological insulator with a van Hove singularity point close to the Fermi energy. Thus, triclinic RhBi$_2$ is expected to exhibit exotic quantum properties under strain or pressure. In this study, we report on the emergence of superconductivity in the monoclinic RhBi$_2$ under external pressures. The electrical resistivity behavior of the monoclinic RhBi$_2$ single crystal is studied at a wide range of applied external pressures up to 40 GPa. We observe a pressure-induced superconductivity with a dome-shaped dependence of the critical temperature on pressure at pressures above 10 GPa. A maximum critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) value of $T_\mathrm{c}$ = 5.1 K is reached at the pressure of 16.1 GPa. Furthermore, we performed detailed ab initio calculations to understand the electronic band structures of monoclinic RhBi$_2$ under varying pressures. The combination of topology and pressure-induced superconductivity in the RhBi$_2$ polymorphic system may provide us with a new promising material platform to investigate topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene, which has been discovered experimentally in Han $et$ $al$ arXiv:2408.15233. We construct a minimal model for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity, assuming a simplified anisotropic interaction that depends only on the angle between the incoming and outgoing momenta. Despite the absence of Fermi surface nesting, we show that the superconductivity appears near the Van Hove singularity with the maximal $T_c$ near a bifurcation point of the peaks in the density of states. We identify the topological $p+ip$, topological $h+ih$, and the non-topological nodal $f$-wave pairings as the possible states, which are all pair density wave orders due to the intravalley nature. Furthermore, these pair density wave orders require a finite attractive threshold for superconductivity, resulting in narrow superconducting regions, consistent with experimental findings. We discuss the possible pairing mechanisms and point out that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism is a plausible explanation for the intravalley spin-polarized superconductivity in the rhombohedral tetralayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Synthetic fractional flux quanta in a ring of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A ring of capacitively-coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as `Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubits sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read-out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis and chaos in anomalous Josephson junctions without capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Usually, overdamped Josephson junctions do not exhibit chaotic behavior in their phase dynamics, either because the phase space dimension is less than three (as in the case of a single overdamped ac-driven junction) or due to the general tendency of systems to become less chaotic with increasing dissipation (as in the case of coupled overdamped junctions). Here we consider the so-called $\varphi_0$ superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junction in which the current flowing through the junction may induce magnetization dynamics in the ferromagnetic interlayer. We find that due to the induced magnetization dynamics, even in the overdamped limit, i.e. for a junction without capacitance, the junction may exhibit chaos and hysteresis that in some cases leads to multiple branches in its current-voltage characteristics. We also show that pulsed current signals can be used to switch between the different voltage states, even in the presence of added thermal noise. Such switching could be used in cryogenic memory components.</description>

      <title>Majorana multipole response with magnetic point group symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions (MFs) in a topological superconductor exhibit anisotropic electromagnetic responses, called Majorana multipole responses, when MFs are degenerate under time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. In time-reversal symmetric systems, the Majorana multipole response relates to Cooper pair symmetry in the underlying superconducting material, which provides a way to identify pairing symmetries through surface-spin-sensitive measurements. Here, we extend the concept of Majorana multipole response to systems with magnetic point group symmetry that break time-reversal symmetry and clarify how the response of MFs includes information about underlying superconductors. From a topological classification of symmetry-protected MFs and an effective surface theory, we classify possible magnetic and electric responses for MFs, which manifests a direct connection to Cooper pair symmetry for a symmetry-enforced pair of MFs. Additionally, we find several time-reversal-even higher-order multipole responses, such as the quadrupole response, which are forbidden in time-reversal symmetric systems, whereby indicating breaking of time-reversal symmetry. The theory is applied to the odd-parity chiral superconductor UTe$_2$ and the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe, demonstrating the appearance of a magnetic quadrupole response on a surface.</description>

      <title>Coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>

      <title>Spin-resolved nonlocal transport in proximitized Rashba nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium transport in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor nanowires is crucial for many quantum phenomena such as generating entangled states via cross Andreev reflection (CAR) processes, detecting topological superconductivity, reading out Andreev spin qubits, coupling spin qubits over long distances and so on. Here, we investigate numerically transport properties of a proximitized Rashba nanowire that hosts spin-polarized low-energy quasiparticle states. We show that the spin polarization in such one-dimensional Andreev bands, extended over the entire nanowire length, can be detected in nonlocal transport measurements with tunnel-coupled side leads that are spin polarized. Remarkably, we find an exact correspondence between the sign of the nonlocal conductance and the spin density of the superconducting quasiparticles at the side lead position. We demonstrate that this feature is robust to moderate static disorder. As an example, we show that such a method can be used to detect spin inversion of the bands, accompanying the topological phase transition (TPT) for realistic system parameters. Furthermore, we show that such effects can be used to switch between CAR and elastic cotunneling (ECT) processes by tuning the strength of either the electric or the magnetic field. These findings hold significant practical implications for state-of-the-art transport experiments in such hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of order-fractionalization in the CPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the half-filled CPT model, an analytically tractable Kondo lattice model with Yao-Lee spin-spin interactions on a 3D hyperoctagon lattice, proposed by Coleman, Panigrahi, and Tsvelik. Previous studies have established that the CPT model exhibits odd-frequency triplet superconductivity and order fractionalization. Through asymptotic analyses in the small $J$ and large $J$ Kondo coupling limits, we identify a quantum critical point at $J_c$, marking a transition from a superconductor to a Kondo insulator. By estimating the vison gap energy to account for thermal gauge fluctuations, we determine the energy scales governing the thermal breakdown of order fractionalization. Moreover, at large $J$ the Kondo insulator undergoes orbital decoupling, leading to the formation of a decoupled Kitaev orbital liquid. These findings and analogies with the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauged $XY$ model lead us to propose a tentative phase diagram for the CPT model at half-filling.</description>

      <title>Finite-size topological phases from semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological semimetals are some of the topological phases of matter most intensely-studied experimentally. The Weyl semimetal phase, in particular, has garned tremendous, sustained interest given fascinating signatures such as the Fermi arc surface states and the chiral anomaly, as well as the minimal requirements to protect this three-dimensional topological phase. Here, we show that thin films of Weyl semimetals (which we call quasi-(3-1)-dimensional, or q(3-1)d) generically realize finite-size topological phases distinct from 3d and 2d topological phases of established classification schemes: response signatures of the 3d bulk topology co-exist with topologically-protected, quasi-(3-2)d Fermi arc states or chiral boundary modes due to a second, previously-unidentified bulk-boundary correspondence. We show these finite-size topological semimetal phases are realized by Hamiltonians capturing the Fermiology of few-layer Van der Waals material MoTe2 in experiment. Given the broad experimental interest in few-layer Van der Waals materials and topological semimetals, our work paves the way for extensive future theoretical and experimental characterization of finite-size topological phases.</description>
