      <title>An introduction to local differential privacy protocols using block designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of protocols for local differential privacy (or LDP) has been a topic of considerable research interest in recent years. LDP protocols utilise the randomised encoding of outcomes of an experiment using a transition probability matrix (TPM). Several authors have observed that balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs) provide nice examples of TPMs for LDP protocols. Indeed, it has been shown that such BIBD-based LDP protocols provide optimal estimators.
  In this primarily expository paper, we give a detailed introduction to LDP protocols and their connections with block designs. We prove that a subclass of LDP protocols known as pure LDP protocols are equivalent to $(r,\lambda)$-designs (which contain balanced incomplete block designs as a special case). An unbiased estimator for an LDP scheme is a left inverse of the transition probability matrix. We show that the optimal estimators for BIBD-based TPMs are precisely those obtained from the Moore-Penrose inverse of the corresponding TPM. We also review some existing work on optimal LDP protocols in the context of pure protocols.</description>

      <title>Frugal coloring of graphs revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $t$, an independent set $S\subseteq V(G)$ is $t$-frugal if every vertex has at most $t$ neighbors in $S$. A $t$-frugal coloring of $G$ is a partition of its vertex set into $t$-frugal independent sets. The maximum cardinality of a $t$-frugal independent set in $G$ is denoted by $\alpha_t^f(G)$, while the minimum cardinality of a $t$-frugal coloring of $G$, $\chi_t^f(G)$, is called the $t$-frugal chromatic number of $G$. Frugal colorings were introduced in 1998 and studied later in just a handful of papers. In this paper, we revisit this concept. While the NP-hardness of frugal coloring is known, we prove that the decision version of $\alpha_t^f$ is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs, and present a linear-time algorithm to determine its value for trees. We prove a general sharp lower bound on $\chi_{t}^{f}(G)$ expressed in terms of $\alpha_{t}^{f}(G)$ and size of $G$. We also give a sharp upper bound on the $\alpha_2^f$ of any graph $G$, which in the case of graphs with minimum degree $\delta\geq2$ simplifies to $\alpha_2^f(G)\le 2n/(\delta+2)$. We prove that $3\le\chi_2^f(G)\le 5$ holds for any graph $G$ with $\Delta(G)=3$. For several classes of graphs such as block graphs, the Cartesian and strong products of multiple two-way infinite paths, we determine the exact values of $\alpha_2^f$. We provide sharp bounds on the $\alpha_2^f$ in all four standard graph products, which are expressed as different invariants of their factors. Finally, we obtain Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequalities for the sum of the $2$-frugal chromatic numbers of $G$ and its complement from below and from above by functions of the order of $G$. For the upper bound $\chi_{2}^{f}(G)+\chi_{2}^{f}(\overline{G})\leq 3n/2$, we characterize the family of extremal graphs $G$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the metric geometry of the set of permutons under the rectangular distance $d_{\square}$. We determine the Chebyshev radius to be 1/4 and characterize all Chebyshev centers: a permuton is a center if and only if it is 1/2- periodic in each coordinate. We also describe permutons that attain the extremal distance 1/4 from a given center.</description>

      <title>Poset Partitions and the Combinatorics of the $\textbf{cd}$-Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Eulerian posets, called S-partitionable posets, which have a non-negative cd-index. These posets are a generalization of S-shellable complexes introduced by Stanley in 1994. We prove that S-partitionable posets have a non-negative cd-index via a recursive formula. Then, we introduce a semi-Eulerian version of S-partitionable posets, which we call SE-partitionable posets. We show that SE-partitionable posets also have a non-negative semi-Eulerian cd-index as defined by Juhnke-Kubitzke, Samper and Venturello in 2024.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to Hickingbotham's conjecture about $k$-ghost-edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and let $G$ be a connected graph with $tw(G)\leq k$. We say that $xy\in E(G^c)$ is a {\em $k$-ghost-edge} of $G$ if for every tree decomposition $(T,\cB)$ of $G$ with width at most $k$, the set $\{x,y\}$ is contained in a bag of $(T,\cB)$. Although a $k$-ghost-edge of $G$ is not an edge of $G$, but it behaves like real edges with respect to tree decomposition of $G$ with width at most $k$. For any graph $G$ with treewidth $k$ and $xy\in E(G^c)$, when there are at least $k+1$ internally vertex disjoint $(x,y)$-paths, Hickingbotham proved that $xy$ is a $k$-ghost-edge of $G$; while when there are at most $k$ internally vertex disjoint $(x,y)$-paths, he conjectured that it is not a $k$-ghost-edge of $G$. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture is wrong.</description>

      <title>The Simplicial Geometry of Integer Partitions: An Exact $O(1)$ Formula via $A_{k-1}$ Root Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structural resolution to the exact evaluation of the partition function $p_k(n)$, addressing the limitations of traditional recursive and asymptotic methods. By introducing the Simplicial Successive Decomposition (SSD) framework, we demonstrate that the partition polytope $\mathcal{P}_{n,k}$ is not an arbitrary geometric object, but admits a rigid minimal unimodular triangulation into exactly $N_k = \binom{k}{2}$ simplices. This cardinality is determined by the positive root system of the $A_{k-1}$ Weyl chamber.We decompose Euler's generating function into a finite sum of simplicial rational transforms. By applying Brion's localization theorem and the negative binomial expansion, we derive an exact closed-form formula with $O(1)$ computational complexity. The validity of the model is confirmed through Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity, ensuring accuracy in the "Core Collapse" regime where the polytope's interior is empty and continuous volume approximations are inapplicable.</description>

      <title>A mutation invariant for skew-symmetrizable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix mutation of skew-symmetrizable matrices is foundational in cluster algebra theory. Effective mutation invariants are essential for determining whether two matrices lie in the same mutation class. Casals~\cite{Casals} introduced a binary mutation invariant for skew-symmetric matrices. In this paper, we extend Casals' construction to the skew-symmetrizable setting. When the skew-symmetrizer $d_1,\dots, d_n$ is pairwise coprime, we obtain two distinct extensions of this invariant.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture about the strong odd chromatic number of planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper coloring of a graph $G$ is said to be a strong odd coloring of $G$, if for every vertex $v$ and every color $c$, either $c$ appears on an odd number of vertices in the neighborhood of $v$ or $c$ is absent in the neighborhood of $v$. The strong odd chromatic number of $G$ is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a strong odd coloring using $k$ colors. In this paper, we evaluate the strong odd chromatic number of join of cycles and empty graphs and one point union of graphs. Using these results, we construct infinite family of planar graphs that serves as counter examples to a recent conjecture regarding the upper bound of the strong odd chromatic number of planar graphs.</description>

      <title>The Mutual-Visibility Problem In Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mutual-visibility problem, originally defined for undirected graphs, asks for the size of the maximum set of vertices $S$ such that every pair of vertices in $S$ is connected by a shortest path passing only through vertices in $V \setminus S$. In this paper, we extend this concept to directed graphs, establishing fundamental results for several graph classes. We prove that for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), the mutual-visibility number $\mu(D)$ is always 1, and for directed cycles of length $n \geq 3$, it is strictly 2. In contrast, we demonstrate that tournaments can support arbitrarily large mutual-visibility sets; specifically, using properties of Paley tournaments, we show that $\mu(T)$ grows linearly with the size of the tournament. On the algorithmic side, we show that while verifying a candidate set is polynomial-time solvable ($O(|S|(|V|+|A|))$), the problem of determining $\mu(D)$ is NP-hard for general digraphs. We also analyze the impact of strong bridges and strongly connected components on the upper bounds of $\mu(D)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is an important fact that extremal discrete structures -- that is, discrete structures of maximal size among those that avoid certain configurations -- exhibit strong pseudorandom behavior. We present instances of this phenomenon in the context of graph-codes, a notion put forth recently by Alon, as well as on related problems related to density polynomial Hales--Jewett conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We present a determinantal formula for the number of spanning trees of a complete multipartite graph containing a given spanning forest $F$. Our approach relies on the Generalized Matrix Determinant Lemma and Jacobi's formula for the derivative of a determinant. This work generalizes known results for complete bipartite graphs and offers an algebraic perspective on the problem.</description>

      <title>Fel's Conjecture on Syzygies of Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S=\langle d_1,\dots,d_m\rangle$ be a numerical semigroup and $k[S]$ its semigroup ring. The Hilbert numerator of $k[S]$ determines normalized alternating syzygy power sums $K_p(S)$ encoding alternating power sums of syzygy degrees. Fel conjectured an explicit formula for $K_p(S)$, for all $p\ge 0$, in terms of the gap power sums $G_r(S)=\sum_{g\notin S} g^r$ and universal symmetric polynomials $T_n$ evaluated at the generator power sums $\sigma_k=\sum_i d_i^k$ (and $\delta_k=(\sigma_k-1)/2^k$). We prove Fel's conjecture via exponential generating functions and coefficient extraction, solating the universal identities for $T_n$ needed for the derivation. The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Kuratowski's theorem, a Kuratowski subgraph of a graph is a subgraph that is a subdivided $K_5$ or a subdivided $K_{3,3}$. An edge is crossing-critical if the crossing number decreases after removing the edge. In this note, we present the following examples: a graph with an edge that is crossed in every optimal drawing of the graph, but the edge is not in any Kuratowski subgraph of the graph; a graph with an edge that is in every Kuratowski subgraph but is not crossed in any optimal drawing of the graph; and a graph with a crossing-critical edge that is not present in any Kuratowski subgraph and is not crossed in any optimal drawing of the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H. Furstenberg introduced the notion of central sets in terms of topological dynamics and established the famous Central Sets Theorem. Later in [A new and stronger Central Sets Theorem, Fund. Math. 199 (2008), 155-175], D. De, N. Hindman, and D. Strauss established a stronger version of the Central Sets Theorem that uses the algebra of the Stone-\v Cech compactification of discrete semigroups. In this article, We will provide a new and combinatorial proof of the stronger Central Sets Theorem.</description>

      <title>Factor-balancedness, linear recurrence, and factor complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of infinite words, various notions of balancedness provide quantitative measures for how regularly letters or factors occur, and they find applications in several areas of mathematics and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berth\'e, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum.</description>

Abstract: An infinite integral domain $R$ is called a large ideal domain (LID) if every nontrivial ideal of $R$ has finite index in $R$. Recently, N. Hindman and D. Strauss have established a refinement of Moreira's theorem for the set of natural numbers and infinite fields. In this article, we prove the same result of N. Hindman and D. Strauss for large ideal domains (LID) and a polynomial extension.</description>

      <title>Minimum Number of Monochromatic Subgraphs of a Random Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing the number of monochromatic subgraphs of a random graph, when each node of the host graph is assigned one of the two colors. Using a recently discovered contiguity between appearance of strictly balanced subgraphs $F$ in a random graph, and random hypergraphs where copies of $F$ are generated independently, we show that the minimum value converges to a limit, when the expected number of copies of $F$ is linear in the number of nodes $|V|$. Furthermore, using the connections with mean field spin glass models, we obtain an asymptotic expression for this limit as the normalized expected number of copies of $F$ and the size of $F$ diverge to infinity.</description>

      <title>Highly symmetric unstable maniplexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A maniplex of rank n s an n-valent properly edge-coloured graph that generalises, simultaneously, maps on surfaces and abstract polytopes. The problem of stability in maniplexes is a natural variant of the problem of stability in graphs. A maniplex is stable if every automorphism of its canonical double cover is a lift of some automorphism of the original maniplex. Due to their very rich structure, regular (maximally symmetric) maniplexes are always stable. It is thus natural to ask what is the maximum possible degree of symmetry that a maniplex that is not stable can admit. Symmetry in maniplexes is usually measured by the number of orbits on flags (nodes) of their automorphism group. A few families of unstable maniplexes with 4 flag-orbits are known for rank 3. In this paper, we show that 2-orbit maniplexes exist for every rank n &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Excluding an apex-forest or a fan as quickly as possible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every graph $G$ excluding an apex-forest $H$ as a minor has layered pathwidth at most $|V(H)|-2$, and that every graph $G$ excluding an apex-linear forest (such as a fan) $H$ as a minor has layered treedepth at most $|V(H)|-2$. We further show that both bounds are optimal. These results improve on recent results of Hodor, La, Micek, and Rambaud (2025): The first result improves the previous best-known bound by a multiplicative factor of $2$, while the second strengthens a previous quadratic bound. In addition, we reduce from quadratic to linear the bound on the $S$-focused treedepth $\mathrm{td}(G,S)$ for graphs $G$ with a prescribed set of vertices $S$ excluding models of paths in which every branch set intersects~$S$.</description>

      <title>A two-player version of the assignment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the competitive assignment problem, a two-player version of the well-known assignment problem. Given a set of tasks and a set of agents with different efficiencies for different tasks, Alice and Bob take turns picking agents one by one. Once all agents have been picked, Alice and Bob compute the optimal values $s_A$ and $s_B$ for the assignment problem on their respective sets of agents, i.e. they assign their own agents to tasks (with at most one agent per task and at most one task per agent) so as to maximize the sum of the efficiencies. The score of the game is then defined as $s_A-s_B$. Alice aims at maximizing the score, while Bob aims at minimizing it. This problem can model drafts in sports and card games, or more generally situations where two entities fight for the same resources and then use them to compete against each other. We show that the problem is PSPACE-complete, even restricted to agents that have at most two nonzero efficiencies. On the other hand, in the case of agents having at most one nonzero efficiency, the problem lies in XP parameterized by the number of tasks, and the optimal score can be computed in linear time when there are only two tasks.</description>

      <title>Grid Diagrams of Fibered Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grid diagrams are special representations of knots in the three-sphere that are used to define a combinatorial version of knot Floer homology. Paolo Ghiggini and Yi Ni showed that knot Floer homology detects fibered knots. Their results imply, in particular, that grid diagrams with a unique grid state whose Alexander grading is maximal only exist for fibered knots. Whether every fibered knot admits such a diagram remains an open question. Here, we investigate the existence of such special grid diagrams for fibered knots. We develop an efficient method for deciding whether a given grid diagram meets the even stricter condition of having a unique grid state that realizes an upper bound for the Alexander function. By implementing this method in a Python package, we find suitable grid diagrams for 5385 of the 5397 fibered prime knots with crossing number at most 13.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space of $4 \times 4$ special orthogonal matrices with zeros on the diagonal decomposes into the union of $14$ irreducible surfaces whose intersections are beautifully encoded by the cuboctahedron. Using this decomposition, we exhibit a totally real witness set for $SO(4)$. We explain how to obtain a similar decomposition for $SO(5)$, where the $64$ components can be grouped to obtain such a correspondence with the face lattice of a $3$-polytope. We show that no such pattern exists for $SO(6)$.</description>

      <title>Refined invariants for Abelian surfaces: between polynomiality and modularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical refined invariants for toric surfaces, introduced Block and G{\"o}ttsche, are obtained couting tropical curves with a Laurent polynomial multiplicity. Brugall{\'e} and Jaramillo-Puentes then exhibited a polynomial behavior of the coefficients of this Laurent polynomial, seen as function on the curve degree. The authors provided explicit formula for small genus, involving quasi-modular forms. Inspired by the toric setting, the first-named author defined refined invariants for abelian surfaces and extended the polynomiality result. In this paper, we further study this regularity for abelian surfaces, providing explicit formulas involving quasi-modular forms. This resonates with the small genus cases of the toric setting.</description>

      <title>Vigemers: on the number of $k$-mers sharing the same XOR-based minimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bioinformatics, minimizers have become an inescapable method for handling $k$-mers (words of fixed size $k$) extracted from DNA or RNA sequencing, whether for sampling, storage, querying or partitioning. According to some fixed order on $m$-mers ($m&lt;k$), the minimizer of a $k$-mer is defined as its smallest $m$-mer -- and acts as its fingerprint. Although minimizers are widely used for partitioning purposes, there is almost no theoretical work on the quality of the resulting partitions. For instance, it has been known for decades that the lexicographic order empirically leads to highly unbalanced partitions that are unusable in practice, but it was not until very recently that this observation was theoretically substantiated. The rejection of the lexicographic order has led the community to resort to (pseudo-)random orders using hash functions. In this work, we extend the theoretical results relating to the partitions obtained by the lexicographical order, departing from it to a (exponentially) large family of hash functions, namely where the $m$-mers are XORed against a fixed key. More precisely, provided a key $\gamma$ and a $m$-mer $w$, we investigate the function that counts how many $k$-mers admit $w$ as their minimizer (i.e. where $w\oplus\gamma$ is minimal among all $m$-mers of said $k$-mers). This number, denoted by $\pi_k^{\gamma}(w)$, represents the maximum size of the bucket associated with $w$, if all possible $k$-mers were to be seen and partitioned. We adapt the (lexicographical order) method of the literature to our framework and propose combinatorial equations that allow to compute, using dynamic programming, $\pi_k^{\gamma}(w)$ in $O(km^2)$ time and $O(km)$ space.</description>

      <title>Universal Costas Matrices: Towards a General Framework for Costas Array Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Costas arrays are a special type of permutation matrices with ideal autocorrelation and low cross-correlation properties, making them valuable for radar, wireless communication, and integrated sensing and communication applications. This paper presents a novel unified framework for analyzing and discovering new Costas arrays. We introduce Universal Costas Matrices (UCMs) and Universal Costas Frequency Matrices (UCFMs) and investigate their structural characteristics. A framework integrating UCMs and UCFMs is proposed to pave the way for future artificial intelligence-assisted Costas array discovery. Leveraging the structural properties of UCMs and UCFMs, a reconstruction-based search method is developed to generate UCMs from UCFMs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly accelerates the search process and enhances structural insight into Costas array generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that a finite discrete convolution involving Stirling numbers of both kinds and harmonic numbers can be expressed in terms of the Bernoulli numbers. As applications of this expression, the linear recurrence relation for the Bernoulli numbers given by Agoh is reproved, and a new recurrence relation for the Bernoulli numbers is obtained. Furthermore, it is shown that a cumulative sum of the Bernoulli numbers can be written in terms of the Bernoulli and di-Bernoulli numbers. Finally, congruences for the sums of the Bernoulli and Euler numbers are established.</description>

Abstract: A set of points $S$ in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called a 2-distance set if the set of pairwise distances between the points has cardinality two. The 2-distance set is called spherical if its points lie on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. We characterize the spherical 2-distance sets using the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of an associated graph and the spectrum of the projection of the adjacency matrix onto the orthogonal complement of the all-ones vector. We also determine the lowest dimensional space in which a given spherical 2-distance set could be represented using the graph spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08651v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $s,t\in\mathbb{N}$, a complete bipartite poset $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$ is a poset whose Hasse diagram consists of $s$ pairwise incomparable vertices in the upper layer and $t$ pairwise incomparable vertices in the lower layer, such that every vertex in the upper layer is larger than all vertices in the lower layer. A family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^{[n]}$ is called induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$-saturated if $(\mathcal{F},\subseteq)$ contains no induced copy of $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$, whereas adding any set from $2^{[n]}\backslash\mathcal{F}$ to $\mathcal{F}$ creates an induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$. Let $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})$ denote the smallest size of an induced $\mathcal{K}_{s,t}$-saturated family $\mathcal{F}\subseteq2^{[n]}$. It was conjectured that $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})$ is superlinear in $n$ for certain values of $s$ and $t$. In this paper, we show that $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{K}_{s,t})=O(n)$ for all fixed $s,t\in\mathbb{N}$. Moreover, we prove a linear lower bound on $\mathrm{sat}^{*}(n,\mathcal{P})$ for a large class of posets $\mathcal{P}$, particularly for $\mathcal{K}_{s,2}$ with $s\in\mathbb{N}$.</description>

Abstract: An upward equilateral triangle of side $n$ can be partitioned into $n$ unit upward equilateral triangles and $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ unit rhombi with $60^{\circ}$ and $120^{\circ}$ angles. In this paper, we focus on understanding such partitions with a fixed arrangement of unit triangles. We formulate a criterion for such a partition being unique, identify a set of operations that connects all such partitions, and determine which parts are common to all such partitions. Additionally, we discuss an operation that connects all possible partitions with different arrangements of triangles.</description>

Abstract: We introduce path-conjoined graphs defined for two rooted graphs by joining their roots with a path, and investigate the chromatic symmetric functions of its two generalizations: spider-conjoined graphs and chain-conjoined graphs. By using the composition method developed by Zhou and the third author recently, we obtain neat positive $e_I$-expansions for the chromatic symmetric functions of clique-path-cycle graphs, path-clique-path graphs, and clique-clique-path graphs. We pose the $e$-positivity conjecture for hat-chains.</description>

      <title>Counting List Colorings of Unlabeled Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classic enumerative functions for counting colorings of a graph $G$, such as the chromatic polynomial $P(G,k)$, do so under the assumption that the given graph is labeled. In 1985, Hanlon defined and studied the chromatic polynomial for an unlabeled graph $\mathcal{G}$, $P(\mathcal{G}, k)$. Determining $P(\mathcal{G}, k)$ amounts to counting colorings under the action of automorphisms of $\mathcal{G}$. In this paper, we consider the problem of counting list colorings of unlabeled graphs. We extend Hanlon's definition to the list context and define the unlabeled list color function, $P_\ell(\mathcal{G}, k)$, of an unlabeled graph $\mathcal{G}$. In this context, we pursue a fundamental question whose analogues have driven much of the research on counting list colorings and its generalizations: For a given unlabeled graph $\mathcal{G}$, does $P_\ell(\mathcal{G}, k) = P(\mathcal{G}, k)$ when $k$ is large enough? We show the answer to this question is yes for a large class of unlabeled graphs that include point-determining graphs (also known as twin-free graphs, irreducible graphs, and mating graphs).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the deformed homogeneous polynomials $\mathrm{R}_{n}(x,y;u|q)$. These polynomials generalize some classical polynomials: the Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials $\mathrm{h}_{n}(x|q)$, the generalized Rogers-Szeg\"o polynomials $\mathrm{r}_{n}(x,y)$, the Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials $\mathrm{S}_{n}(x;q)$, among others. Basic properties of the polynomial $\mathrm{R}_{n}$ are given, along with recurrence relations, its $q$-difference equation, and representations. Generating functions for the polynomials $\mathrm{R}_{n}(x,y;u|q)$ are given. These functions include generalizations of the Mehler and Rogers formulas. In addition, generalizations of the $q$-binomial formula and the Heine transformation formula are obtained. These results are obtained via the $u$-deformed $q$-exponential operator $\mathrm{E}(yD_{q}|u)$, defined here. From this operator, we obtain for free the operators T$(yD_{q})$ the Chen, $\mathrm{R}(yD_{q})$ of Saad, $\mathcal{E}(yD_{q})$ of Exton, and $\mathcal{R}(yD_{q})$ of Rogers-Ramanujan when $u=1,q,\sqrt{q},q^2$, respectively. We introduce the deformed basic hypergeometric series ${}_{r}\Phi_{s}$, a generalization of the classical basic hypergeometric series. New transformation formulas for basic hypergeometric series are obtained.</description>

      <title>Path decompositions of oriented graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of decomposing the edges of a digraph into as few paths as possible. A natural lower bound for the number of paths in any path decomposition of a digraph $D$ is $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{v\in V(D)}|d^+(v)-d^-(v)|$; any digraph that achieves this bound is called consistent. Alspach, Mason, and Pullman conjectured in 1976 that every tournament of even order is consistent and this was recently verified for large tournaments by Gir\~ao, Granet, K\"uhn, Lo, and Osthus. A more general conjecture of Pullman states that for odd $d$, every orientation of a $d$-regular graph is consistent. We prove that the conjecture holds for random $d$-regular graphs with high probability i.e. for fixed odd $d$ and as $n \to \infty$ the conjecture holds for almost all $d$-regular graphs. Along the way, we verify Pullman's conjecture for graphs whose girth is sufficiently large (as a function of the degree).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ of graphs is a simplicial complex associated to a pair of graphs $G$ and $H$, and its homotopy type is of interest in the graph coloring problem and the homomorphism reconfiguration problem. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is a square-free connected graph, then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a point, a circle, $H$ or a connected double cover over $H$. We also obtain a certain relation between the fundamental group of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and realizable walks studied in the homomorphism reconfiguration problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The codegree Tur\'an density $\gamma(F)$ of a $k$-graph $F$ is the smallest $\gamma\in[0,1)$ such that every $k$-graph $H$ with $\delta_{k-1}(H)\geq(\gamma+o(1))\vert V(H)\vert$ contains a copy of $F$. We prove that for all $k,r\in\mathbb{N}$ with $k\geq3$, $\frac{r-1}{r}$ is an accumulation point of $\Gamma^{(k)}=\{\gamma(F):F\text{ is a }k\text{-graph}\}$. This makes progress on a problem posed by Mubayi and Zhao.</description>

      <title>On multiplicities of interpoint distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04283v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points and a distance $d&gt;0$, the multiplicity of $d$ is the number of times the distance $d$ appears between points in $X$. Let $a_1(X) \geq a_2(X) \geq \cdots \geq a_m(X)$ denote the multiplicities of the $m$ distances determined by $X$ and let $a(X)=\left(a_1(X),\dots,a_m(X)\right)$. In this paper, we study several questions from Erd\H{o}s's time regarding distance multiplicities. Among other results, we show that:
  (1) If $X$ is convex or ``not too convex'', then there exists a distance other than the diameter that has multiplicity at most $n$.
  (2) There exists a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that many distances occur with high multiplicity. In particular, at least $n^{\Omega(1/\log\log{n})}$ distances have superlinear multiplicity in $n$.
  (3) For any (not necessarily fixed) integer $1\leq k\leq\log{n}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, such that the difference between the $k^{\text{th}}$ and $(k+1)^{\text{th}}$ largest multiplicities is at least $\Omega(\frac{n\log{n}}{k})$. Moreover, the distances in $X$ with the largest $k$ multiplicities can be prescribed.
  (4) For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, there exists $X\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points, not all collinear or cocircular, such that $a(X)= (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$. There also exists $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ of $n$ points with pairwise distinct distance multiplicities and $a(Y) \neq (n-1,n-2,\ldots,1)$.</description>

      <title>Strongly regular and strongly walk-regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study perfect state transfer in Grover walks on two important classes of graphs: strongly regular graphs and strongly walk-regular graphs. The latter class is a generalization of the former. We first give a complete classification of strongly regular graphs that admit perfect state transfer. The only such graphs are the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$ and the complete tripartite graph $K_{2,2,2}$. We then show that, if a connected strongly walk-regular graph that is not a strongly regular graph admits perfect state transfer, then its spectrum must be of the form $\{[k]^1, [\frac{k}{2}]^{\alpha}, [0]^{\beta}, [-\frac{k}{2}]^{\gamma}\}$, and we enumerate all feasible spectra of this form up to $k=20$ with the help of a computer. These results are obtained using techniques from algebraic number theory and spectral graph theory, particularly through the analysis of eigenvalues and eigenprojections of a normalized adjacency matrix. While the setting is in quantum walks, the core discussion is developed entirely within the framework of spectral graph theory.</description>

      <title>Computing fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs using their primary subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metric dimension of a graph is the cardinality of a minimum resolving set, which is the set of vertices such that the distance representations of every vertex with respect to that set are unique. A fault-tolerant metric basis is a resolving set with a minimum cardinality that continues to resolve the graph even after the removal of any one of its vertices. The fault-tolerant metric dimension is the cardinality of such a fault-tolerant metric basis. In this article, we investigate the fault-tolerant metric dimension of graphs formed through the point-attaching process of primary subgraphs. This process involves connecting smaller subgraphs to specific vertices of a base graph, resulting in a more complex structure. By analyzing the distance properties and connectivity patterns, we establish explicit formulae for the fault-tolerant resolving sets of these composite graphs. Furthermore, we extend our results to specific graph products, such as rooted products. For these products, we determine the fault-tolerant metric dimension in terms of the fault-tolerant metric dimension of the primary subgraphs. Our findings demonstrate how the fault-tolerant dimension is influenced by the structural characteristics of the primary subgraphs and the attaching vertices. These results have potential applications in network design, error correction, and distributed systems, where robustness against vertex failures is crucial.</description>

      <title>On the variety of general position problems under vertex and edge removal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G)$, ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)$, and ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G)$ be the total, the outer, and the dual general position number of a graph $G$, respectively. This paper investigates how removing a vertex or removing an edge affects these graph invariants. It is proved that if $x$ is not a cut vertex, then ${\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) -1 \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G-x) \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) + {\rm deg}_G(x)$. On the other hand, ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G-x)$ and ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G-x)$ can be respectively arbitrarily larger/smaller than ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)$ and ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G)$. On the positive side, it is proved that if $x$ lies in some ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}$-set, then ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)-1 \le {\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G-x)$, and that if $x$ is not a cut vertex and lies in some ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}$-set of $G$, then $ {\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G)-1 \le {\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G-x)$. For the edge removal, it is proved that (i) ${\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) -|S(G)_{e}| \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G-e) \le {\rm gp}_{\rm t}(G) +2$, where $S(G)_{e}$ is the set of simplicial vertices adjacent to both endvertices of $e$, (ii) ${\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)/2\le {\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G-e)\leq\ 2{\rm gp}_{\rm o}(G)$, and (iii) that ${\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G) - {\rm gp}_{\rm d}(G-e)$ can be arbitrarily large. All bounds are demonstrated to be sharp.</description>

      <title>The complex of $r$-co-connected subgraphs, chordality and Fr\"oberg's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of pure simplicial complexes, called the $r$-co-connected complex of $G$ with respect to $A$, $\Sigma_r(A,G)$, where $r\geq 1$ is a natural number, $G$ is a simple graph, and $A$ is a subset of vertices. Interestingly, when $A$ is empty, this complex is precisely the Alexander dual of the $r$-independence complex of $G$. We focus on uncovering the relationship between the topological and combinatorial properties of the complex and the algebraic and homological properties of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the dual complex. First, we prove that $\Sigma_r(A,G)$ is vertex decomposable whenever the induced subgraph $G[A]$ is connected and nonempty, yielding a versatile deletion-link calculus for higher independence via Alexander duality. Furthermore, when $A=\emptyset$ and $r \ge 2$, we establish that for several significant classes of graphs - including chordal, co-chordal, cographs, cycles, complements of cycles, and certain grid graphs - the properties of vertex decomposability, shellability, and Cohen-Macaulayness are equivalent and precisely characterized by the co-chordality of the associated clutter $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$. These results extend Fr\"oberg's theorem to the setting of $r$-connected ideals for these graph classes and motivate a conjecture concerning the linear resolution property of $r$-connected ideals in general. We also construct examples separating shellability from vertex decomposability.</description>

      <title>On $\{k\}$-Roman graphs: complexity of recognition and the case of split graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $k$, a $\{k\}$-Roman dominating function of a graph $G = (V,E)$ is a function $f\colon V \rightarrow \{0,1,\ldots,k\}$ satisfying $f (N(v)) \geq k$ for each vertex $v\in V$ with $f (v) = 0$. Every graph $G$ satisfies $\gamma_{\{Rk\}}(G) \leq k\gamma(G)$, where $\gamma_{\{Rk\}}(G)$ denotes the minimum weight of a $\{k\}$-Roman dominating function of $G$ and $\gamma(G)$ is the domination number of $G$. In this work we study graphs for which the equality is reached, called \emph{$\{k\}$-Roman graphs}. This extends the concept of $\{k\}$-Roman trees studied by Wang et al. in 2021 to general graphs. We prove that for every $k\geq 3$, the problem of recognizing $\{k\}$-Roman graphs is NP-hard, even when restricted to split graphs. We provide partial answers to the question of which split graphs are $\{2\}$-Roman: we characterize $\{2\}$-Roman split graphs that can be decomposed with respect to the split join operation into two smaller split graphs and classify the $\{k\}$-Roman property within two specific families of split graphs that are prime with respect to the split join operation: suns and their complements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the starting points of this work was the duality of Borcea relating standard level $k$ representations of $A_1^{(1)}$ and level $2k+1$ of $A_2^{(2)}$. For $k=1$ the combinatorial bases in both cases yield the two Capparelli identities and we wanted to see if there is a correspondence between the bases in terms of partitions for all $k\in\mathbb N$. By using the vertex operator relations in the principal picture for level $5$ standard $A_2^{(2)}$-modules we reduce a spanning set of Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt-type vectors in $L(5\Lambda_0)$ by removing the leading terms of relations and rendering a list of 34 ``difference'' conditions for partitions.We have with computer programs sorted out the sets of partitions satisfying these conditions and formed the partial generating series which agrees with the principally specialized character for all powers of $q$ up to $41$. Although our list of leading terms is incomplete, our results show that the corresponding combinatorial identity for $L_{A_2^{(2)}}(5\Lambda_0)$ drastically differs from the one for the Borcea dual $L_{A_1^{(1)}}(2\Lambda_0)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chung and Graham [J. London Math. Soc. 1983] claimed to prove that there exists an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $ \frac{5}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n)$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph. Frati, Hoffmann and T\'oth [Combin. Probab. Comput. 2023] discovered an error in the proof. By adding more edges to $G$ the error can be corrected, bringing the number of edges in $G$ to $\frac{7}{2}n \log_2 n + O(n). $
  We make the first improvement to Chung and Graham's bound in over four decades by showing that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with $ \frac{14}{5}n \log_2 n + O(n) $ edges that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph.
  Furthermore, we generalise this bound for treewidth-$k$ graphs by showing that there exists a graph with $O(kn\log(n/k+1))$ edges that contains every $n$-vertex treewidth-$k$ graph as a subgraph. This is best possible in the sense that $\Omega(kn\log(n/k+1))$ edges are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide explicit and polynomial bounds for the Homogeneous Wall Lemma which occurred for the first time implicitly in the $13$th entry of Robertson and Seymour's Graph Minors Series [JCTB 1990] and has since become a cornerstone in the algorithmic theory of graph minors.
  A wall where each brick is assigned a set of colours is said to be homogeneous if each brick is assigned the same set of colours. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma says that there exists a function $h$ that, given non-negative integers $q$ and $k$ and an $h(q,k)$-wall $W$ where each brick is assigned a, possibly empty, subset of $\{ 1, \ldots , q \}$ contains a $k$-wall $W'$ as a subgraph such that, if one assigns to each brick $B$ of $W'$ the union of the sets assigned to the bricks of $W$ in its interior, then $W'$ is homogeneous. It is well-known that $h(q,k) \in k^{\mathcal{O}(q)}$. The Homogeneous Wall Lemma plays a key role in most applications of the Irrelevant Vertex Technique where an exponential dependency of $h$ on $q$ usually causes non-uniform dependencies on meta-parameters at best and additional exponential blow-ups at worst. By proving that $h(q,k) \in \mathcal{O}(q^4 \cdot k^6)$, we provide a positive answer to a problem raised by Sau, Stamoulis, and Thilikos [ICALP 2020].</description>

Abstract: We introduce two definitions of $G$-equivariant partitions of a finite $G$-set, both of which yield $G$-equivariant partition complexes. By considering suitable notions of equivariant trees, we show that $G$-equivariant partitions and $G$-trees are $G$-homotopy equivalent, generalizing existing results for the non-equivariant setting. Along the way, we develop equivariant versions of Quillen's Theorems A and B, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Threshold Qutrit Magic State Distillation Routines</title>

Abstract: Determining the best attainable threshold for qudit magic state distillation is directly related to the question of whether or not contextuality is sufficient for universal quantum computation. We show that the performance of a qudit correcting code for magic state distillation is captured by its complete weight enumerator. For the qutrit strange state -- a maximally magic non-stabilizer state -- the performance of a code is captured by its simple weight enumerator. This result allows us to carry out an extensive search for high-threshold magic state distillation routines for the strange state. Our search covers all $[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with a complete set of transversal Clifford gates for $n\leq 23$, and all $[[n,1]]_3$ stabilizer codes with a transversal $H^2$ gate with $n \leq 9$ qudits. For $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS codes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression. While none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code, their existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the qutrit strange state is somewhat generic.</description>

      <title>Period matrices and homological quasi-trees on discrete Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study discrete period matrices associated with graphs cellularly embedded on closed surfaces, resembling classical period matrices of Riemann surfaces. Defined via integrals of discrete harmonic 1-forms, these period matrices are known to encode discrete conformal structure in the sense of circle patterns. We obtain a combinatorial interpretation of the discrete period matrix, where its minors are expressed as weighted sums over certain spanning subgraphs, which we call homological quasi-trees. Furthermore, we relate the period matrix to the determinant of the Laplacian for a flat complex line bundle. We derive a combinatorial analogue of the Weil-Petersson potential on the Teichm\"uller space, expressed as a weighted sum over homological quasi-trees. Finally, we study the collection of homological quasi-trees from a (delta-)matroidal perspective. The discrete period matrix plays a role similar to that of the response matrix in circular planar networks, thereby addressing a question posed by Richard Kenyon.</description>
