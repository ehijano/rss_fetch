      <title>Development of an Estimation Method for the Seismic Motion Reproducibility of a Three-dimensional Ground Structure Model by combining Surface-observed Seismic Motion and Three-dimensional Seismic Motion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground structure can substantially influence seismic ground motion underscoring the need to develop a ground structure model with sufficient reliability in terms of ground motion estimation for earthquake damage mitigation. While many methods for generating ground structure models have been proposed and used in practice, there remains room for enhancing their reliability. In this study, amid many candidate 3D ground structure models generated from geotechnical engineering knowledge, we propose a method for selecting a credible 3D ground structure model capable of reproducing observed earthquake ground motion, utilizing seismic ground motion data solely observed at the ground surface and employing 3D seismic ground motion analysis. Through a numerical experiment, we illustrate the efficacy of this approach. By conducting $10^2$-$10^3$ cases of fast 3D seismic wave propagation analyses using graphic processing units (GPUs), we demonstrate that a credible 3D ground structure model is selected according to the quantity of seismic motion information. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by showing that the accuracy of seismic motions using ground structure models that were selected from the pool of candidate models is higher than that using ground structure models that were not selected from the pool of candidate models.</description>

      <title>A Formal Specification of a Data Model for Malaria Surveillance in the Developing World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fourth Industrial Revolution(4IR), together with the COVID-19 pandemic have made a loud call for digitizing diagnosis processes. The world is now convinced that it is imperative to digitize the diagnosis of long standing diseases such as malaria for more efficient treatment and control. It has been seen that malaria control would benefit a lot from digitizing its diagnosis processes such as data gathering. We propose, in this paper, the architecture of a digital data collection system and how it is used to gather data for malaria awareness. The system is formally specified using Z notation, and based on the capability of the system, possible malaria determinants are defined and their retrieving mechanisms are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the suitability of single-edge notch tension (SENT) testing for assessing hydrogen-assisted cracking susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combined experiments and computational modelling are used to increase understanding of the suitability of the Single-Edge Notch Tension (SENT) test for assessing hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. The SENT tests were designed to provide the mode I threshold stress intensity factor ($K_{\text{th}}$) for hydrogen-assisted cracking of a C110 steel in two corrosive environments. These were accompanied by hydrogen permeation experiments to relate the environments to the absorbed hydrogen concentrations. A coupled phase-field-based deformation-diffusion-fracture model is then employed to simulate the SENT tests, predicting $K_{\text{th}}$ in good agreement with the experimental results and providing insights into the hydrogen absorption-diffusion-cracking interactions. The suitability of SENT testing and its optimal characteristics (e.g., test duration) are discussed in terms of the various simultaneous active time-dependent phenomena, triaxiality dependencies, and regimes of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility.</description>

      <title>VoroTO: Multiscale Topology Optimization of Voronoi Structures using Surrogate Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular structures found in nature exhibit remarkable properties such as high strength, high energy absorption, excellent thermal/acoustic insulation, and fluid transfusion. Many of these structures are Voronoi-like; therefore researchers have proposed Voronoi multi-scale designs for a wide variety of engineering applications. However, designing such structures can be computationally prohibitive due to the multi-scale nature of the underlying analysis and optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a neural network (NN) to carry out efficient topology optimization (TO) of multi-scale Voronoi structures. The NN is first trained using Voronoi parameters (cell site locations, thickness, orientation, and anisotropy) to predict the homogenized constitutive properties. This network is then integrated into a conventional TO framework to minimize structural compliance subject to a volume constraint. Special considerations are given for ensuring positive definiteness of the constitutive matrix and promoting macroscale connectivity. Several numerical examples are provided to showcase the proposed method.</description>

      <title>ECC Analyzer: Extract Trading Signal from Earnings Conference Calls using Large Language Model for Stock Performance Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of financial analytics, leveraging unstructured data, such as earnings conference calls (ECCs), to forecast stock performance is a critical challenge that has attracted both academics and investors. While previous studies have used deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our study introduces a novel framework: \textbf{ECC Analyzer}, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal techniques to extract richer, more predictive insights. The model begins by summarizing the transcript's structure and analyzing the speakers' mode and confidence level by detecting variations in tone and pitch for audio. This analysis helps investors form an overview perception of the ECCs. Moreover, this model uses the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based methods to meticulously extract the focuses that have a significant impact on stock performance from an expert's perspective, providing a more targeted analysis. The model goes a step further by enriching these extracted focuses with additional layers of analysis, such as sentiment and audio segment features. By integrating these insights, the ECC Analyzer performs multi-task predictions of stock performance, including volatility, value-at-risk (VaR), and return for different intervals. The results show that our model outperforms traditional analytic benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of using advanced LLM techniques in financial analytics.</description>

      <title>A Port-Hamiltonian System Perspective on Electromagneto-Quasistatic Field Formulations of Darwin-Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagneto-quasistatic (EMQS) field formulations are often dubbed as Darwin-type field formulations which approximate the Maxwell equations by neglecting radiation effects while modelling resistive, capacitive, and inductive effects. A common feature of EMQS field models is the Darwin-Amp\'ere equation formulated with the magnetic vector potential and the electric scalar potential. EMQS field formulations yield different approximations to the Maxwell equations by choice of additional gauge equations. These EMQS formulations are analyzed within the port-Hamiltonian system (PHS) framework. It is shown via the PHS compatibility equation that formulations based on the combination of the Darwin-Amp\'ere equation and the full Maxwell continuity equation yield port-Hamiltonian systems implying numerical stability and specific EMQS energy conservation.</description>

      <title>Trust Dynamics and Market Behavior in Cryptocurrency: A Comparative Study of Centralized and Decentralized Exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of digital finance, the transition from centralized to decentralized trust mechanisms, primarily driven by blockchain technology, plays a critical role in shaping the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This paradigm shift raises questions about the traditional reliance on centralized trust and introduces a novel, decentralized trust framework built upon distributed networks. Our research delves into the consequences of this shift, particularly focusing on how incidents influence trust within cryptocurrency markets, thereby affecting trade behaviors in centralized (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). We conduct a comprehensive analysis of various events, assessing their effects on market dynamics, including token valuation and trading volumes in both CEXs and DEXs. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of trust in directing user preferences and the fluidity of trust transfer between centralized and decentralized platforms. Despite certain anomalies, the results largely align with our initial hypotheses, revealing the intricate nature of user trust in cryptocurrency markets. This study contributes significantly to interdisciplinary research, bridging distributed systems, behavioral finance, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It offers valuable insights for the distributed computing community, particularly in understanding and applying distributed trust mechanisms in digital economies, paving the way for future research that could further explore the socio-economic dimensions and leverage blockchain data in this dynamic domain.</description>

      <title>Impact of Traffic-Following on Order of Autonomous Airspace Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamic emergence of traffic order in a distributed multi-agent system, aiming to minimize inefficiencies that stem from unnecessary structural impositions. We introduce a methodology for developing a dynamically-updating traffic pattern map of the airspace by leveraging information about the consistency and frequency of flow directions used by current as well as preceding traffic. Informed by this map, an agent can discern the degree to which it is advantageous to follow traffic by trading off utilities such as time and order. We show that for the traffic levels studied, for low degrees of traffic-following behavior, there is minimal penalty in terms of aircraft travel times while improving the overall orderliness of the airspace. On the other hand, heightened traffic-following behavior may result in increased aircraft travel times, while marginally reducing the overall entropy of the airspace. Ultimately, the methods and metrics presented in this paper can be used to optimally and dynamically adjust an agent's traffic-following behavior based on these trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Time Machine GPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on extensive, temporally indiscriminate text corpora, reflecting the lack of datasets with temporal metadata. This approach is not aligned with the evolving nature of language. Conventional methods for creating temporally adapted language models often depend on further pre-training static models on time-specific data. This paper presents a new approach: a series of point-in-time LLMs called Time Machine GPT (TiMaGPT), specifically designed to be nonprognosticative. This ensures they remain uninformed about future factual information and linguistic changes. This strategy is beneficial for understanding language evolution and is of critical importance when applying models in dynamic contexts, such as time-series forecasting, where foresight of future information can prove problematic. We provide access to both the models and training datasets.</description>

      <title>A Scoping Review on Simulation-based Design Optimization in Marine Engineering: Trends, Best Practices, and Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This scoping review assesses the current use of simulation-based design optimization (SBDO) in marine engineering, focusing on identifying research trends, methodologies, and application areas. Analyzing 277 studies from Scopus and Web of Science, the review finds that SBDO is predominantly applied to optimizing marine vessel hulls, including both surface and underwater types, and extends to key components like bows, sterns, propellers, and fins. It also covers marine structures and renewable energy systems. A notable trend is the preference for deterministic single-objective optimization methods, indicating potential growth areas in multi-objective and stochastic approaches. The review points out the necessity of integrating more comprehensive multidisciplinary optimization methods to address the complex challenges in marine environments. Despite the extensive application of SBDO in marine engineering, there remains a need for enhancing the methodologies' efficiency and robustness. This review offers a critical overview of SBDO's role in marine engineering and highlights opportunities for future research to advance the field.</description>

      <title>From Density to Geometry: YOLOv8 Instance Segmentation for Reverse Engineering of Optimized Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces YOLOv8-TO, a novel approach for reverse engineering of topology-optimized structures into interpretable geometric parameters using the YOLOv8 instance segmentation model. Density-based topology optimization methods require post-processing to convert the optimal density distribution into a parametric representation for design exploration and integration with CAD tools. Traditional methods such as skeletonization struggle with complex geometries and require manual intervention. YOLOv8-TO addresses these challenges by training a custom YOLOv8 model to automatically detect and reconstruct structural components from binary density distributions. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of both optimized and random structures generated using the Moving Morphable Components method. A custom reconstruction loss function based on the dice coefficient of the predicted geometry is used to train the new regression head of the model via self-supervised learning. The method is evaluated on test sets generated from different topology optimization methods, including out-of-distribution samples, and compared against a skeletonization approach. Results show that YOLOv8-TO significantly outperforms skeletonization in reconstructing visually and structurally similar designs. The method showcases an average improvement of 13.84% in the Dice coefficient, with peak enhancements reaching 20.78%. The method demonstrates good generalization to complex geometries and fast inference times, making it suitable for integration into design workflows using regular workstations. Limitations include the sensitivity to non-max suppression thresholds. YOLOv8-TO represents a significant advancement in topology optimization post-processing, enabling efficient and accurate reverse engineering of optimized structures for design exploration and manufacturing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how well a physics-based simulator can replicate a real wheel loader performing bucket filling in a pile of soil. The comparison is made using field test time series of the vehicle motion and actuation forces, loaded mass, and total work. The vehicle was modeled as a rigid multibody system with frictional contacts, driveline, and linear actuators. For the soil, we tested discrete element models of different resolutions, with and without multiscale acceleration. The spatio-temporal resolution ranged between 50-400 mm and 2-500 ms, and the computational speed was between 1/10,000 to 5 times faster than real-time. The simulation-to-reality gap was found to be around 10% and exhibited a weak dependence on the level of fidelity, e.g., compatible with real-time simulation. Furthermore, the sensitivity of an optimized force feedback controller under transfer between different simulation domains was investigated. The domain bias was observed to cause a performance reduction of 5% despite the domain gap being about 15%.</description>

      <title>A cable finite element formulation based on exact tension field for static nonlinear analysis of cable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a numerical exact cable finite element model for the static nonlinear analysis of cable structures. In this model, the exact expression of the tension field is derived based on the geometrically exact beam theory and the fundamental mechanical properties of cables. The equation system of the cable element is established by considering the equilibrium conditions at the element boundaries and the compatibility condition within the element. In contrast to existing research, which often focuses on providing explicit expressions for the cable model, the present work aims to provide a cable element formulation with numerical accuracy and a wider range of applicability. This is achieved by directly deriving the linearized equations of the element with the implicit expressions that include integrals. The proposed cable element is capable of solving for internal forces and deformation states, and can also be used to determine the unstrained length of the cable. Meanwhile, it can also include the effect of non-uniform cross-sectional stiffness along the cable axis. The implementations of solutions based on complete tangent matrix and element internal iteration are introduced, and the efficacy of the proposed cable element is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks with curriculum training for poroelastic flow and deformation processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a highly active research topic across multiple disciplines in science and engineering, including computational geomechanics. PINNs offer a promising approach in different applications where faster, near real-time or real-time numerical prediction is required. Examples of such areas in geomechanics include geotechnical design optimization, digital twins of geo-structures and stability prediction of monitored slopes. But there remain challenges in training of PINNs, especially for problems with high spatial and temporal complexity. In this paper, we study how the training of PINNs can be improved by using an idealized poroelasticity problem as a demonstration example. A curriculum training strategy is employed where the PINN model is trained gradually by dividing the training data into intervals along the temporal dimension. We find that the PINN model with curriculum training takes nearly half the time required for training compared to conventional training over the whole solution domain. For the particular example here, the quality of the predicted solution was found to be good in both training approaches, but it is anticipated that the curriculum training approach has the potential to offer a better prediction capability for more complex problems, a subject for further research.</description>

      <title>Toward a Mapping of Capability and Skill Models using Asset Administration Shells and Ontologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to react efficiently to changes in production, resources and their functions must be integrated into plants in accordance with the plug and produce principle. In this context, research on so-called capabilities and skills has shown promise. However, there are currently two incompatible approaches to modeling capabilities and skills. On the one hand, formal descriptions using ontologies have been developed. On the other hand, there are efforts to standardize submodels of the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) for this purpose. In this paper, we present ongoing research to connect these two incompatible modeling approaches. Both models are analyzed to identify comparable as well as dissimilar model elements. Subsequently, we present a concept for a bidirectional mapping between AAS submodels and a capability and skill ontology. For this purpose, two unidirectional, declarative mappings are applied that implement transformations from one modeling approach to the other - and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Lagrangian Turbulence by Generative Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Lagrangian turbulence lies at the core of numerous applied and fundamental problems related to the physics of dispersion and mixing in engineering, bio-fluids, atmosphere, oceans, and astrophysics. Despite exceptional theoretical, numerical, and experimental efforts conducted over the past thirty years, no existing models are capable of faithfully reproducing statistical and topological properties exhibited by particle trajectories in turbulence. We propose a machine learning approach, based on a state-of-the-art diffusion model, to generate single-particle trajectories in three-dimensional turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, thereby bypassing the need for direct numerical simulations or experiments to obtain reliable Lagrangian data. Our model demonstrates the ability to reproduce most statistical benchmarks across time scales, including the fat-tail distribution for velocity increments, the anomalous power law, and the increased intermittency around the dissipative scale. Slight deviations are observed below the dissipative scale, particularly in the acceleration and flatness statistics. Surprisingly, the model exhibits strong generalizability for extreme events, producing events of higher intensity and rarity that still match the realistic statistics. This paves the way for producing synthetic high-quality datasets for pre-training various downstream applications of Lagrangian turbulence.</description>

      <title>MLQAOA: Graph Learning Accelerated Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multilevel QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning the problem structure at multiple levels of coarseness to inform the decomposition-based hybrid quantum-classical combinatorial optimization solvers is a promising approach to scaling up variational approaches. We introduce a multilevel algorithm reinforced with the spectral graph representation learning-based accelerator to tackle large-scale graph maximum cut instances and fused with several versions of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and QAOA-inspired algorithms. The graph representation learning model utilizes the idea of QAOA variational parameters concentration and substantially improves the performance of QAOA. We demonstrate the potential of using multilevel QAOA and representation learning-based approaches on very large graphs by achieving high-quality solutions in a much faster time.
