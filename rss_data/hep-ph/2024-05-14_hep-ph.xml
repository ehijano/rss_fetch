      <title>One-photon annihilation of the electron-positron pair at heavy atomic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate one-photon annihilation of the electron-positron pair in the field of a central, very heavy and positively charged atomic nucleus. The explicit formula for the annihilation rate of this process $\Gamma^{(b)}_{1 \gamma}$ is derived. Our formula for this rate can directly be used to describe the actual one-photon annihilation in the ground (bound) states of all positronium hydrides HPs, quasi-stable triplet states of the positron-helium atoms $e^{+}[$ He($2^{3}S_e$)] ions and other systems.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Odderon results based on new TOTEM data on elastic pp collisions at 8 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating the H(x, s; pp) scaling function of elastic proton-proton (pp) collisions from recent TOTEM data at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV and comparing it with the same function of elastic proton-antiproton (pp-) data of the D0 collaboration at sqrt(s) = 1.96 TeV, we find, from this comparison alone, an at least 3.79 sigma {\signal} of Odderon exchange. If we combine this model independently obtained result with that of a similar analysis but using TOTEM elastic pp scattering data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV, which resulted in an at least 6.26 {\sigma} signal, the combined significance of Odderon exchange increases to at least 7.08 {\sigma}, model independently. Further combinations of various datasets in the TeV energy range are detailed in the manuscript</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Probe of Dark Matter in Interferometer Missions: Fisher Forecast and MCMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) spectral shapes at interferometer-based current and future GW missions to test dark matter (DM) production and baryogenesis via gravity-portal. We consider three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), the lightest among them is DM candidate while the others participate in baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that future GW detectors BBO, DECIGO, ET, for instance, are able to probe DM mass for $5\times 10^6\, {\rm GeV}&lt;M_{\rm DM}&lt;1.6\times 10^7$ GeV with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) $&gt;10$, along with the observed amount of baryon asymmetry due to gravitational leptogenesis for heavy RHN mass $M_{\cal{N}}$ to be around $8\times 10^{12}$ GeV. Employing Fisher matrix forecast analysis, we identify the parameter space involving non-minimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, reheating temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ and DM mass $M_{\rm DM}$ where the GW detector-sensitivities will be the maximum with the least error, along with SNR $&gt;10$. Finally, utilizing mock data for each GW detector, we perform MCMC analysis to find out the combined constraints on the various microphysics parameters. We also explore production of other cosmological relics such as QCD axion relic as DM candidate, produced via gravity-portal in early universe. We find that ET, for instance, can probe the decay constant of such DM candidates ($f_a$) as $10^9\,{\rm GeV}\lesssim f_a\lesssim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$ for misalignment angle $\theta_i\in[0.1,\pi/\sqrt{3}]$ and $\xi=1$ with SNR $&gt;10$, whereas this range decreases with the increase of non-minimal coupling. Thus the upcoming GW missions will be able to test such non-thermal DM and baryogenesis scenarios involving very high energy scales, which is otherwise impossible to reach in particle physics experiments in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Disentangling new physics in $K\rightarrow\pi\bar{\nu}\nu$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)\bar{\nu}\nu$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of disentangling different new physics contributions to the rare meson decays $K\rightarrow\pi+\displaystyle{\not}E$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)+\displaystyle{\not}E$ through kinematic distributions in the missing energy $\displaystyle{\not}E$. We employ dimension-$6$ operators within the Low-Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT), identifying the invisible part of the final state as either active or sterile neutrinos. Special emphasis is given to lepton-number violating (LNV) operators with scalar and tensor currents. We show analytically that contributions from scalar, vector, and tensor quark currents can be uniquely determined from experimental data of kinematic distributions. In addition, we present new correlations of branching ratios for $K$ and $B$-decays involving scalar and tensor currents. As there could a priori also be new invisible particles in the final states, we include dark-sector operators giving rise to two dark scalars, fermions, or vectors in the final state. In this context, we present new calculations of the inclusive decay rate $B\rightarrow X_s+\displaystyle{\not}E$ for dark operators. We show that careful measurements of kinematic distributions make it theoretically possible to disentangle the contribution from LEFT operators from most of the dark-sector operators, even when multiple operators are contributing. We revisit sum rules for vector currents in LEFT and show that the latter are also satisfied in some new dark-physics scenarios that could mimic LEFT. Finally, we point out that an excess in rare meson decays consistent with a LNV hypothesis would point towards highly flavor non-democratic physics in the UV, and could put high-scale leptogenesis under tension.</description>

      <title>Nelson-Barr ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in the Nelson-Barr solution to the strong CP-problem, a naturally light scalar can arise. It gives rise to a completely new phenomenology beyond that of the celebrated QCD axion, if this field constitutes dark matter, as the CKM elements vary periodically in time. We also discuss how the model can be tested using quantum sensors, in particular using nuclear clocks, which leads to an interesting synergy between different frontiers of physics.</description>

      <title>Hadronic energy-momentum tensor revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Everything gravitates and they do so through the energy-momentum tensor (EMT). However, there is no consensus on how to define the EMT of a hadron, e.g. the proton, the fundamental building blocks of the visible world. In this work, we show that the hadronic EMT can be cast into the form of relativistic continua with spin. The fluid-like form allows a clear identification of the proper hadronic energy density, pressure and shear. A spin tensor contribution is also identified without the reference to the total angular momentum operator, in alignment with the recent development in relativistic spin hydrodynamics. The hadronic EMT is related to the quantum expectation value of the EMT operator through the convolution with the hadronic wavepacket. To factorize out the hadronic EMT, different multipole expansion schemes are explored. We show that the popular Breit-frame densities and light-front densities emerge as the monopole momentum densities from different factorization schemes.</description>

      <title>Energy momentum tensor on and off the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$ and $\bar c_i$ of a scalar theory using both the light-cone and covariant perturbation theory at the one-loop level. The light-cone formalism provides a potential approach to access these form factors beyond the perturbative regime. However, unlike the covariant formulation, the Poincar\'e symmetry on the light cone is not manifest. In this work, we use perturbation theory as a benchmark to extract the gravitational form factors from the light-front energy-momentum tensor. By comparing results on and off the light cone, we identify $T^{++}, T^{+a}, T^{+-}, T^{12}$ as the "good currents" that are properly renormalized and can be used to extract the gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Investigation on the $\Omega(2012)$ from QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the recently observed $\Omega(2012)$ baryon in QCD sum rules. We construct the $P$-wave $\Omega$ baryon currents with a covariant derivative, and perform spin projection to obtain the currents with total spin 1/2 and 3/2. We then apply the parity-projected QCD sum rules to separate the contributions of the positive and negative parity states. We extract the masses of $J^P = 1/2^-$ and $3/2^-$ states to be $M_{1/2^-} = 2.07^{+0.07}_{-0.07}{\rm~GeV}$ and $M_{3/2^-} = 2.05^{+0.09}_{-0.10}{\rm~GeV}$. Both results are in good agreement with the experimental result. Therefore, it is likely that the $\Omega(2012)$ is a negative parity state, which is interpreted as a $P$-wave excited state in the quark model. However, its spin is not determined in the present analysis, which can be done by detailed study on its decay properties.</description>

      <title>Leptoquark-induced CLFV decays with a light SM-singlet scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM), if augmented with a light SM-singlet scalar $\phi$, 2-body charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) decay channels can be accessed with $\phi$ as one of the final states. The effective ineteractions between $\phi$ and the SM fields can arise at TeV-scale where the governing theory extends the SM particle spectrum with a scalar leptoquark (LQ) $S_1$. Further, in the presence of $S_1$, $\phi$ can mediate 3-body CLFV processes with either two photons or two gluons in the final states. Thus, the model predicts an exotic 3-body CLFV channel: $\ell_A\to\ell_B gg$, which can be tested/constrained only through some future experiments looking for di-gluon signal from a leptonic decay.</description>

      <title>Release Note -- VBFNLO 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VBFNLO is a flexible parton level Monte Carlo program for the simulation of vector boson fusion (VBF), QCD-induced single and double vector boson production plus two jets, and double and triple vector boson production (plus jet) in hadronic collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant, as well as Higgs boson plus two and three jet production via gluon fusion at the one-loop level. For the new version -- Version 3.0.0 -- several major enhancements have been included. An interface according to the Binoth Les Houches Accord (BLHA) has been added for all VBF and di/tri-boson processes including fully leptonic decays. For all dimension-8 operators affecting vector boson scattering (VBS) processes, a modified T-matrix unitarization procedure has been implemented. Several new production processes have been added, namely the VBS $Z\gamma jj$ and $\gamma \gamma jj$ processes at NLO, $\gamma \gamma jj $, $WWj$ and $ZZj$ production at NLO including the loop-induced gluon-fusion contributions and the gluon-fusion one-loop induced $\Phi jjj$ ($\Phi$ is a CP-even or CP-odd scalar boson) process at LO, retaining the full top-mass dependence. Finally, the code has been parallelized using OPENMPI.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Dissociation and Transition of Heavy Quarkonia in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the dissociation of heavy quarkonia by thermal partons at the next-to-leading order (NLO, also known as inelastic parton scattering dissociation) in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). Utilizing the chromo-electric dipole coupling from QCD multipole expansion as an effective Hamiltonian, this has been conducted in the approach of second-order quantum mechanical perturbation theory, which allows us to systematically incorporate the bound state wave functions. Employing the quarkonium wave functions and binding energies obtained from an in-medium potential model, we then numerically evaluate the dissociation cross sections and rates for various charmonia and bottomonia, where the infrared and collinear divergences are regularized by the thermal masses of medium partons. We demonstrate that distinct from the leading order (LO, also known as gluo-dissociation) counterparts peaking at relatively low gluon energy and falling off thereafter, the NLO cross sections first grow and then nearly saturate as the incident parton energy increases, as a result of the outgoing parton carrying away the excess energy. The resulting NLO dissociation rates increase with temperature and take over from the LO counterparts toward high temperatures, similar to pertinent findings from previous studies. We also evaluate the in-medium second-order transition between different bound states, which may contribute to the total thermal decay widths of heavy quarkonia in the QGP.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Physics in General NMSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the General Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (GNMSSM), singlet particles may form a secluded sector of dark matter (DM), in which Singlino-like DM could achieve the observed relic abundance through various channels such as $\tilde{\chi}_1^0 \tilde{\chi}_1^0 \to h_s h_s, A_s A_s, h_s A_s$, where $h_s$ and $A_s$ represent singlet-dominated CP-even and CP-odd Higgs bosons. We provide analytical formulas for both the spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections of Singlino DM scattering with nucleons, illustrating their dependence on the model's parameters in a clear manner. We also present analytic expressions for the annihilation cross sections of these three important channels. Based on these preparations, we conducted Bayesian analyses of the GNMSSM and concluded that the theory significantly favored Singlino-dominated DM over Bino-like DM across a much broader range of parameters. The combined results from our numerical analyses and the formulas distinctly highlight crucial aspects of DM physics within the GNMSSM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the discovery of hidden-charm strange pentaquarks, we conduct a systematic study of the magnetic moments of the hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks in molecular picture. We calculate magnetic moments of hidden-bottom strange pentaquarks with strangeness-1 and 2. Magnetic moment gives valuable information about the inner structure and shape of the hadron. The obtained results may be helpful to determine the inner structure of these new yet hypothetical states.</description>

      <title>A Potential Model Study of the Nucleon's Charge and Mass Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the charge and mass distributions within a nucleon and compute the associated squared radii based on a potential model approach. Different constituent quark configurations such as $\Delta$, $Y$, and quark-diquark are considered and compared, with model parameters calibrated by experimental measurements of the proton and neutron charge radius. The results suggest that while the charge radius is dictated by quark dynamics, the mass radius is strongly influenced by nonperturbative QCD contributions to a nucleon's mass that are not sensitive to the constituent quarks. As a result, the mass radius could become substantially different from the charge radius. The obtained nucleon mass distributions of different configurations are further used for simulations of the initial conditions in heavy ion collisions. The computed eccentricities $\varepsilon_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ are found to demonstrate a considerable sensitivity to the input nucleon profiles, especially to the mass radius in the peripheral region as well as for systems with fewer participants.</description>

      <title>Searching for $|V_{cd}|$ through the exclusive decay $D_s^+ \to K^0e^+\nu_e$ within QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we carry out an investigation into the semileptonic decays $D_s^+ \to K^0\ell^+\nu_\ell$ with $\ell=(e,\mu)$ by employing the QCD light-cone sum rules approach. The vector transition form factor (TFF) $f_+^{D_s^+ K^0}(q^2)$ for $D_s^+\to K^0$ decay is calculated while considering its next-to-leading order contribution. Subsequently, we briefly introduce the twist-2, 3 kaon distribution amplitudes, which are calculated by using QCD sum rules within the framework of the background field theory. At the large recoil point, the TFF has $f_+^{D_s^+ K^0}(0)=0.692_{-0.026}^{+0.027}$. Then, we extrapolate $f_+^{D_s^+ K^0}(q^2)$ to the whole physical $q^2$-region via the simplified $z(q^2,t)$-series expansion, and the behavior of TFF $f_+^{D_s^+ K^0}(q^2)$ is exhibited in the numerical results part, including the theoretical and experimental predictions for comparison. In addition, we compute the differential branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to K^0\ell^+\nu_\ell)$ with the electron and muon channels, which are expected to be $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to K^0e^+\nu_e)=3.379_{-0.275}^{+0.301}\times 10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to K^0\mu^+\nu_\mu)=3.351_{-0.273}^{+0.299}\times 10^{-3}$ as well as contained other results for comparison. Our results show good agreement with the BESIII measurements and theoretical predictions. Furthermore, we present our prediction with respect to the CKM matrix element $|V_{cd}|$ by using the $\mathcal{B}(D_s^+ \to K^0e^+\nu_e)$ result from BESIII Collaboration, yielding $|V_{cd}|=0.221_{-0.010}^{+0.008}$. Finally, we provide the ratio between $D_s^+ \to K^0e^+\nu_e$ and $D_s^+ \to \eta e^+\nu_e$ channels, i.e. $\mathcal{R}_{K^0/\eta}^e=0.144_{-0.020}^{+0.028}$.</description>

      <title>Minimal Type-I Dirac seesaw and Leptogenesis under $A_{4}$ modular invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Dirac mass model based on $A_{4}$ modular symmetry within Type-I seesaw framework. This extension of Standard Model requires three right-handed neutrinos and three heavy Dirac fermions superfields, all singlet under $SU(2)_{L}$ symmetry. The scalar sector is extended by the inclusion of a $SU(2)_{L}$ singlet superfield, $\chi$. Here, the modular symmetry plays a crucial role as the Yukawa couplings acquire modular forms, which are expressed in terms of Dedekind eta function $\eta(\tau)$. Therefore, the Yukawa couplings follow transformations akin to other matter fields, thereby obviating the necessity of additional flavon fields. The acquisition of $vev$ by complex modulus $\tau$ leads to the breaking of $A_{4}$ modular symmetry. We have obtained predictions on neutrino oscillation parameters, for example, the model favours ( \theta_{23} ) to be in the lower octant and normal hierarchy for neutrino mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that heavy Dirac fermions, in our model, can decay to produce observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe through Dirac leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Kaon superfluidity in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously, it was found that pion superfluidity could be realized in the QCD epoch of the early universe, when lepton flavor asymmetry $|l_{\rm e}+l_\mu|$ is large enough to generate a charge chemical potential $|\mu_{\rm Q}|$ larger than vacuum pion mass. By following the same logic, kaon superfluidity might also be possible when $|l_{\rm e}+l_\mu|$ is so large that $|\mu_{\rm Q}|$ becomes larger than vacuum kaon mass. Such a possibility is checked by adopting Ginzburg-Landau approximation within the three-flavor Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model. Consider the case with full chemical balance, though kaon superfluidity could be stable compared to the chiral phases with only $\sigma$ condensations, it would get killed by the more favored homogeneous pion superfluidity. If we introduce mismatch between $s$ and $d$ quarks, kaon superfluidity would require so large $s$ quark density that such a state is impossible in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Exclusive $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ vector meson production using BK evolution theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exclusive diffractive processes, such as exclusive vector meson production, serve as excellent probes of hadron structure within the perturbative regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The exclusive process involving light and heavy vector mesons, $e p \rightarrow e V(V=J/\Psi,\rho,\phi)$, has been investigated at the HERA accelerator facility. In this study, we focus on the theoretical prediction of exclusive $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ vector meson production. Employing the color dipole description of deep inelastic scattering (DIS), we calculate both the differential cross-section and total cross-section of $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ vector mesons, employing an analytical solution of the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. Furthermore, we present the ratio of the longitudinal to the transverse cross-section for $J/\Psi$ and $\rho^0$ as a function of $Q^2$. Two well-known vector meson wave function models, Boosted Gaussian (BG) and Gaus-LC, have been integrated into our analysis, showing slight sensitivity to the chosen vector meson wave functions. Our theoretical predictions agree well with the available experimental data for vector meson production. The analytical solution of the BK equation proves reliable for the theoretical prediction of exclusive vector mesons within a specific range of $Q^2$.</description>

      <title>The origin of the 95 GeV excess in the flavor-dependent U(1)X model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the excesses observed in the CMS diphoton and ditau data around 95 GeV within the framework of the flavor-dependent U(1)X model. The model introduces a singlet scalar to explain the nonzero neutrino masses. This newly introduced Higgs interacts directly with the quark sector, motivated by the aim to explain the flavor numbers of the fermion sector. Additionally, it undergoes mixing with the SM-like Higgs boson. The study suggests that designating this singlet Higgs state in this model as the lightest Higgs boson holds great potential for explaining the excesses around 95 GeV. In the calculations, we maintained the masses of the lightest and next-to-lightest Higgs bosons at around 95 GeV and 125 GeV respectively. It was found that the theoretical predictions on the signal strengthes {\mu}(h95)_{\gamma}{\gamma}, {\mu}(h95)_{\tau}{\tau} in the flavor-dependent U(1)X model can be fitted well to the excesses observed at CMS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically explore their electromagnetic characteristics to improve our understanding of the quark-gluon dynamics underlying the complex and controversial nature of multiquark systems. In this study, the magnetic dipole moments of $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks are extracted, which are directly related to the inner organization of the relevant states. The magnetic dipole moments of these states have been evaluated employing the QCD light-cone sum rules technique with isospin spin-parity $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^-)$, $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$ and $\rm{I(J^P)} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{3}{2}^-)$, for $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks respectively. Our predictions for the magnetic dipole moment $\mu_{D\Sigma_c} = 2.98^{+0.76}_{-0.54}~\mu_N$ for the $ D \Sigma_c$ pentaquark, $\mu_{D\Sigma_c^*} = 1.65^{+0.45}_{-0.34}~\mu_N$ for the $D\Sigma_c^*$ pentaquark, and $\mu_{D^*\Sigma_c} = -3.63^{+0.79}_{-0.60}~\mu_N$ for the $D^*\Sigma_c$ pentaquark. Furthermore, we have also extracted the electric quadrupole and the magnetic octupole moments of the $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks. These values show a non-spherical charge distribution. As a by-product, the magnetic dipole moments of the isospin-$\frac{3}{2}$ partners associated with these doubly-charmed pentaquarks have also been determined. The magnetic dipole moments are calculated as follows: $\mu_{D\Sigma_c} = 3.78^{+0.94}_{-0.70}~\mu_N$, $ \mu_{D\Sigma_c^*} = 2.08^{+0.57}_{-0.43}~\mu_N$, $\mu_{D^*\Sigma_c} = -4.59^{+0.99}_{-0.76}~\mu_N$ for the isospin-$\frac{3}{2}$ partners $ D \Sigma_c$, $ D \Sigma_c^{*}$ and $ D^{*} \Sigma_c$ doubly-charmed pentaquarks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heavy Neutral Leptons with General Couplings at Collider and Fixed Target Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are motivated by attempts to explain neutrino masses and dark matter. If their masses are in the MeV to several GeV range, HNLs are light enough to be copiously produced at collider and accelerator facilities, but also heavy enough to decay to visible particles on length scales that can be observed in particle detectors. Previous studies evaluating the sensitivities of experiments have often focused on simple, but not particularly well-motivated, models in which the HNL mixes with only one active neutrino flavor. In this work, we accurately simulate models for HNL masses between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and arbitrary couplings to $e$, $\mu$, and $\tau$ leptons. We include over 150 HNL production channels and over 100 HNL decay modes, including all of the processes that can be dominant in some region of the general parameter space. The result is HNLCalc, a user-friendly, fast, and flexible library to compute the properties of HNL models. As examples, we implement HNLCalc to extend the FORESEE package to evaluate the prospects for HNL discovery at forward LHC experiments. We present sensitivity reaches for FASER and FASER2 in five benchmark scenarios with coupling ratios $|U_e|^2 : |U_\mu|^2 : |U_{\tau}|^2$ = 1:0:0, 0:1:0, 0:0:1, 0:1:1, and 1:1:1, where the latter two have not been studied previously. Comparing these to current constraints, we identify regions of parameter space with significant discovery prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A five dimensional $SU(6)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification compactified on $S^1/Z_2$ is discussed. We propose new sets of the $SU(6)$ representations where the quarks and leptons in one generation are embedded and there is no extra massless exotic fermions absent in the Standard Model. The correct electroweak symmetry breaking pattern can be realized by introducing some adjoint fermions. We also analyze whether a viable Higgs mass can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Pole trajectories of the $\Lambda(1405)$ helps establish its dynamical nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral trajectories of dynamically generated resonances are connected to the SU(3) breaking pattern and their nature. From an analysis of a recent LQCD simulation on the $\pi\Sigma-\bar{K}N$ scattering for $I=0$, and the study of the quark mass dependence of the octet baryons, we determine for the first time the trajectory of the two poles associated to the $\Lambda(1405)$ towards the symmetric point $(\mathrm{Tr}[M]=\mathrm{cte})$ accurately. Our result at unphysical pion mass is consistent with the lattice simulation at $m_\pi\simeq 200$ MeV and the extrapolation to the physical point, based on the NLO chiral lagrangian, agrees perfectly well with previous analyses of experimental data. Contrary to other works, we predict qualitatively similar trajectories at LO and up to NLO, being consistent with the dominance of the LO interaction. At the SU(3) symmetric point up to NLO, we obtain that the lower pole is located at $E^{(1)}=1595\pm8$ MeV, being a singlet representation, while the higher pole belongs to the octet with a mass $E^{(8)}=1600\pm4$ MeV. This can be tested in the future LQCD simulations.</description>

      <title>The coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems within complex scaling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In present work, we perform a coupled-channel analysis of $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ systems with the one-boson-exchange potentials. We first study the $I(J^{PC})=1(1^{+-})$ $B\bar{B}^{*}/B^{*}\bar{B}^{*}$ system to describe the $Z_{b}(10610)$ and $Z_{b}(10650)$ particles as molecular states and determine the reasonable range of cutoff parameter $\Lambda$. Then, other $B^{(*)}_{(s)}\bar{B}^{(*)}_{(s)}$ combinations with different quantum numbers are systematically investigated. Some bound states and resonances appear in the isoscalar systems, while only several shallow bound states exist for isovector systems. Far away from the excited conventional $P-$wave bottomium, these predicted states can be easily identified as exotic particles both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, the $\eta_b(nS)/\Upsilon(nS)$ plus light mesons are the excellent final states to search for the bound states, while the $B\bar B^*+h.c.$ and $B^* \bar B^*$ channels are suitable for the resonances. We highly recommend that the LHCb and Belle II Collaborations can hunt for these bottomonium-like states in future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the recent MIT lattice QCD data for the pion's gravitational form factors are, in the covered momentum transfer range, fully consistent with the meson dominance principle. In particular, the $2^{++}$ component can be accurately saturated with the $f_2(1270)$ meson, whereas the $0^{++}$ component with the $\sigma$ meson. To incorporate the large width of the $\sigma$, we use the dispersion relation with the spectral density obtained from the analysis of the physical pion scattering data by Donoghue, Gasser, and Leutwyler. We also discuss the implications of the perturbative QCD constraints at high momentum transfers, leading to specific sum rules for the spectral densities of the gravitational form factors, and argue that these densities cannot be of definite sign.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamow-Teller and Fermi matrix elements, ${\left&lt;\mathbf{GT}\right&gt;}$ and ${\left&lt;\mathbf{F}\right&gt;}$, respectively, for tritium $\beta$-decay are calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) in pionless effective field theory in the absence of Coulomb and isospin violation giving the leading order predictions ${\left&lt;\mathbf{GT}\right&gt;}_{0}=0.9807$ and ${\left&lt;\mathbf{F}\right&gt;}_{0}=1$. Using an experimentally determined value for the tritium-$\beta$ decay GT matrix element, the two-body axial current low energy constant is fixed at NLO yielding $L_{1,A}=6.01\pm2.08$ fm$^{3}$ at the renormalization scale of the physical pion mass, which agrees with predictions based on naive dimensional analysis. Finally, the consequences of Wigner-SU(4) spin-isospin symmetry are considered for the Gamow-Teller matrix element.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-GeV neutrinos produced in a stellar core may emerge from main sequence stars, white dwarfs and brown dwarfs producing possible observable signals of dark matter capture. A distribution of these stars near the Milky Way galactic center will produce a neutrino flux that can be probed at Earth based neutrino observatories like Super-Kamiokande. We demonstrate that this can provide a handle to probe dark matter masses in the 100 MeV - 2 GeV mass scales that compares favourably with present day direct detection bounds.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding fermion masses and mixings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model does not constrain the form of the Yukawa matrices and thus the origin of fermion mass hierarchies and mixing pattern remains puzzling. On the other hand, there are intriguing relations between the quark masses and their weak mixing angles, such as the well-known one $\tan \theta_C= \sqrt{m_d/m_s}$ for the Cabibbo angle, which may point towards specific textures of Yukawa matrices hypothesized by Harald Fritzsch at the end of the 70's. Though the original ansatz of Fritzsch is excluded by the experimental data, one can consider its minimal modification which consists in introducing an asymmetry between the 23 and 32 entries in the down-quark Yukawa matrix. We show that this structure is perfectly compatible with the present precision data on quark masses and CKM mixing matrix, and theoretically it can be obtained in the context of $SU(5)$ model with inter-family $SU(3)_H$ symmetry. We also discuss some alternative approaches which could give a natural description of the fermion mass spectrum and weak mixing pattern.</description>

Abstract: According to the Color Glass Condensate approach to relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the earliest phase of the collision is a glasma which is made of highly populated gluon fields that can be treated classically. Using a proper time expansion we study analytically various properties of the glasma. In particular, we compute the glasma energy-momentum tensor which allows us to obtain the energy density, longitudinal and transverse pressure, collective flow, and angular momentum. We also study the role of the glasma in jet quenching by computing collisional energy loss and transverse momentum broadening.</description>

Abstract: Analyzes of astrophysical data provide first hints on the self-interactions of dark matter at low energies. Lattice calculations of dark matter theories can be used to investigate them, especially in the case of strongly-interacting dark matter. We consider Sp(4) gauge theory with two fundamental fermions as a candidate theory. We compute the scattering phase shift for the scattering of two identical dark pions and determine the parameters of the effective range expansion. Our exploratory results in the supposedly most common interaction channel provide a lower limit for the dark matter mass when compared to astrophysical data. We also provide first benchmarks of velocity-weighted cross-sections in the relevant non-relativistic domain.</description>

      <title>Regularized-Renormalized-Resummed loop corrected power spectrum of non-singular bounce with Primordial Black Hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete and consistent exposition of the regularization, renormalization, and resummation procedures in the setup of having a contraction and then non-singular bounce followed by inflation with a sharp transition from slow-roll (SR) to ultra-slow roll (USR) phase for generating primordial black holes (PBHs). We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $\Delta N_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints. We also study the cosmological beta functions across all phases and find their interpretation consistent in the context of bouncing and inflationary scenarios while satisfying the pivot scale normalization requirement. Further, we estimate the spectral distortion effects and shed light on controlling PBH overproduction.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Mimetic Curvaton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mimetic gravity theory is one of the interesting modified gravity theories, which aims to unify the matter component of our universe within the power of gravity. The mimetic-like theory can also be responsible for primordial perturbations production, e.g., when the mimetic field is set to be like a curvaton field, and the adiabatic perturbation can thus be generated from the isocurvature perturbation via usual curvaton mechanism [1]. In the original mimetic curvaton model, the parameter $\lambda$ was purely an algebraic multiplier, lack of any perturbed dynamics. In the current paper, we treat $\lambda$ as an auxiliary field, with its perturbation $\delta\lambda$ evolving alongside. We show that, with such a consideration, the adiabatic perturbation can still be generated from the curvaton mechanism, and becomes scale invariant with different field space configurations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matter and finite nuclei: recent studies based on Parity Doublet Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we summarize recent studies on nuclear matter and finite nuclei based on parity doublet models. We first construct a parity doublet model (PDM), which includes the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ of nucleons together with the mass generated by the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. We then study the density dependence of the symmetry energy in the PDM, which shows that the symmetry energy is larger for smaller chiral invariant mass. Then, we investigate some finite nuclei by applying the Relativistic Continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory to the PDM. We present the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the binding energies and charge radii, and show that $m_0$ = 700 MeV is preferred by the nuclear properties. Finally, we modify the PDM by adding the iso-vector scalar meson $a_0(980)$ and show that the inclusion of the $a_0(980)$ enlarges the symmetry energy of the infinite nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Hubble tension tomography: BAO vs SnIa distance tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the redshift dependence of the Hubble tension by comparing the luminosity distances obtained using an up-to-date BAO dataset (including the latest DESI data) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon+ SnIa distances calibrated with Cepheids. Using a redshift tomography method, we find: 1) The BAO-inferred distances are discrepant with the Pantheon+ SnIa distances across all redshift bins considered, with the discrepancy level varying with redshift. 2) The distance discrepancy is more pronounced at lower redshifts ($z \in [0.1,0.8]$) compared to higher redshifts ($z\in [0.8,2.3]$). The consistency of \lcdm best fit parameters obtained in high and low redshift bins of both BAO and SnIa samples is investigated and we confirm that the tension reduces at high redshifts. Also a mild tension between the redshift bins is identified at higher redshifts for both the BAO and Pantheon+ data with respect to the best fit value of $H_0$ in agreement with previous studies which find hints for an 'evolution' of $H_0$ in the context of $\Lambda$CDM. These results confirm that the low redshift BAO and SnIa distances can only become consistent through a re-evaluation of the distance calibration methods. An $H(z)$ expansion rate deformation alone is insufficient to resolve the tension. Our findings also hint at a possible deviation of the expansion rate from the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model at high redshifts $z\gtrsim 2$. We show that such a deformation is well described by a high redshift transition of $H(z)$ like the one expressed by $\Lambda_s$CDM even though this alone cannot fully resolve the Hubble tension due to its tension with intermediate/low $z$ BAO data.</description>

      <title>Color confinement due to spontaneous breaking of magnetic $U(1)_m^8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity is equal to 8 Abelian monopole currents of the Dirac type satisfying Abelian conservation rules kinematically. There exist magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries in non-Abelian $SU(3)$ QCD. When the magnetic $U(1)_m^8$ symmetries are broken spontaneously, only states which are invariant under all $U(1)_e$ subgroups of $SU(3)$ can exist as a physical state. Such states are $SU(3)$ singlets. The QCD vacuum in the confinement phase is characterized by one long percolating monopole loop running over the whole lattice volume in both quenched and full QCD. The long loop in full QCD is on average a few times longer in comparison with that in quenched QCD case. Surprisingly, the monopole behaviors in full QCD seem independent of the bare quark mass suggesting irrelevance of Abelian monopoles to the chiral symmetry breaking mechanism.
  Existence of such Abelian magnetic monopoles in the continuum limit is studied in detail in $SU(3)$ by means of a block spin transformation of monopoles and the inverse Monte-Carlo method. The monopole density $\rho$ and the infrared effective monopole action $S(k)$ of $n$ blocked monopoles are determined for $a(\beta)=(0.04\sim 2)$fm and $n=1\sim 12$ blockings on $48^4$ lattice in quenched QCD and for $a(\beta)=0.0846(7)$fm and $n=1\sim 24$ on $96^4$ in full QCD at $m_\pi=146$MeV. Originally $\rho$ and $S(k)$ are a two-point function of $a(\beta)$ and the number of times of the blocking transformation $n$. However, both are found to be a function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone in the quenched QCD which suggests the existence of the continuum limit. In the full QCD, the renormalization flow is observed similarly but the scaling is not yet proved. The distributions of the long loops show that monopole condensation occurs due to the entropy dominance over the energy for all $b$ considered.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced a particular nonlinear generalization of quantum mechanics which has the property that it is exactly solvable in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian of the usual linear quantum mechanics problem. In this paper we suggest that the two components of the wave function represent the system described by the Hamiltonian H in two different asymptotic regions of spacetime and we show that the non-linear terms can be viewed as giving rise to gravitational effects.</description>

Abstract: We present the first limit on $g_{A\gamma}$ coupling constant using the Bragg-Primakoff conversion based on an exposure of 1107.5 kg days of data from the CDEX-1B experiment at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory. The data are consistent with the null signal hypothesis, and no excess signals are observed. Limits of the coupling $g_{A\gamma}&lt;2.08\times10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$ (95\% C.L.) are derived for axions with mass up to 100 eV/$c^2$. Within the hadronic model of KSVZ, our results exclude axion mass $&gt;5.3~\rm{eV}/c^2$ at 95\% C.L.</description>

      <title>An IR Fixed Point in QCD with a Dilaton in Nuclear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possible consequence of an IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f=2, 3$ in nuclear matter is discussed. It is shown in terms of d(ilaton)-$\chi$ effective field theory (d$\chi$EFT) incorporated in a generalized effective field theory (G$n$EFT) implemented with hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry that the recently measured superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly-magic-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn indicates a surprisingly large anomaly-induced quenching (AIQ) of $g_A$ from the free-space value of 1.276 to $\approx 0.8 $. Combined with the quenching expected from strong nuclear correlations, the effective coupling in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}$ would come to $\sim 0.6$. If this result were reconfirmed, it would impact not only nuclear structure and dense compact-star matter -- where $g_A$ figures in $\pi$-N coupling via the Goldberger-Treiman relation -- but also in search for physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), e.g. $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay, where 4th power of $g_A$ figures.</description>

      <title>High-energy neutrinos from late-time jets of gamma-ray bursts with cocoon photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), $\sim$ 100 - 1000 s after the prompt emission, afterglow observations have consistently shown X-ray excesses detected in the form of flares (XFs; in long GRBs) or extended emission (EEs; in short GRBs). These observations are interpreted as emissions from jets launched by late central engine activity. However, the characteristics of these late-time jets, particularly the dissipation radius ($r_{\rm diss}$), Lorentz factor ($\Gamma$), and cosmic-ray loading factor ($\xi_p$), remain unknown despite their importance. Here, in order to understand the properties of the late-time jets with future multi-messenger observations, we estimate the detectability of neutrinos associated with late-time emissions for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$, assuming $\xi_p=10$. We take into account external seed photons from the cocoon around the jets, which can enhance the neutrino production through photohadronic interaction in the jet dissipation region. Our results are still consistent with the upper limit obtained by IceCube. Our calculations indicate a promising prospect for neutrino detection with IceCube-Gen2 through the stacking of $\sim 1000-2000$ events, for a wide range of $r_{\rm diss}$ and $\Gamma$. We found that setting an optimal energy threshold of 10 TeV can significantly reduce noise without negatively affecting neutrino detection. Furthermore, even in the case of non-detection, we show that meaningful constraints on the characteristics of the late-time jets can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Valence Quark PDFs of the Proton from Two-Current Correlations in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following previous works on that topic, we consider Euclidean hadronic matrix elements in position space of two spatially separated local currents on the lattice, in order to extract the $x$-dependence of parton distribution functions (PDFs). The corresponding approach is often referred to by the term lattice cross section (LCS). In this work we will consider valence quark PDFs of an unpolarized proton. We adapt the previously established formalism to our choice of operators. The calculation of the two-current matrix elements requires the evaluation of four-point functions. The corresponding calculation is carried out on a $n_f = 2+1$ gauge ensemble with lattice spacing $a = 0.0856~\mathrm{fm}$ and pseudoscalar masses $m_\pi = 355~\mathrm{MeV}$, $m_K = 441~\mathrm{MeV}$. The four-point functions have been evaluated in a previous project. The lattice data is converted to the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-scheme at a scale $\mu=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and improved w.r.t. lattice artifacts. We use a common model as fit ansatz for the lattice data in order to extract the PDFs.</description>

      <title>Long term variability of Cygnus X-1. VIII. A spectral-timing look at low energies with NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) monitoring campaign of Cyg X-1 allows us to study its spectral-timing behavior at energies ${&lt;}1$ keV across all states. The hard state power spectrum can be decomposed into two main broad Lorentzians with a transition at around 1 Hz. The lower-frequency Lorentzian is the dominant component at low energies. The higher-frequency Lorentzian begins to contribute significantly to the variability above 1.5 keV and dominates at high energies. We show that the low- and high-frequency Lorentzians likely represent individual physical processes. The lower-frequency Lorentzian can be associated with a (possibly Comptonized) disk component, while the higher-frequency Lorentzian is clearly associated with the Comptonizing plasma. At the transition of these components, we discover a low-energy timing phenomenon characterized by an abrupt lag change of hard (${\gtrsim}2$ keV) with respect to soft (${\lesssim}1.5$ keV) photons, accompanied by a drop in coherence, and a reduction in amplitude of the second broad Lorentzian. The frequency of the phenomenon increases with the frequencies of the Lorentzians as the source softens and cannot be seen when the power spectrum is single-humped. A comparison to transient low-mass X-ray binaries shows that this feature does not only appear in Cyg X-1, but that it is a general property of accreting black hole binaries. In Cyg X-1, we find that the variability at low and high energies is overall highly coherent in the hard and intermediate states. The high coherence shows that there is a process at work which links the variability, suggesting a physical connection between the accretion disk and Comptonizing plasma. This process fundamentally changes in the soft state, where strong red noise at high energies is incoherent to the variability at low energies.</description>

      <title>Infrared gluon propagator in the Refined Gribov-Zwanziger scenario at one-loop order in the Landau gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Refined Gribov-Zwanziger (RGZ) action in the Landau gauge provides a local and renormalizable framework to account for the existence of infinitesimal Gribov copies in the path integral together with other relevant infrared effects such as the formation of condensates. The properties of the tree-level gluon propagator obtained in this setup has been thoroughly investigated over the past decade. It accommodates important properties seen in lattice simulations such as a finite value at vanishing momentum and positivity violation. Yet a comprehensive study about the stability of such properties against quantum corrections was lacking. In this work, we compute the gluon propagator in the RGZ scenario at one-loop order and implement an appropriate renormalization scheme in order to compare our findings with lattice data. Remarkably, the qualitative properties of the tree-level gluon propagator are preserved. In particular, the fits with lattice data show evidence for positivity violation and the existence of complex poles for SU(2) and SU(3) gauge groups. We comment on the results for the ghost propagator as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The substructure of atomic nuclei resulting from the clustering of nucleons is crucial for understanding nuclear structure and dynamics. Various cluster configurations can emerge depending on excitation energy, the number and types of core clusters, and the presence of excess neutrons. Despite the prevalence of tightly bound cluster formations in low-lying states, understanding the correlation between clusters and their formation mechanisms remains incomplete. This exploring study investigates nuclear clustering at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) using simulations based on the modified BeAGLE model. By simulating collisions involving $e$+$^{9}$Be, $e$+$^{12}$C, and $e$+$^{16}$O nuclei, we find that the average energy of particles $\langle E \rangle$ and the system size ratios of particles at forward rapidity exhibit sensitivity to alpha clustering and its various configurations. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of nuclear clustering and its implications for future studies at the EIC.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition of Anisotropic Hot Dense QGP in Magnetic Field: $z^5$-term Holography for Heavy Quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a five-dimensional twice anisotropic holographic model for heavy quarks supported by Einstein-dilaton-three-Maxwell action. A special feature of the model is the presence of $z^5$-term in the metric strain coefficient (warp factor). It's influence on the model properties, mainly on the confinement/deconfinement phase transition, is considered. Conditions for the direct magnetic catalysis are found and the corresponding phase diagrams are discussed.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Color Correlations in Double Parton Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contribution of color correlations to Double Parton Scattering (DPS). We show that there is a specific class of Feynman diagrams related to so called 1 \textrightarrow{} 2 processes when the contribution of these color correlations is not Sudakov suppressed with the transverse scales. The split scale increases with the transverse scale Q, with color correlations being up to 5-10 percent of singlet ones. The effective absence of Sudakov suppression gives hope that although they are small relative to color singlet correlations, they eventually can be observed.</description>

      <title>Effective oscillatory magnetic charges and electric dipole moments induced by axion-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the covariance of Lagrangians always taking place results in a distortion of any electric and magnetic fields by a pseudoscalar field of axions and axion-like particles. As a result, electric and magnetic fields acquire oscillating magnetic and electric components, respectively. One can also use the equivalent approach based on an introduction of effective oscillating magnetic charges and electric dipole moments in undistorted electromagnetic fields. The determined relations between the magnetic charges and electric dipole moments and the axion-photon coupling constant open a possibility to compare a sensitivity of search for axions in optical experiments and experiments with massive particles. The inverse (dual) Witten effect defining effective magnetic charges of electrically charged particles opens new exciting possibilities to search for axions and axion-like particles with very small masses in nonresonance experiments. The study of a passage of strongly decelerated electrons or positrons through a solenoid is proposed.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave effects and phenomenology of a two-component dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an extension of the Standard Model (SM) which could have two candidates for dark matter (DM) including a Dirac fermion and a vector dark matter (VDM) under a new $U(1)$ gauge group in the hidden sector. The model is classically scale-invariant and the electroweak symmetry breaks because of loop effects. We investigate the parameter space allowed by current experimental constraints and phenomenological bounds. We probe the parameter space of the model in the mass range $1&lt; M_V&lt;5000$ GeV and $1&lt;M_{\psi}&lt;5000$ GeV. It has been shown that there are many points in this mass range that are in agreement with all phenomenological constraints. The electroweak phase transition has been discussed and it has been shown that there is region in the parameter space of the model consistent with DM relic density and direct detection constraints that, at the same time, can lead to first order electroweak phase transition. The gravitational waves produced during the phase transition could be probed by future space-based interferometers such as LISA and BBO.</description>

      <title>Long Lived Particle Decays in MATHUSLA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carefully study the decay and reconstruction of long-lived particle (LLP) decays in the proposed MATHUSLA LLP detector for the HL-LHC. Our investigations are focused on three LLP benchmark models. MATHUSLA's primary physics target is represented by hadronically decaying LLPs with mass above $\sim$ $10~\mathrm{GeV}$, produced in exotic Higgs decays. We also investigate GeV-scale scalar and right-handed-neutrino LLPs, which are the target of many other proposed experiments. We first introduce a public MATHUSLA FastSim code to allow for efficient signal-only studies of LLP decays in MATHUSLA and general external LLP detectors. For each of our benchmark scenarios, we carefully simulate LLP production and decay, and make our simulation library publicly accessible for future investigations and comparisons with other experiments. We then systematically study the geometric acceptance of MATHUSLA for LLP decays in these scenarios, and present updated sensitivity projections that include these acceptances. Our results show that the idealized reach of MATHUSLA computed in earlier studies is mostly realized. We also investigate possible ways of increasing the signal acceptance using the inherent geometric flexibility of the FastSim, which will provide useful inputs for realistic experimental and engineering optimization of the detector in the future.</description>

      <title>Ripples of the QCD Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a critical end point (CEP) on the experimentally accessible baryon number fluctuations of different orders. By now, its potential location has been constrained fairly accurately within first principles functional QCD, together with the location of the chiral crossover line and further thermodynamic observables. This information is incorporated in an advanced QCD-assisted low energy effective theory which is used for the computation of baryon number fluctuations at the chemical freeze-out. This computation also takes care of global baryon number conservation at larger density, where the system changes from grand-canonical to canonical statistics. We observe a prominent peak structure, whose amplitude depends on the location of the CEP, while its position is more sensitive to the location of the freeze-out curve. Our results provide guidance for future low energy heavy-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Comparison between $\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}$ colliders for charged Higgs production in 2HDM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of the charged Higgs boson at future muon colliders. We investigate both the pair production $\mu^+ \mu^- \to H^+ H^-$, the single production $\mu^+ \mu^- \to W^\pm H^\mp$, as well as the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) $\{e^+e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-\} \to \nu \bar{\nu} H^+ H^-$. We show that the neutral Higgs exchange diagrams in the muon collider case can lead to a significant boost in the cross sections through their Yukawa couplings. Our results for the muon collider are systematically compared to the corresponding ones at $e^+e^-$ machines. It is demonstrated that the vector boson fusion (VBF) $e^+e^- \to \nu \bar{\nu} H^+ H^-$ can compete with the mentioned $2\to 2$ processes. We select benchmark points and perform signal-background analyses, taking into account detector simulations. We demonstrate the discovery region at $5\sigma$ and the excluded region at $2\sigma$ levels at a 3 TeV muon collider.</description>

      <title>$B_c$ to $A$ Transition Form Factors and Semileptonic Decays in Self-consistent Covariant Light-front Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the semileptonic weak decays of $B_c$ meson decaying to axial-vector ($A$) mesons for bottom-conserving and bottom-changing decay modes. We employ self-consistent covariant light-front quark model (CLFQM) that uses type-II correspondence to eliminate inconsistencies in the traditional type-I CLFQM. As a fresh attempt, we test the self-consistency in CLFQM through type-II correspondence for $B_c \to A$ meson transition form factors. We establish that in type-II correspondence the form factors for longitudinal and transverse polarization states are numerically equal and are free from zero-mode contributions, which confirms the self-consistency of type-II correspondence for $B_c \to A$ transition form factors. Furthermore, we ascertain that the problems of inconsistency and violation of covariance of CLFQM within the type-I correspondence are resolved in type-II correspondence for $B_c \to A$ transitions. We thoroughly investigate the effects of self-consistency between type-I and type-II schemes using a comparative analysis. We also study the $q^2$ dependence of the form factors in weak hadronic currents for the whole accessible kinematic range $0 \leqslant q^2 \leqslant q^2_{max}$ for both bottom-conserving as well as bottom-changing transitions. In addition, we extend our analysis to predict the branching ratios of the semileptonic weak decays of $B_c$ meson involving axial-vector meson in the final state to quantify the effects of self-consistency in these decays that were not studied before. We evaluate the lepton mass effect on these branching ratios and various other important physical observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameter, asymmetry parameter, and longitudinal polarization asymmetries and fractions. Finally, we obtain the lepton flavor universality ratios for various decays.</description>

      <title>Search For a Leptoquark and Vector-like Lepton in a Muon Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposal for a high-energy muon collider offers many opportunities in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). The collider by construction is likely to be more sensitive to the muon-philic models, primarily motivated by the BSM explanation of muon $(g-2)$ excess and quark flavor anomalies. In this work, we explore the potential of the proposed muon collider in the context of such models and focus on one such model that extends the Standard Model (SM) with a leptoquark, a vector-like lepton, and a real scalar. In this model, we propose searches for TeV scale leptoquarks in $2\mu+2b+mET$ channel. Notably, the leptoquark can be produced singly at the muon collider with a large cross-section. We have shown that a significant signal in this channel can be detected at a 3~TeV muon collider even with an integrated luminosity as low as $\sim 10$~fb$^{-1}$</description>

      <title>Tri-unification: a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss $SU(5)^{3}$ with cyclic symmetry as a possible grand unified theory (GUT). The basic idea of such a tri-unification is that there is a separate $SU(5)$ for each fermion family, with the light Higgs doublet(s) arising from the third family $SU(5)$, providing a basis for charged fermion mass hierarchies. $SU(5)^{3}$ tri-unification reconciles the idea of gauge non-universality with the idea of gauge coupling unification, opening the possibility to build consistent non-universal descriptions of Nature that are valid all the way up to the scale of grand unification. As a concrete example, we propose a grand unified embedding of the tri-hypercharge model $U(1)_Y^3$ based on an $SU(5)^{3}$ framework with cyclic symmetry. We discuss a minimal tri-hypercharge example which can account for all the quark and lepton (including neutrino) masses and mixing parameters. We show that it is possible to unify the many gauge couplings into a single gauge coupling associated with the cyclic $SU(5)^{3}$ gauge group, by assuming minimal multiplet splitting, together with a set of relatively light colour octet scalars. We also study proton decay in this example, and present the predictions for the proton lifetime in the dominant $e^+\pi^0$ channel.</description>

Abstract: The rapid deployment of computing hardware different from the traditional CPU+RAM model in data centers around the world mandates a change in the design of event generators for the Large Hadron Collider, in order to provide economically and ecologically sustainable simulations for the high-luminosity era of the LHC. Parton-level event generation is one of the most computationally demanding parts of the simulation and is therefore a prime target for improvements. We present a production-ready leading-order parton-level event generation framework capable of utilizing most modern hardware and discuss its performance in the standard candle processes of vector boson and top-quark pair production with up to five additional jets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strongly coupled system like the quark-hadron transition (if it is of first order) is becoming an active play yard for the physics of cosmological first-order phase transitions. However, the traditional field theoretic approach to strongly coupled first-order phase transitions is of great challenge, driving recent efforts from holographic dual theories with explicit numerical simulations. These holographic numerical simulations have revealed an intriguing linear correlation between the phase pressure difference (pressure difference away from the wall) to the nonrelativistic terminal velocity of an expanding planar wall, which has been reproduced analytically alongside both cylindrical and spherical walls from perfect-fluid hydrodynamics in our previous study but only for a bag equation of state. We also found, in our previous study, a universal quadratic correlation between the wall pressure difference (pressure difference near the bubble wall) to the nonrelativistic terminal wall velocity regardless of wall geometries. In this paper, we will generalize these analytic relations between the phase/wall pressure difference and terminal wall velocity into a more realistic equation of state beyond the simple bag model, providing the most general predictions so far for future tests from holographic numerical simulations of strongly coupled first-order phase transitions</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of breaking discrete global symmetries in quantum gravity (QG). We extend a previous scenario where discrete global symmetries are responsible for scalar dark matter (DM) and domain walls (DWs), to the case of fermionic DM, considered as a feebly interacting massive particle, which achieves the correct DM relic density via the freeze-in mechanism. Due to the mixing between DM and the standard model neutrinos, various indirect DM detection methods can be employed to constrain the QG scale, the scale of freeze-in, and the reheating temperature simultaneously. Since such QG symmetry breaking leads to DW annihilation, this may generate the characteristic gravitational wave background, and hence explain the recent observations of the gravitational wave spectrum by pulsar timing arrays. This work therefore highlights a tantalizing possibility of probing the effective scale of QG from observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects on sub-TeV resonant leptogenesis of Primordial Black Holes with masses from $10^6$ to $\sim 10^9$ g. The latter might dominate the energy content of the Universe altering its evolution and, eventually, diluting the final baryon asymmetry. We find that, depending on the mass and abundance of Primordial Black Holes, the parameter space of sub-TeV resonant leptogenesis shrinks towards higher Right-Handed Neutrino masses and smaller active-sterile mixing. Remarkably, this translates into important implications for the experimental searches of heavy neutral leptons. Conversely, we demonstrate that a possible future detection of sub-TeV heavy neutral leptons would disfavour regions of the parameter space of Primordial Black Holes currently allowed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of a background magnetic field when applied to a nonextensive QCD medium in a $2+1$ flavour Nambu\textemdash Jona-Lasinio model. The effect of a constant as well as an $eB$-dependent coupling is considered. For the constant coupling, the well-known magnetic catalysis effect is observed with reduced strength in both the condensates and the transition temperatures compared to the standard extensive medium. In the case of a field-dependent coupling, we observe a competition between the nonextensive parameter, $q$ and $eB$. With sufficiently high $q$-values, the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis \textemdash\, a well-known trait in effective models featuring $eB$-dependent coupling, appears to be eliminated within the range of magnetic fields examined in our present study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an effective theory for an ensemble of center vortices, we observe the area law fall-off in the continuum limit for the SU($2$) gauge group in three-dimensional Euclidean space-time. The string tension is obtained in terms of the intrinsic properties of the vortices and the parameter describing their interactions. A good qualitative agreement between our results and the lattice ones is observed. In addition, we show that the repulsive force between the vortices increases with temperature. This behavior is expected due to the reduction of vortex configuration at higher temperatures, required for the deconfinement regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Top pair production is ideally suited to observe post-decay entanglement, thus providing a novel test of quantum mechanics. We provide top polarised decay amplitudes that can be used to compute semi-analytical predictions and, in particular, to better understand {\em why} the post-decay entanglement arises. We obtain predictions for the LHC, identifying general phase space regions where experimental measurements of $tW$ entanglement are feasible. We also give predictions for polarised $e^+ e^-$ collisions, focusing on the possibility that the post-decay $tW$ entanglement is larger than the $t \bar t$ one.</description>

      <title>Squark production with R-symmetry beyond NLO at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minimal R-symmetric Supersymmetric Standard Model (MRSSM) provides a realisation of supersymmetry in which the parameter space is less constrained by the current LHC data than in the simplest supersymmetric scenarios. In the present paper, we obtain the most precise theoretical predictions in the MRSSM for squark production at the LHC, enabling accurate interpretations of LHC data in terms of the MRSSM. We perform threshold resummation of soft gluon corrections to the total cross sections for the production of squark-(anti)squark pairs at the LHC in the MRSSM framework. The resummation is carried out using the direct QCD method and reaches the next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, which requires calculating the one-loop matching coefficients in the relevant production channels. The resummed cross sections are then matched to the available NLO results and evaluated for $\sqrt{S}=13.6$ TeV. Compared with the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the cross sections in the MRSSM can be significantly reduced, implying less stringent limits on squark and gluino masses. Our results carry significant implications for exploring the viability of supersymmetry at the LHC. The results of our calculation are publicly available as a numerical package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the triply heavy spin-1/2 baryons with quark contents $ ccb $ and $ bbc $, and calculate their mass and residue using QCD sum rules. In the calculations, we consider the ground (1S), first orbitally excited (1P) and first radially excited (2S) states. Aiming to achieve higher accuracies in the results, we perform the computations by taking into account the non-perturbative operators up to eight mass dimensions. We compare our results with the predictions of other theoretical studies existing in the literature. The obtained results may help experimental groups in their search for these yet unseen, but previously predicted by the quark model, interesting particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we have studied the realizations of the popular TM1 neutrino mixing and neutrino $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry (which are well motivated from the neutrino oscillation data and lead to interesting phenomenological consequences) in the most minimal seesaw model with a pseudo-Dirac pair of right-handed neutrinos, and their consequences for leptogenesis. In order to realize the low-scale resonant leptogenesis scenario, we have considered two possible ways of generating the tiny mass splitting between the two right-handed neutrinos: one way is to modify their Majorana mass matrix to a form as shown in Eq. (25); the other way is to consider the renormalization-group corrections for their masses. For the $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry, in order for leptogenesis to work, we have further considered the flavor-dependent conversion efficiencies from the lepton asymmetry to the baryon asymmetry during the sphaleron processes, and its breaking via the renormalization-group corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a possibility whether a model of grand gauge-Higgs unification incorporating family unification in higher dimensions can be constructed. We first extend a five dimensional $SU(6)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification model to a five dimensional $SU(7)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification model compactified on an orbifold $S^1/Z_2$ to obtain three generations of quarks and leptons after symmetrybreaking of the larger family unified gauge group. A prescription of constructing a six dimensional $SU(N)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification model including a five dimensional $SU(7)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification after compactifying the sixth dimension on an orbifold $S^1/Z_2$ is given. We find a six dimensional $SU(14)$ grand gauge-Higgs unification model with a set of representations containing three generations of quarks and leptons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ first-principles quantum field theoretical methods to investigate the longitudinal and transverse electrical conductivities of a strongly magnetized hot QED plasma at the leading order in coupling. The analysis utilized the fermion damping rate in the Landau-level representation obtained recently. In the relativistic regime, both conductivities exhibit an approximate scaling behavior given by $\sigma_{\parallel,\perp} = T \tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$, where $\tilde{\sigma}_{\parallel,\perp}$ are functions of the dimensionless ratio $|eB|/T^2$ (here $T$ denotes the temperature and $B$ the magnetic field). We argue that the mechanisms for the transverse and longitudinal conductivities differ significantly, leading to a strong suppression of the former in comparison to the latter. Additionally, we extend our analysis to a magnetized quark-gluon plasma, although the approximation's validity breaks down in QCD at strong coupling.</description>

      <title>Branching ratios and CP asymmetries of the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \rightarrow \ K^{*}_0(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \rightarrow K \pi D_{(s)} $ in the PQCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430,1950) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ within the perterbative QCD (PQCD) framework. The S-wave two-meson distribution amplitudes (DAs) are introduced to describe the final state interactions of the $K\pi$ pair, which involve the time-like form factors and the Gegenbauer polynomials. In the calculations, we adopt two kinds of parameterization schemes to describe the time-like form factors: One is the relativistic Breit-Wigner (RBW) formula, which is usually more siutable for the narrow resonances, and the other is the LASS line shape proposed by the LASS Collaboration, which includes both the resonant and nonresonant components. We find that the branching ratios and the direct CP violations for the decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)}$ obtained from those of the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ under the narrow width approximation (NWA) can be consistent well with the previous PQCD results calculated in the two-body framework by assuming that $K^*_0(1430)$ being the lowest lying $\bar q s$ state, which is so-called scenario II (SII). We conclude that the LASS parameterization is more siutable to describe the $K_0^{*}(1430)$ than the RBW formula, and the nonresonant components play an important role in the branching ratios of the decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1430) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$. In view of the large difference between the decay width measurements for the $K_0^{*}(1950)$ given by BaBar and LASS collaborations, we calculate the branching ratios and the CP violations for the quasi-two-body decays $B_c \to K_0^{*}(1950) D_{(s)} \to K \pi D_{(s)}$ by using two values, $\Gamma_{K^*_0(1950)}=0.100\pm0.04$ GeV and $\Gamma_{K^*_0(1950)}=0.201\pm0.034$ GeV, besides the two kinds of parameterizations for the resonance $K^*_0(1950)$.</description>

Abstract: For understanding the hierarchies of fermion masses and mixing, we extend the standard model gauge group with $U(1)_X$ and $Z_2$ symmetry. The field content of the Standard model is augmented by three heavy right-handed neutrinos and two new scalar singlets. $U(1)_X$ charges of different fields are considered after satisfying anomaly cancellation conditions. In this scenario, the fermion masses are generated through higher dimensional effective operators. The small neutrino masses are obtained through type-1 seesaw mechanism using the heavy right handed neutrino fields. We discuss the flavor-changing neutral current processes which is originated due to the sequential nature of $U(1)_X$ symmetry. We have written effective higher dimensional operators in terms of renormalizable dimension four operators by introducing vector like fermions.</description>

Abstract: The Rivet toolkit is the primary mechanism for phenomenological preservation of collider-physics measurements, containing both a computational core and API for analysis implementation, and a large collection of more than a thousand preserved analyses. In this note we summarise the main changes in the new Rivet 4 major release series. These include a major generalisation and more semantically coherent model for histograms and related data objects, a thorough clean-up of inelegant and legacy observable-computation tools, and new systems for extended analysis-data, incorporation of preserved machine-learning models, and serialization for high-performance computing applications. Where these changes introduce backward-incompatible interface changes, existing analyses have been updated and indications are given on how to update new analysis routines and workflows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a new type of dynamical dark matter mechanism, we discuss the stability of the gauged Q-ball dark matter and its production mechanism through a cosmological first-order phase transition. This work delves into the study of gauged Q-ball dark matter generated during the cosmic phase transition. We demonstrate detailed discussions on the stability of gauged Q-balls to rigorously constrain their charge and mass ranges. Additionally, employing analytic approximations and the mapping method, we provide qualitative insights of gauged Q-balls. We establish an upper limit on the gauge coupling constant and give the relic density of stable gauged Q-ball dark matter formed during a first-order phase transition. Furthermore, we discuss potential observational signatures or constraints of gauged Q-ball dark matter, including astronomical observations and gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new exclusion bounds obtained at the European X-ray Free Electron Laser facility (EuXFEL) on axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range 10^{-3} eV \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{4} eV, which is relatively unconstrained by laboratory searches. Our experiment exploits the Primakoff effect via which photons can, in the presence of a strong external electric field, decay into axions, which then convert back into photons after passing through an opaque wall. While similar searches have been performed previously at a 3$^{\rm rd}$ generation synchrotron (Yamaji et al. 2018) our work demonstrates improved sensitivity, exploiting the higher brightness of X-rays at EuXFEL.</description>

      <title>Exploring solutions to the muon g-2 anomaly in a THDM-like model under flavor constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic moment of the muon can receive significant two-loop contributions from the scalar spectrum in Two Higgs Doublet Models (THDM), particularly for a light pseudoscalar. It is established that the symmetry breaking from $SU(3)_L \times U(1)_N$ to $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ generates an effective Type-III THDM, which invariably leads to flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes. In this study, we examine whether such an effective THDM framework can account for the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, considering the constraints imposed by $B$-meson decays, meson mixing, and invisible Higgs decays. Our principal finding reveals that a pseudoscalar with a mass of 66 GeV and a $\tan \beta$ value of 58 can account for the $g-2$ anomaly without conflicting with existing experimental limits.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations indicate a $4.9\sigma$ tension between the CMB and quasar dipoles. This tension challenges the cosmological principle. We propose that if we live in a gigaparsec scale void, the CMB and quasar dipolar tension can be reconciled. This is because we are unlikely to live at the center of the void. And a 19% offset from the center will impact the quasars and CMB differently in their dipolar anisotropies. As we consider a large and thick void, our setup can also ease the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article aims at clarifying the situation about astrophysical sources that might be observed with haloscope experiments sensitive to gravitational waves in the 1-10 GHz band. The GrAHal setup is taken as a benchmark. We follow a very pedagogical path so that the full analysis can easily be used by the entire community who might not be familiar with the theoretical framework. Different relevant physical regimes are considered in details and some formulas encountered in the literature are revised. In particular, we carefully take into account the fast drift of the gravitational wave frequency and the relevant experimental timescales. We also relax the usual assumption that only the merging phase should be considered. The distances that can be probed and expected event rates are carefully evaluated, taking into account degeneracies between physical parameters. We show where experimental efforts should be focused to improve the sensitivity and we conclude that any detection in the near future is extremely unlikely.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the isospin equilibration properties of neutrinoless nuclear ($npe$) matter in the temperature and density range that is relevant to neutron star mergers. Our analysis incorporates neutrino-transparency corrections to the isospin (``beta'') equilibrium condition which become noticeable at $T\gtrsim 1\,$MeV. We find that the isospin relaxation rate rises rapidly as temperature rises, and at $T\approx 5\,$MeV it is comparable to the timescale of the density oscillations that occur immediately after the merger. This produces a resonant peak in the bulk viscosity at $T\approx 5\,$MeV, which causes density oscillations to be damped on the timescale of the merger. Our calculations suggest that isospin relaxation dynamics may also be relevant when neutrinos are treated more accurately via neutrino transport schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the excitation of a one-electron quantum cyclotron by gravitational waves. The electron in such as a penning trap is prepared to be at the lowest Landau level, which has an infinite degeneracy parameterized by the size of the wave function. We find that the excitation rate from the ground state to the first excited state is enhanced by the size of the electron wave function: an electron with a larger wave function feels gravitational waves more. As a consequence, we derive a good sensitivity to gravitational waves at a macroscopic one-electron quantum cyclotron.</description>

Abstract: A Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow object can be formed when a neutron star is absorbed by the envelope of its giant companion star, spirals toward the center of the giant star due to the drag from the surrounding envelope, and merges with the star's core. During in-spiral, dynamical friction is the main drag force acting on a neutron star inside the star envelope. However, dynamical friction is caused by the neutron star's gravitational interaction with its own gravitationally induced wake. Therefore, exactly the same gravitational drag force will act on a mirror neutron star, and if a significant part of the dark matter is in the form of mirror matter, then we expect the formation of Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects with a mirror neutron star inside. We explore the plausibility of the existence of such exotic Thorne-\.{Z}ytkow objects.</description>

      <title>Cool dark sector, concordance, and a low $\sigma_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological model in which a fraction of the dark matter is atomic dark matter (ADM). This ADM consists of dark versions of the electron and of the proton, interacting with each other and with dark photons just as their light sector versions do, but interacting with everything else only gravitationally. We find constraints given current cosmic microwave background (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, with and without an $H_0$ prior, and with and without enforcing a big bang nucleosynthesis consistent helium abundance. We find that, at low dark photon temperature, one can have consistency with BAO and CMB data, with a fraction of dark matter that is ADM ($f_{\rm adm}$) as large as $\sim 0.1$. Such a large $f_{\rm adm}$ leads to a suppression of density fluctuations today on scales below about 60 Mpc that may be of relevance to the $\sigma_8$ tension. Our work motivates calculation of nonlinear corrections to matter power spectrum predictions in the ADM model. We forecast parameter constraints to come from future ground-based CMB surveys, and find that if ADM is indeed the cause of the $\sigma_8$ tension, the influence of the ADM, primarily on CMB lensing, will likely be detectable at high significance.</description>

      <title>Phi4tools: Compilation of Feynman diagrams for Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar field theories with quartic interactions are of central interest in the study of second-order phase transitions. For three-dimensional theories, numerous studies make use of the fixed-dimensional perturbative computation of [B. Nickel, D. Meiron, and G. Baker Jr, Compilation of 2-pt and 4-pt graphs for continuous spin model, University of Guelph report (1977)], unfortunately left unpublished. We independently verify the results of Nickel et al., and we extend the computation to the eighth order in the coupling constant. The results of our calculations, together with the tools developed, are made available in Phi4tools, a user-friendly package that allows displaying the information about the individual Feynman diagrams, including the numerical values for the diagrams for zero, two, and four-point functions. We also provide the perturbative series up to order eight for the renormalization-group functions for the $O(N)$ and cubic anisotropic models.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>QCD Equation of State at nonzero baryon density in external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of QCD equation of state in external magnetic field and nonzero baryon density. Our study is carried out by means of lattice simulation with 2+1 dynamical staggered quarks at the physical masses. The simulation is conducted at imaginary baryon chemical potential what allowed us to overcome the sign problem. We expand the pressure in the baryon imaginary chemical potential and study three leading nonzero coefficients in this expansion. These coefficients were calculated for the following values of magnetic field: $eB=0.3$, $0.6$, $1.2$ GeV$^2$ with the lattice sizes $8\times32^3$, $10\times40^3$, $12\times48^3$. Using these data we take continuum limit for the coefficients. Our results indicate considerable enhancement of the expansion coefficients by the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false vacuum islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <title>The evolution equation for the energy-momentum moments of the non-equilibrium density function &amp; The regularized relativistic third order hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08204v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we first derive the evolution equation for the general energy-momentum moment of $\delta f$, where $\delta f$ is the deviation from the local equilibrium phase space density. We then introduce a relativistic extension of regularized hydrodynamics developed in the non-relativistic case by Struchtrup and Torrilhon that combines the method of moments and Chapman-Enskog expansion. Hydrodynamic equations up to the third-order in gradients are then systematially derived within the context of a single species system and the relaxation time approximation. This is followed by a series of linear stability and causality analysis. For the system of massless particles without any charge conservation, the third-order hydrodynamics is shown to be linearly stable and causal.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$ polarization in very high energy heavy ion collisions as a probe of the Quark-Gluon Plasma formation and properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions at center-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV carried out at RHIC and LHC colliders. We have calculated the mean spin vector at local thermodynamic equilibrium, including all known first-order terms in the gradients of the thermo-hydrodynamic fields, assuming that the hadronization hypersurface has a uniform temperature. We have also included the feed-down contributions to the polarization of $\Lambda$ stemming from the decays of polarized $\Sigma^*$ and $\Sigma^0$ hyperons. The obtained results are in good agreement with the data. In general, the component of the spin vector along the global angular momentum, orthogonal to the reaction plane, shows strong sensitivity to the initial longitudinal flow velocity. Furthermore, the longitudinal component of the spin vector turns out to be very sensitive to the bulk viscosity of the plasma at the highest LHC energy. Therefore, the azimuthal dependence of spin polarization can effectively constrain the initial hydrodynamic conditions and the transport coefficients of the Quark Gluon Plasma.</description>

      <title>An emergent cosmological model from running Newton constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an emergent cosmological model rooted in the Asymptotically Safe antiscreening behavior of the Newton constant at Planckian energies. Distinguishing itself from prior approaches, our model encapsulates the variable nature of $G$ through a multiplicative coupling within the matter Lagrangian, characterized by a conserved energy-momentum tensor. The universe emerges from a quasi-de Sitter phase, transitioning to standard cosmological evolution post-Planck Era. Our analysis demonstrates the feasibility of constraining the transition scale to nearly classical cosmology using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and the potential to empirically probe the antiscreening trait of Newton's constant, as predicted by Asymptotic Safety.</description>
