      <title>Task-Oriented Direct-to-Cell Satellite Communications for Closed-Loop Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct-to-cell (D2C) satellite communications have emerged as a crucial alternative and complement to terrestrial communication networks for autonomous operations due to their wide-area coverage capability. Unlike human-oriented communications, robot-oriented D2C communications in autonomous operations place greater emphasis on task completion rather than solely on data transmission. Such differences require us to evaluate the performance of each stage in the system and consider the integrated optimization. Motivated by this, we model the system in a sensing-communication-computing-control (SC3) closed-loop manner and analyze it from an entropy-based perspective, based on which a task-oriented system design method is developed. Furthermore, to manage the complexity of the closed-loop system, we decompose it into fine-grained functional structures and investigate the key challenges associated with collaborative sensing, collaborative computing, and collaborative control. A case study is presented to compare the proposed task-oriented scheme with conventional communication-oriented schemes, showing that the proposed method performs better in terms of task controlling. Finally, we discuss several open research challenges that need to be addressed for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Position-Aware Self-supervised Representation Learning for Cross-mode Radar Signal Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar signal recognition in open electromagnetic environments is challenging due to diverse operating modes and unseen radar types. Existing methods often overlook position relations in pulse sequences, limiting their ability to capture semantic dependencies over time. We propose RadarPos, a position-aware self-supervised framework that leverages pulse-level temporal dynamics without complex augmentations or masking, providing improved position relation modeling over contrastive learning or masked reconstruction. Using this framework, we evaluate cross-mode radar signal recognition under the long-tailed setting to assess adaptability and generalization. Experimental results demonstrate enhanced discriminability and robustness, highlighting practical applicability in real-world electromagnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid operator learning of wave scattering maps in high-contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of wave propagation and scattering (i.e. the wave speed and source to wave field map) in heterogeneous media has significant potential in applications such as seismic imaging and inversion. High-contrast settings, such as subsurface models with salt bodies, exhibit strong scattering and phase sensitivity that challenge existing neural operators. We propose a hybrid architecture that decomposes the scattering operator into two separate contributions: a smooth background propagation and a high-contrast scattering correction. The smooth component is learned with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which produces globally coupled feature tokens encoding background wave propagation; these tokens are then passed to a vision transformer, where attention is used to model the high-contrast scattering correction dominated by strong, spatial interactions. Evaluated on high-frequency Helmholtz problems with strong contrasts, the hybrid model achieves substantially improved phase and amplitude accuracy compared to standalone FNOs or transformers, with favorable accuracy-parameter scaling.</description>

      <title>Target Induced Angle Grid Regularized Estimation for Ghost Identification in Automotive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel algorithm for identifying ghost targets in automotive radar by estimating complex valued signal strength across a two-dimensional angle grid defined by direction-of-arrival (DOA) and direction-of-departure (DOD). In real-world driving environments, radar signals often undergo multipath propagation due to reflections from surfaces such as guardrails. These indirect paths can produce ghost targets - false detections that appear at incorrect locations - posing challenges to autonomous navigation. A recent method, the Multi-Path Iterative Adaptive Approach (MP-IAA), addresses this by jointly estimating the DOA/DOD angle grid, identifying mismatches as indicators of ghost targets. However, its effectiveness declines in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. To enhance robustness, we introduce a physics-inspired regularizer that captures structural patterns inherent to multipath propagation. This regularizer is incorporated into the estimation cost, forming a new loss function that guides our proposed algorithm, TIGRE (Target-Induced angle-Grid Regularized Estimation). TIGRE iteratively minimizes this regularized loss and we show that our proposed regularizer asymptotically enforces L0 sparsity on the DOA/DOD grid. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances the quality of angle-grid estimation across various multipath scenarios, particularly in low SNR environments, providing a more reliable basis for subsequent ghost target identification.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Electrical Characteristics of Complex Walls Using Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic wave propagation through complex inhomogeneous walls introduces significant distortions to through-wall radar signatures. Estimation of wall thickness, dielectric, and conductivity profiles may enable wall effects to be deconvolved from target scattering. We propose to use deep neural networks (DNNs) to estimate wall characteristics from broadband scattered electric fields on the same side of the wall as the transmitter. We demonstrate that both single deep artificial and convolutional neural networks and dual networks involving generative adversarial networks are capable of performing the highly nonlinear regression operation of electromagnetic inverse scattering for wall characterization. These networks are trained with simulation data generated from full wave solvers and validated on both simulated and real wall data with approximately 95% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Around-the-corner Radar Sensing Using Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around-the-corner radar (ACR) sensing of targets in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions has been explored for security and surveillance applications and look-ahead warning systems in automotive scenarios. Here, the targets are detected around corners without direct line-of-sight (LOS) propagation by exploiting multipath bounces from the walls. However, the overall detection metrics are weak due to the low strength of the multipath signals. Our study presents the application of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to improve radar sensing in ACR scenarios by directing incident beams on the RIS into NLOS regions. Experimental results at 5.5 GHz demonstrate that micro-Doppler signatures of the walking motion of humans can now be captured in NLOS conditions through the strategic deployment of RIS.</description>

      <title>Radar Sensing using Dual-Beam Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around-the-corner radar sensing offers an opportunity for the radar to exploit multipath scattering along walls to detect targets beyond blockages. However, the radar detection performance is limited to spotting uncooperative targets at specular angles. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) involving metasurfaces with tunable unit cells have been researched for enhancing radar coverage around corners by directing beams towards non-specular angles. This article examines how practical considerations regarding the phase tuning of unit cells impact the RIS performance. Specifically, we examine the radar cross-section (RCS) obtained from two RIS configurations: In the first, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a theoretical analog phase shift to realize idealized one-beam patterns at the desired angles. In the second configuration, each atom of the RIS is tuned based on a low-complexity, one-bit quantized element phase shift, which results in dual symmetric beams. The RIS configurations are then benchmarked with a metal plate of similar dimensions in both simulations and measurements.</description>

      <title>C-POD: An AWS Cloud Framework for Edge Pod Automation and Remote Wireless Testbed Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents C-POD, a cloud-native framework that automates the deployment and management of edge pods for seamless remote access and sharing of wireless testbeds. C-POD leverages public cloud resources and edge pods to lower the barrier to over-the-air (OTA) experimentation, enabling researchers to share and access distributed testbeds without extensive local infrastructure. A supporting toolkit has been developed for C-POD to enable flexible and scalable experimental workflows, including containerized edge environments, persistent Secure Shell (SSH) tunnels, and stable graphical interfaces. We prototype and deploy C-POD on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud to demonstrate its key features, including cloud-assisted edge pod deployment automation, elastic computing resource management, and experiment observability, by integrating two wireless testbeds that focus on RF signal generation and 5G(B) communications, respectively.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Gain Maximization for Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface: A Minkowski Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates beamforming-gain maximization for a fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS)-assisted downlink system, where each active port applies a finite-resolution unit-modulus phase selected from a discrete codebook. The resulting design couples the multi-antenna base-station (BS) beamformer with combinatorial FRIS port selection and discrete phase assignment, leading to a highly nonconvex mixed discrete optimization. To address this challenge, we develop an alternating-optimization (AO) framework that alternates between a closed-form maximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) update at the BS and an {optimal} FRIS-configuration update. The key step of the proposed FRIS configuration is a Minkowski-geometry reformulation of the FRIS codebook superposition: by convexifying the feasible reflected-sum set and exploiting support-function identities, we convert the FRIS subproblem into a one-dimensional maximization over a directional parameter. For each direction, the optimal configuration is obtained constructively via per-port directional scoring, Top-$M_o$ port selection, and optimal codeword assignment. For the practically important regular $M_p$-gon phase-shifter codebook, we further derive closed-form score expressions and establish a piecewise-smooth structure of the resulting support function, which leads to a finite critical-angle search that provably identifies the global optimum without exhaustive angular sweeping. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks, achieves near-optimal beamforming gains in exhaustive-search validations, accurately identifies the optimal direction via support-function maximization, and converges rapidly within a few AO iterations.</description>

      <title>On the Maintainability of Pinching-Antenna Systems: A Failure-Repair Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pinching-antenna system (PASS) enables wireless channel reconfiguration through optimized placement of pinching antennas along dielectric waveguides. In this article, a unified analytical framework is proposed to characterize the maintainability of PASS. Within this framework, random waveguide failures and repairs are modeled by treating the waveguide lifetime and repair time as exponentially distributed random variables, which are characterized by the failure rate and the repair rate, respectively. The operational state of the waveguide is described by a two-state continuous-time Markov chain, for which the transition probabilities and steady-state probabilities of the waveguide being working or failed are analyzed. By incorporating the randomness of the waveguide operational state into the transmission rate, system maintainability is characterized using the probability of non-zero rate (PNR) and outage probability (OP). The proposed framework is applied to both a conventional PASS employing a single long waveguide and a segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna system (SWAN) composed of multiple short waveguide segments under two operational protocols: segment switching (SS) and segment aggregation (SA). Closed-form expressions for the PNR and OP are derived for both architectures, and the corresponding scaling laws are analyzed with respect to the service-region size and the number of segments. It is proven that both SS-based and SA-based SWAN achieve higher PNR and lower OP than conventional PASS, which confirms the maintainability advantage of segmentation. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the maintainability gain of SWAN over conventional PASS increases with the number of segments, and ii) SA provides stronger maintainability than SS.</description>

      <title>EqDeepRx: Learning a Scalable MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning (ML)-based receiver algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the recent literature, they often suffer from poor scaling with increasing spatial multiplexing order and lack of explainability and generalization. This paper presents EqDeepRx, a practical deep-learning-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receiver, which is built by augmenting linear receiver processing with carefully engineered ML blocks. At the core of the receiver model is a shared-weight DetectorNN that operates independently on each spatial stream or layer, enabling near-linear complexity scaling with respect to multiplexing order. To ensure better explainability and generalization, EqDeepRx retains conventional channel estimation and augments it with a lightweight DenoiseNN that learns frequency-domain smoothing. To reduce the dimensionality of the DetectorNN inputs, the receiver utilizes two linear equalizers in parallel: a linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) equalizer with interference-plus-noise covariance estimation and a regularized zero-forcing (RZF) equalizer. The parallel equalized streams are jointly consumed by the DetectorNN, after which a compact DemapperNN produces bit log-likelihood ratios for channel decoding. 5G/6G-compliant end-to-end simulations across multiple channel scenarios, pilot patterns, and inter-cell interference conditions show improved error rate and spectral efficiency over a conventional baseline, while maintaining low-complexity inference and support for different MIMO configurations without retraining.</description>

      <title>Is Downlink Training Necessary for User-Centric Cell-Free RSMA Systems With Mobile Users?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the spectral efficiency (SE) of a ratesplitting multiple access (RSMA) enabled multi-clustered cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. The access points (APs) in each cluster serve mobile user equipments (UEs) by employing RSMA. The UEs employ successive interference cancellation to decode their data. This work emphasizes the role of downlink (DL) pilots in realizing RSMA benefits in practical CF systems with spatially-correlated Rician channels which observe random phase shifts, pilot contamination, and channel aging due to UE mobility. We numerically show that DL pilots are required for RSMA in user-centric CF mMIMO systems with channel aging to outperform spatial division multiple access. We show that the degraded channel quality due to higher UE velocity and longer resource block lengths significantly reduces the RSMA SE. Increasing the number of clusters can compensate for the SE loss.</description>

      <title>Radio Map Prediction from Noisy Environment Information and Sparse Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many works have investigated radio map and path loss prediction in wireless networks using deep learning, in particular using convolutional neural networks. However, most assume perfect environment information, which is unrealistic in practice due to sensor limitations, mapping errors, and temporal changes. We demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained with task-specific perturbations of geometry, materials, and Tx positions can implicitly compensate for prediction errors caused by inaccurate environment inputs. When tested with noisy inputs on synthetic indoor scenarios, models trained with perturbed environment data reduce error by up to 25\% compared to models trained on clean data. We verify our approach on real-world measurements, achieving 2.1 dB RMSE with noisy input data and 1.3 dB with complete information, compared to 2.3-3.1 dB for classical methods such as ray-tracing and radial basis function interpolation. Additionally, we compare different ways of encoding environment information at varying levels of detail and we find that, in the considered single-room indoor scenarios, binary occupancy encoding performs at least as well as detailed material property information, simplifying practical deployment.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structural Flexibility in SIM-Enabled Communications: From Adaptive Inter-Layer Spacing to Fully Morphable Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) have recently emerged as a promising metasurface-based physical-layer paradigm for wireless communications, enabling wave-domain signal processing through multiple cascaded metasurface layers. However, conventional SIM designs rely on rigid planar layers with fixed interlayer spacing, which constrain the propagation geometry and can lead to performance saturation as the number of layers increases. This paper investigates the potential of introducing structural flexibility into SIM-enabled communication systems. Specifically, we consider two flexible SIM architectures: distance-adaptive SIM (DSIM), where interlayer distances are optimized, and stacked flexible intelligent metasurface (SFIM), where each metasurface layer is fully morphable. We jointly design the meta-atom positions and responses together with the transmit beamformer to maximize the system sum rate under per-user rate, quantization, morphing, and interlayer distance constraints. An alternating optimization framework combining gradient projection, penalty-based method, and successive convex approximation is developed to address the resulting non-convex problems. Perturbation analysis reveals that the flexibility gains of both DSIM and SFIM scale approximately linearly with the morphing range, with SFIM exhibiting a faster growth rate. Simulation results demonstrate that flexible SIM designs mitigate performance saturation with increasing layers and achieve significant transmit power savings compared to rigid SIMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large MIMO systems rely on efficient downlink precoding to enhance data rates and improve connectivity through spatial multiplexing. However, currently employed linear precoding techniques, such as MMSE, significantly limit the achievable spectral efficiency. To meet practical error-rate targets, existing linear methods require an excessively high number of access point antennas relative to the number of supported users, leading to disproportionate increases in power consumption.Efficient non-linear processing frameworks for uplink MIMO transmissions, such as NL-COMM, have been proposed. However, downlink non-linear precoding methods, such as Vector Perturbation (VP), remain impractical for real-world deployment due to their exponentially increasing computational complexity with the number of supported streams. This work presents ViPer NL-COMM, the first practical algorithmic and implementation framework for VP-based precoding. ViPer NL-COMM extends the core principles of NL-COMM to the precoding problem, enabling scalable parallelization and real-time computational performance while maintaining the substantial spectral-efficiency benefits of VP precoding. ViPer NL-COMM consists of a novel mathematical framework and an FPGA prototype capable of supporting large MIMO configurations (up to 16x16), high-order modulation (256-QAM), and wide bandwidths (100 MHz) within practical power and resource budgets. System-level evaluations demonstrate that ViPer NL-COMM achieves target error rates using only half the number of transmit antennas required by linear precoding, yielding net power savings on the order of hundreds of Watts at the RF front end. Moreover, ViPer NL-COMM enables supporting more information streams than available AP antennas when the streams are of low-rate, paving the way for enhanced massive-connectivity scenarios in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete-Time Filters: A Unified Operational Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified tutorial treatment of continuous-time and discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, emphasizing their shared dynamical structure and the physical constraints that differentiate their realizations. Rather than introducing new mathematical tools, the manuscript revisits foundational concepts-transfer functions, poles and zeros, impulse responses, and stability-from an operational perspective rooted in practical signal processing and circuit implementation. First-order systems are used as a minimal yet expressive framework to illustrate how integration, differentiation, filtering, and delay manifest across the Laplace and Z domains. Particular attention is given to causality, bandwidth limitations, sampling effects, and the approximation errors inherent in discrete-time representations. The goal is to bridge the gap between formal mathematical descriptions and the intuition required for reliable system design in mixed analog-digital environments.</description>

      <title>AM-FM: A Foundation Model for Ambient Intelligence Through WiFi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient intelligence, continuously understanding human presence, activity, and physiology in physical spaces, is fundamental to smart environments, health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. WiFi infrastructure provides a ubiquitous, always-on, privacy-preserving substrate for this capability across billions of IoT devices. Yet this potential remains largely untapped, as wireless sensing has typically relied on task-specific models that require substantial labeled data and limit practical deployment. We present AM-FM, the first foundation model for ambient intelligence and sensing through WiFi. AM-FM is pre-trained on 9.2 million unlabeled Channel State Information (CSI) samples collected over 439 days from 20 commercial device types deployed worldwide, learning general-purpose representations via contrastive learning, masked reconstruction, and physics-informed objectives tailored to wireless signals. Evaluated on public benchmarks spanning nine downstream tasks, AM-FM shows strong cross-task performance with improved data efficiency, demonstrating that foundation models can enable scalable ambient intelligence using existing wireless infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Coupler Position Optimization and Channel Estimation for Flexible Coupler Aided Multiuser Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a distributed flexible coupler (FC) array to enhance communication performance with low hardware cost. At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Dispersion Accumulation in Fiber Loops for Realizing Record-High Frequency Resolution or Ultra-Low Signal Sampling Rate in Dispersion-Based Photonics-Assisted Wideband Microwave Measurement Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersion-based photonics-assisted microwave measurement systems provide immense potential for real-time analysis of wideband and dynamic signals. However, they face two critical challenges: a difficulty in achieving high frequency resolution over a wideband analysis bandwidth, and a reliance on large-bandwidth-and-high-sampling-rate oscilloscopes to capture the resulting ultra-narrow pulses. We introduce a dynamic dispersion accumulation technique to overcome these limitations. By circulating the optical signal in fiber loops containing a dispersion-compensating fiber, we achieve a high accumulated dispersion of -215700 ps/nm. This high dispersion relaxes the required chirp rate of the chirped optical signal, enabling two distinct advantages: When the analysis bandwidth is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a longer temporal period, yielding a record-high frequency resolution of 27.9 MHz; When the temporal period is fixed, a lower chirp rate enables a smaller bandwidth, generating a wider pulse and thus relaxing pulse sampling requirements at the expense of analysis bandwidth. This sacrifice in analysis bandwidth can be compensated by a duty-cycle-enabling technique, which holds the potential to extend the analysis bandwidth beyond 100 GHz. This work breaks the performance and hardware limitations in dispersion-based systems, paving the way for high frequency resolution, wideband microwave measurement systems that are both real-time and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Penalty-Optimised Illumination Design for Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing via the Extendable Framework TVAM AID Using the Core Imaging Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tomographic Volumetric Additive Manufacturing(TVAM) is a novel manufacturing method that allows for the fast creation of objects of complex geometry in layerless fashion. The process is based on the solidification of photopolymer that occurs when a sufficient threshold dose of light-energy is absorbed. In order to create complex shapes, an illumination plan must be designed to force solidification in some desired areas while leaving other regions liquid. Determining an illumination plan can be considered as an optimisation problem where a variety of objective functionals (penalties) can be used. This work considers a selection of penalty functions and their impact on selected printing metrics; linking the shape of penalty functions to ranges of light-energy dose levels in in-part regions that should be printed and out-of-part regions that should remain liquid. Further, the threshold parameters that are typically used to demarcate minimum light-energy for in-part regions and maximum light-energy for out-of-part regions are investigated systematically as design parameters on both existing and new methods. This enables the characterisation of their effects on some selected printing metrics as well as informed selection for default values. This work is underpinned by a reproducible and extensible framework, TVAM Adaptive Illumination Design(TVAM AID), which makes use of the open-source Core Imaging Library(CIL) that is designed for tomographic imaging with an emphasis on reconstruction. The foundation of TVAM AID which is presented here can hence be easily enhanced by existing functionality in CIL thus lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging use of strategies that already exist for reconstruction optimisation.</description>

      <title>Transmit or Idle: Efficient AoI Optimal Transmission Policy for Gossiping Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimal transmission and scheduling policy for a transmitter (source) communicating with two gossiping receivers aiming at tracking the source's status over time using the age of information (AoI) metric. Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Bayes' Rule and Its Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayes' rule has enabled innumerable powerful algorithms of statistical signal processing and statistical machine learning. However, when model misspecifications exist in prior and/or data distributions, the direct application of Bayes' rule is questionable. Philosophically, the key is to balance the relative importance between the prior information and the data evidence when calculating posterior distributions: If prior distributions are overly conservative (i.e., exceedingly spread), we upweight the prior belief; if prior distributions are overly aggressive (i.e., exceedingly concentrated), we downweight the prior belief. The same operation also applies to likelihood distributions, which are defined as normalized likelihoods if the normalization exists. This paper studies a generalized Bayes' rule, called uncertainty-aware (UA) Bayes' rule, to technically realize the above philosophy, thus combating model uncertainties in prior and/or data distributions. In particular, the advantage of the proposed UA Bayes' rule over the existing power posterior (i.e., $\alpha$-posterior) is investigated. Applications of the UA Bayes' rule on classification and estimation are discussed: Specifically, the UA naive Bayes classifier, the UA Kalman filter, the UA particle filter, and the UA interactive-multiple-model filter are suggested and experimentally validated.</description>

      <title>EEG2GAIT: A Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network for EEG-based Gait Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoding gait dynamics from EEG signals presents significant challenges due to the complex spatial dependencies of motor processes, the need for accurate temporal and spectral feature extraction, and the scarcity of high-quality gait EEG datasets. To address these issues, we propose EEG2GAIT, a novel hierarchical graph-based model that captures multi-level spatial embeddings of EEG channels using a Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) Pyramid. To further improve decoding performance, we introduce a Hybrid Temporal-Spectral Reward (HTSR) loss function, which integrates time-domain, frequency-domain, and reward-based loss components. In addition, we contribute a new Gait-EEG Dataset (GED), consisting of synchronized EEG and lower-limb joint angle data collected from 50 participants across two laboratory visits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EEG2GAIT with HTSR achieves superior performance on the GED dataset, reaching a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.959, a coefficient of determination of 0.914, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.193. On the MoBI dataset, EEG2GAIT likewise consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving an r of 0.779, a coefficient of determination of 0.597, and an MAE of 4.384. Statistical analyses confirm that these improvements are significant compared to all prior models. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of the hierarchical GCN modules and the proposed HTSR loss, while saliency analysis highlights the involvement of motor-related brain regions in decoding tasks. Collectively, these findings underscore EEG2GAIT's potential for advancing brain-computer interface applications, particularly in lower-limb rehabilitation and assistive technologies.</description>

      <title>EEG-to-Gait Decoding via Phase-Aware Representation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent recognition and control. This study presents NeuroDyGait, a two-stage, phase-aware EEG-to-gait decoding framework that explicitly models temporal continuity and domain relationships. To address challenges of causal, phase-consistent prediction and cross-subject variability, Stage I learns semantically aligned EEG-motion embeddings via relative contrastive learning with a cross-attention-based metric, while Stage II performs domain relation-aware decoding through dynamic fusion of session-specific heads. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (GED and FMD) show substantial gains over baselines, including a recent 2025 model EEG2GAIT. The framework generalizes to unseen subjects and maintains inference latency below 5 ms per window, satisfying real-time BCI requirements. Visualization of learned attention and phase-specific cortical saliency maps further reveals interpretable neural correlates of gait phases. Future extensions will target rehabilitation populations and multimodal integration.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a simple linear model of the cochlea as a set of vibrating strings. We make hypothesis that the information sent to the auditory cortex is the energy stored in the strings and consider all oscillation modes of the strings. We show the emergence of the sub-harmonic series whose existence was hypothesized in the XVI century to explain the consonance of the minor chord. We additionally show how the nonlinearity of the energy can be used to study the emergence of the combination tone (Tartini's third sound) shedding new light on this long debated subject.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Box Decoding is a sort-free tree-search MIMO detector whose complexity is independent of the QAM order, achieved by searching a fixed candidate box around a zero-forcing (ZF) estimate. However, without pruning, the number of visited nodes grows exponentially with the MIMO dimension, limiting scalability. This work proposes two deterministic, low-complexity, sort-free pruning strategies to control node growth. By exploiting the geometric symmetry of the QAM grid and the relative displacement between the ZF estimate and nearby constellation points, the proposed methods eliminate unnecessary metric evaluations while preserving QAM-order independence. The resulting detector achieves substantial complexity reduction with negligible error-rate degradation and enables fully parallel, hardware-efficient implementations for large-scale MIMO and higher-order QAM systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Design of Active RIS-Assisted Satellite Downlinks under Interference, Folded Noise, and EIRP Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can mitigate the double-fading loss of passive reflection in satellite downlinks. However, their gains are limited by random co-channel interference, gain-dependent amplifier noise, and regulatory emission constraints. This paper develops a stochastic reliability framework for active RIS-assisted satellite downlinks by modeling the desired and interfering channels, receiver noise, and RIS amplifier noise as random variables. The resulting instantaneous signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) model explicitly captures folded cascaded amplifier noise and reveals a finite high-gain SINR ceiling.
  To guarantee a target outage level, we formulate a chance-constrained max-SINR design that jointly optimizes the binary RIS configuration and a common amplification gain. The chance constraint is handled using a sample-average approximation (SAA) with a violation budget. The resulting feasibility problem is solved as a mixed-integer second-order cone program (MISOCP) within a bisection search over the SINR threshold. Practical implementation is enforced by restricting the gain to an admissible range determined by small-signal stability and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) limits.
  We also derive realization-wise SINR envelopes based on eigenvalue and l1-norm bounds, which provide interpretable performance limits and fast diagnostics. Monte Carlo results show that these envelopes tightly bound the simulated SINR, reproduce the predicted saturation behavior, and quantify performance degradation as interference increases. Overall, the paper provides a solver-ready, reliability-targeting design methodology whose achieved reliability is validated through out-of-sample Monte Carlo testing under realistic randomness and hardware constraints.</description>

      <title>QoE-Driven Multi-Task Offloading for Semantic-Aware Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides low-latency offloading solutions for computationally intensive tasks, effectively improving the computing efficiency and battery life of mobile devices. However, for data-intensive tasks or scenarios with limited uplink bandwidth, network congestion might occur due to massive simultaneous offloading nodes, increasing transmission latency and affecting task performance. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware multi-modal task offloading framework to address the challenges posed by limited uplink bandwidth. By introducing a semantic extraction factor, we balance the relationship among transmission latency, computation energy consumption, and task performance. To measure the offloading performance of multi-modal tasks, we design a unified and fair quality of experience (QoE) metric that includes execution latency, energy consumption, and task performance. Lastly, we formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and exploit the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) reinforcement learning algorithm to jointly optimize the semantic extraction factor, communication resources, and computing resources to maximize overall QoE. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a reduction in execution latency and energy consumption of 18.1% and 12.9%, respectively compared with the semantic-unaware approach. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to models with different user preferences.</description>

Abstract: Vascular remodelling is inherent to the pathogenesis of many diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, fibrosis, hypertension, and diabetes. In this paper, a new susceptibility-contrast based MRI approach is established to analyse intravoxel vessel size distribution (VSD) enabling more comprehensive and quantitative assessment of vascular remodelling than existing clinical imaging modalities. We use segmented vascular structures from light-sheet fluorescence microscopy images of whole rodent brain to simulate gradient echo sampling of free induction decay and spin echo sequence (GESFIDE) and train a deep learning model to predict cerebral blood volume (CBV) and VSD from the simulated GESFIDE signal. The results from ex vivo experiments showed strong correlation (r=0.96) between the true and predicted CBV. Also, high similarity between true and predicted VSDs was observed with mean Bhattacharya Coefficient being 0.92. With further in vivo validation, intravoxel VSD imaging could become a transformative clinical tool for interrogating disease and treatment induced vascular remodelling.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on AI-Empowered Integrated A Tutorial on AI-Empowered Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>

Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) can help overcome the challenges of limited spectrum and expensive hardware, leading to improved energy and cost efficiency. While full cooperation between sensing and communication can result in significant performance gains, achieving optimal performance requires efficient designs of unified waveforms and beamformers for joint sensing and communication. Sophisticated statistical signal processing and multi-objective optimization techniques are necessary to balance the competing design requirements of joint sensing and communication tasks. As model-based approaches can be suboptimal or too complex, deep learning offers a powerful data-driven alternative, especially when optimal algorithms are unknown or impractical for real-time use. Unified waveform and beamformer design problems for ISAC fall into this category, where fundamental design trade-offs exist between sensing and communication performance metrics, and the underlying models may be inadequate or incomplete. This tutorial paper explores the application of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance efficiency or reduce complexity in ISAC designs. We emphasize the integration benefits through AI-driven ISAC designs, prioritizing the development of unified waveforms, constellations, and beamforming strategies for both sensing and communication. To illustrate the practical potential of AI-driven ISAC, we present three case studies on waveform, beamforming, and constellation design, demonstrating how unsupervised learning and neural network-based optimization can effectively balance performance, complexity, and implementation constraints.</description>

      <title>SATversary: Adversarial Attacks and Defenses for Satellite Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the increasing threat of attacks on satellite systems, novel countermeasures have been developed to provide additional security. Among these, there has been a particular interest in transmitter fingerprinting, which authenticates transmitters by looking at characteristics expressed in the physical layer signal. These systems rely heavily upon statistical methods and machine learning, and are therefore vulnerable to a range of attacks. The severity of this threat in a fingerprinting context is currently not well understood.
  In this paper we evaluate a range of attacks against satellite fingerprinting, building on previous works by looking at attacks optimized to target the fingerprinting system for maximal impact. We design optimized jamming, dataset poisoning, and spoofing attacks, evaluating them in the real world against the SatIQ fingerprinting system designed to authenticate Iridium transmitters, and using a wireless channel emulator to achieve realistic channel conditions. We show that an optimized jamming signal can cause a 50% error rate with attacker-to-victim ratios as low as -30dB (far less power than traditional jamming techniques), and demonstrate successful spoofing attacks, with an attacker successfully removing their own transmitter's fingerprint from messages. We also present a viable dataset poisoning attack, enabling persistent message spoofing by altering stored data to include the fingerprint of the attacker's transmitter.
  Finally, we show that a model trained to optimize spoofing attacks can also be used to detect spoofing and replay attacks, even when it has never seen the attacker's transmitter before. This technique works even when the training dataset includes only a single transmitter, enabling fingerprinting to be used to protect small constellations and even individual satellites, providing additional protection where it is needed the most.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveforms for IoT-Centric Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is considered a key enabler to support application scenarios such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) in which both communications and sensing play significant roles. Multi-carrier waveforms, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), have been considered as good candidates for ISAC due to their high communications data rate and good time bandwidth property for sensing. Nevertheless, their high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) values lead to either performance degradation or an increase in system complexity. This can make OFDM unsuitable for IoT applications with insufficient resources in terms of power, system complexity, hardware size or cost. This article provides IoT-centric constant modulus waveform designs that leverage the advantage of unit PAPR and thus are more suitable in resource-limited scenarios. More specifically, several single-carrier frequency and/or phase-modulated waveforms are considered. A comprehensive discussion on their radar sensing and communications performance is conducted based on performance metrics, including the radar ambiguity function, the bandwidth property, the data rate, and the communications receiver complexity.</description>

      <title>Lightweight and Generalizable Acoustic Scene Representations via Contrastive Fine-Tuning and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance.</description>
