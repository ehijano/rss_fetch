      <title>Nonautonomous modelling in Energy Balance Models of climate. Limitations of averaging and climate sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from a classical Budyko-Sellers-Ghil energy balance model for the average surface temperature of the Earth, a nonautonomous version is designed by allowing the solar irradiance and the cloud cover coefficients to vary with time in a fast timescale, and to exhibit chaos in a precise sense. The dynamics of this model is described in terms of three existing nonautonomous equilibria, the upper one being attracting and representing the present temperature profile. The theory of averaging is used to compare the nonautonomous model and its time-averaged version. We analyse the influence of the qualitative properties of the time-dependent coefficients and develop physically significant error estimates close to the upper attracting solution. Furthermore, previous concepts of two-point response and sensitivity functions are adapted to the nonautonomous context and used to value the increase in temperature when a forcing caused by CO2 and other emissions intervenes.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Probabilistic Air-Sea Flux Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately quantifying air-sea fluxes is important for understanding air-sea interactions and improving coupled weather and climate systems. This study introduces a probabilistic framework to represent the highly variable nature of air-sea fluxes, which is missing in deterministic bulk algorithms. Assuming Gaussian distributions conditioned on the input variables, we use artificial neural networks and eddy-covariance measurement data to estimate the mean and variance by minimizing negative log-likelihood loss. The trained neural networks provide alternative mean flux estimates to existing bulk algorithms, and quantify the uncertainty around the mean estimates. Stochastic parameterization of air-sea turbulent fluxes can be constructed by sampling from the predicted distributions. Tests in a single-column forced upper-ocean model suggest that changes in flux algorithms influence sea surface temperature and mixed layer depth seasonally. The ensemble spread in stochastic runs is most pronounced during spring restratification.</description>

      <title>Decaying turbulence beneath surface waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores decaying turbulence beneath surface waves that is initially isotropic and shear-free. We start by presenting phenomenology revealed by wave-averaged numerical simulations: an accumulation of angular momentum in coherent vortices, suppression of kinetic energy dissipation, and the development of depth-alternating jets. We interpret these features through an analogy with rotating turbulence (Holm 1996), wherein the curl of the Stokes drift, $\nabla \times \mathbf{u}^S$, takes on the role of the background vorticity (for example, $(f_0 + \beta y) \mathbf{\hat z}$ on the $\beta$-plane). We pursue this thread further by showing that a two-equation model proposed by (Bardina et al. 1985) for rotating turbulence reproduces the simulated evolution of volume-integrated kinetic energy. This success of the two-equation model -- which explicitly parameterizes wave-driven suppression of kinetic energy dissipation -- carries implications for modeling turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer. We conclude with a discussion about a wave-averaged analogue of the Rossby number appearing in the two-equation model, which we term the ``pseudovorticity number'' after the pseudovorticity $\nabla \times \mathbf{u}^S$. The pseudovorticity number is related to the Langmuir number in an integral sense.</description>
