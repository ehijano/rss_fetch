      <title>A note on D-functions and P-covariances on Hilbert spaces and related inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we first review the concept of D-function, closely connected with Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and then introduce the notion of P-covariance on a Hilbert space, where $P$ is an orthogonal projection. We show that when P is specialized to be one-dimensional many well-known inequalities such as Buzano, Richard and Walker inequalities are simple consequences of P-covariance inequalities and their relation with D-functions. By means of these concepts enhancements of the previous mentioned inequalities are also established with minimum effort. A more thorough analysis of Walker inequality is presented jointly with some novel financial considerations as well as a new refinement of Holder inequality.</description>

      <title>The 2p order Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principles related to the offset linear canonical transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental tools for time-frequency analysis in harmonic analysis, revealing the intrinsic trade-off between time and frequency resolutions. With the continuous development of various advanced time-frequency analysis methods based on the Fourier transform, investigating uncertainty principles associated with these methods has become one of the most interesting topics. This paper studies the uncertainty principles related to the offset linear canonical transform, including the Plancherel-Parseval-Rayleigh identity, the $2p$ order Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle and the sharpened Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle. Numerical simulations are also proposed to validate the derived results.</description>

      <title>On a class of coupled fractional nonlinear singular boundary value problems arising in dusty fluid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new class of coupled fractional Lane-Emden boundary value problems. We employ a novel approach, the fractional Haar wavelet collocation method with the Newton-Raphson method. We analyze the conditions in two cases to present numerical experiments related to the defined system of fractional differential equations. To validate the accuracy of the proposed method we present the convergence of the method, and we demonstrate the method's effectiveness through five numerical experiments, highlighting real-world applications of fractional differential equations. Using figures and tables, we show that the residual error decreases as we increase the value of the maximum level of resolution $J$ while keeping the order of derivatives fixed, and similar trends also observe when $J$ is fixed and vary the order of fractional derivatives. We demonstrate that Mathematica software can be used effectively to solve such nonlinear singular fractional boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>An Application of Fractional Calculus to Column Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we employ a fractional version of the radius of curvature in Euler's equation for column buckling, enabling us to derive a fractional differential equation in the Caputo sense. We solve this equation and demonstrate that for certain values of the fractional parameter, there exists a critical buckling force. Additionally, we provide a numerical scheme for accurately approximating this critical force.</description>

      <title>Conditions for solving polynomial equations using algebraic and hypergeometric functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on clarifying the concept of solving equations of degree greater than six using continuous functions or hypergeometric functions and providing another proof of the non-existence of algebraic solutions for equations of degree greater than four. According to the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, we will prove that equations of degree greater than five cannot be solved without special conditions between their coefficients using hypergeometric functions. However, we prove that trinomial equations of general form can in general be solved using hypergeometric functions.</description>

      <title>Weakly Compatible Mappings and Common Fixed Points Under Generalized Contractive Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new common fixed point theorems for weakly compatible mappings in metric spaces, relaxing traditional requirements such as continuity, compatibility, and reciprocal continuity. We present a unified framework for three self-mappings $T$, $f$, and $g$ with a contractive condition involving a control function $\psi$, along with corollaries extending results to pairs of mappings and upper semi-continuous control functions. Further generalizations include iterated mappings and sequences of mappings. Rigorous examples demonstrate the necessity of hypotheses and show our results strictly generalize theorems by Al-Thagafi \emph{et. al.} \cite{Al-Thagafi2006}, Babu \emph{et. al.} \cite{Babu2007}, Jungck \cite{Jungck1976,Jungck1986}, Singh \cite{Singh1986,Singh1997a}, Som \cite{Som2003}, Song \cite{Song2007} and Zhang \emph{et. al.} \cite{Zhang2008}. Key advancements include eliminating completeness assumptions on the entire space and relaxing mapping compatibility conditions.</description>

      <title>An Addendum to Plouffe's Ramanujan Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of polylogarithm sums closely related to a family studied by L. Vep\v{s}tas in 2010. These generalized sums depend on two free parameters and yield closed-form expressions involving the Dirichlet eta function. Additionally, we present an alternative proof for a hyperbolic sum originally discussed by Ramanujan.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points of the Josephus Function via Fractional Base Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated some interesting properties of the fixed points of the Josephus function $J_3$. First, we establish a connection between this sequence and the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Next, we observed a clear numerical pattern in the fixed points sequence when the terms are written in base $3/2$ using modular arithmetic, which allows us to develop a recursive procedure to determine the digits of their base $3/2$ expansions.</description>

      <title>Conjecture: the set of prime numbers is supernatural</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prime numbers are fascinating by the way they appear in the set of natural numbers. Despite several results enlighting us about their repartition, the set of prime numbers is often informally qualified as misterious. In the present paper, we introduce a formalism allowing to state a formal conjecture: the set of prime numbers is supernatural. Our conjecture has no analog in the existing literature. This conjecture is expected to be a hard challenge for any kind of intelligence. We also find a Fermat-like function giving more prime numbers than Fermat's function.</description>
