      <title>Calibration of Binary Population Synthesis Models Using White Dwarf Binaries from APOGEE, GALEX and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effectiveness and stability of mass transfer in binaries system are crucial in determining its final product. Rapid binary population synthesis (BPS) codes simplify the complex physics of mass transfer by adopting parameterized prescriptions for the stability of mass transfer, accretion efficiency in stable mass transfer, and the efficiency of common-envelope ejection. We calibrate these uncertain parameters by comparing BPS models with observational data. White dwarf and main sequence binaries are an ideal population to study binary interaction, as they can be formed through stable or unstable mass transfer, or without interaction, which affect the orbital period and masses of the present-day population. The APOGEE-GALEX-Gaia catalog provides a homogeneous sample of over 500 systems with well measured radial velocities that can be used as a comparison baseline for BPS simulations of such binaries. We compare the distribution of observed maximum radial velocity variation ($\Delta RV_{\rm max}$) and estimated masses to BPS models simulated with COSMIC, varying the mass transfer and common-envelope ejection efficiency, and the criteria for mass transfer stability at key evolutionary stages. The $\Delta RV_{\rm max}$ comparison shows clear preference for a higher fraction of stable mass transfer during the first ascent giant branch, and for highly effective envelope ejection. For the systems with WD masses, there is a slight preference for non-conservative mass transfer. In COSMIC and similar codes, the envelope ejection efficiency and the envelope binding energy are degenerate parameters. Our result of high ejection efficiency may indicate that either additional sources of energy are required to eject the envelope, or that its binding energy is lower than traditionally assumed. Future comparisons to BPS simulations can be drawn for other datasets as they become available.</description>

      <title>A magnitude-limited catalogue of unresolved white dwarf-main sequence binaries from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars containing a white dwarf and a main-sequence star, WDMS binaries, can be used to study a wide range of aspects of stellar astrophysics. We build a magnitude-limited sample of unresolved WDMS binaries from Gaia DR3 to enlarge these studies. We look for WDMS with available spectra whose location in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram bridges between the evolutionary sequences of single white dwarfs and the main-sequence. To exclude spurious sources we apply quality cuts on the Gaia photometry and astrometry and we fit the SED (spectral energy distribution) of the objects with VOSA (Virtual Observatory SED Analyser) to exclude single sources. We further clean the sample via visual inspection of the Gaia spectra and publicly available images of the objects. We re-fit the SEDs of the finally selected WDMS with VOSA using composite models to measure their stellar parameters and we search for eclipsing systems by inspecting available ZTF and CRTS light curves. The catalogue consists of 1312 WDMS and we manage to derive stellar parameters for 435. This is because most WDMS are dominated by the main-sequence companions, making it hard to derive parameters for the white dwarfs. We also identify 67 eclipsing systems and estimate a lower limit to the completeness of the sample to be ~50% (~5% if we consider that not all WDMS in the studied region have Gaia spectra). Our catalogue increases by one order of magnitude the volume-limited sample we presented in our previous work. Despite the fact that the sample is incomplete and suffers from heavy observational biases, it is well characterised and can therefore be used to further constrain binary evolution by comparing the observed properties to those from synthetic samples obtained modeling the WDMS population in the Galaxy, taking into account all selection effects.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Ly{\alpha} Emission Observed by the Solar Disk Imager Aboard the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The H I Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission, with a wavelength of 1216 \r{A}, is the brightest solar ultraviolet (UV) line. However, comprehensive observations of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line across the full solar disk remain limited. As part of the ASO-S mission, the Solar Disk Imager (SDI) has successfully captured full-disk images in the Ly$\alpha$ band. Gaussian fitting of SDI's spectral response function (SRF) yields a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of approximately 85 \r{A}, which is significantly broader than the distance of Si III line at 1206 \r{A} and the Ly$\alpha$ line. Thus, the emission contribution of Si III to the SDI Ly$\alpha$ passband needs to be considered. For flares, in practice, we calculated the integrated intensity ratio $I$(Si III)/$I$(Ly$\alpha$) by analyzing spectral observations from the SOLSTICE instrument. It yields values between 1.7% and 14.6%. Empirically, the ratio is proportional to the SXR flux. Further analysis of spectral data from the SUMER instrument reveals that the ratio $I$(Si III)/$I$(Ly$\alpha$) is approximately 0.5% for prominences, 0.7%--0.9% for the inner disk, and 1.4%--1.9% close to the limb. These findings suggest that $I$(Si III)/$I$(Ly$\alpha$) is minimal for prominences and the inner disk, and the varying ratios across regions align with the center-to-limb variation of the Si III and Ly$\alpha$ lines. Additionally, we compared Ly$\alpha$ image intensity with 304 \r{A}, 1600 \r{A}, and 1700 \r{A} observations from AIA, as well as H$\alpha$ from CHASE, in multiple regions (a prominence region, two active regions, and a quiet region). A relatively higher correlation of about 85% is found between Ly$\alpha$ and 304 \r{A} in active regions, whereas in the quiet region and prominence, their correlation coefficients are about 55%.</description>

      <title>Eclipsing millisecond pulsars with He star companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eclipsing millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are a type of pulsar binaries with close orbits ($\lesssim1.0\,$d). They are important objects for studying the accretion history of neutron stars (NSs), pulsar winds, and the origin of isolated MSPs, etc. Recently, a new eclipsing MSP, PSR J$1928+1815$, was discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. It is the first known pulsar with a He star companion, as suggested in Yang et al. The system features a short orbital period of $\sim0.15\,$d and a relatively massive companion $\gtrsim1.0\,M_\odot$. However, the origin of PSR J$1928+1815$ remains highly uncertain. In this paper, we investigated the formation of the new subclass of eclipsing MSPs containing (evolved) He star companions through NS + He star channel. We found that if a NS binary undergoes subsequent mass-transfer phases following Case BA or Case BB, it may appear as an eclipsing MSP during the detached phase. Additionally, we obtained the initial parameter space for producing eclipsing MSPs with He star companions. Using binary population synthesis approach, we estimated their birth rate to be $\sim2.1-4.7\times10^{-4}\rm\,yr^{-1}$, corresponding to a total number of $\sim55-150$ systems in the Galaxy. Moreover, we concluded that PSR J$1928+1815$ may originate from the evolution of an NS+He star system with an initial orbital period of $\sim0.1\,$d, which can undergo the Case BB mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Improving 1D stellar atmosphere models with insights from multi-dimensional simulations II. 1D versus 3D hydrodynamically consistent model comparison for WR stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars are evolved massive stars that have lost most of their H envelope and exhibit dense, extended atmospheres with strong, line-driven winds. Accurately modeling wind launching from optically thick layers remains a challenge. Two main approaches have advanced our understanding: 1D stationary atmosphere models with consistent hydrodynamics and time-dependent, multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Due to high computational demands, multi-dimensional models are limited in scope. Therefore, 1D hydrodynamically consistent models remain essential but must incorporate insights from 3D simulations. We compare averaged stratifications from recent multi-dimensional cWR models with 1D models computed using the hydrodynamically consistent PoWR$^{HD}$ code. We focus on winds driven by the hot iron opacity bump and explore how variations in 1D input parameters affect model outcomes. The 1D models reproduce the average 3D density structure well. While mass-loss rates are typically $\lesssim$0.2 dex higher in 1D models, small adjustments accounting for multi-dimensional dispersion reconcile the differences. 1D models tend to be more radially extended, with higher terminal velocities and lower effective temperatures. They reproduce the general velocity trends of 3D models but launch winds slightly further out and reach higher velocities during the hot iron bump. These differences also manifest in synthetic spectra computed from different 1D model approaches. Despite methodological variations, both 1D and averaged 3D models yield consistent stellar parameters when accounting for the variability seen in time-dependent simulations. For stars near the Eddington limit, reducing Doppler velocities in 1D models improves agreement in mass-loss rates, temperatures, and wind velocities. Matching temperature structures in optically thin layers remains an open challenge.</description>

      <title>A neural network approach to determining photometric metallicities of M-type dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy and serve as key targets for stellar and exoplanetary studies. It is particularly challenging to determine their metallicities because their spectra are complex. For this reason, several authors have focused on photometric estimates of the M-dwarf metallicity. Although artificial neural networks have been used in the framework of modern astrophysics, their application to a photometric metallicity estimate for M dwarfs remains unexplored. We develop an accurate method for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs using artificial neural networks to address the limitations of traditional empirical approaches. We trained a neural network on a dataset of M dwarfs with spectroscopically derived metallicities. We used eight absolute magnitudes in the visible and infrared from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE as input features. Batch normalization and dropout regularization stabilized the training and prevented overfitting. We applied the Monte Carlo dropout technique to obtain more robust predictions. The neural network demonstrated a strong performance in estimating photometric metallicities for M dwarfs in the range of -0.45&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;0.45dex and for spectral types as late as M5.0V. On the test sample, the predictions showed uncertainties down to 0.08dex. This surpasses the accuracy of previous methods. We further validated our results using an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in wide binary systems with FGK-type primary stars with well-defined metallicities and achieved an excellent predictive performance that surpassed the 0.1dex error threshold. This study introduces a ML-based framework for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs and provides a scalable data-driven solution for analyzing large photometric surveys. The results outline the potential of artificial neural networks to enhance the determination of stellar parameters.</description>

      <title>Trumpler's Radial Velocities of Stars in Galactic Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the accuracy of radial velocities of 671 stars located near Galactic clusters, measured by Robert Trumpler between 1924 and 1947 using the Lick Observatory 36 inch refractor equipped with prism spectrometers. We find that Trumpler's velocities share the same zero-point and scale as modern IAU radial velocity standards. Their accuracy ranges from 2 to 7 km/s. We also provide star identifications, B-band photometry, and notes for many stars. We provide a link to an online PDF that contains all 3,782 of Trumpler's individual stellar radial velocities and associated Julian dates. Trumpler's velocities provide a century-long baseline for detecting long-period stellar companions, gravitational perturbations from passing massive objects, and accelerations due to cluster and Galactic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Study on physical properties and characteristics of an anisotropic compact star model using Karmarkar Condition in F(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to examine the behaviour of physical parameters of an anisotropic compact star model demonstrating spherical symmetry in F(Q) modified gravity. To evaluate the behaviour and the stability of an anisotropic compact star model, we utilise the measured mass and radius of an anisotropic compact star model. This study obtained an anisotropic compact star model by solving Einstein field equations. The field equations have been simplified by an appropriate selection of the metric elements and the Karmarkar condition. By solving the field equation to develop a differential equation that establishes a relationship between two essential components of spacetime. A physical analysis of this model reveals that the resulting stellar structure for anisotropic matter distribution is a physically plausible representation of a compact star with an energy density of order $10^14 g/cm^3$. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, causality condition and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov Condition, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and stability of the compact star Cen X-3. We further determined the mass-radius relation of this compact star for different values of delta}1.</description>

      <title>Chemical Abundances in the Milky Way's Nuclear Stellar Disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) is a rotating, disc-like structure in the Galactic Center, believed to have a distinct star formation. However, its formation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic Center remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive chemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M giants in the metallicity range of -1.0 &lt;[Fe/H]&lt; 0.5. By comparing these trends with those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical relationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and K-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini South telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a comparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance trends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with different chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align closely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At super-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends. Sodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced abundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars. The chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary history with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are required to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich globular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance signatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of obtaining high-quality abundance data even in highly dust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, paving the way for future surveys.</description>

      <title>Energy Spectra of Secondary Particles Induced by Solar Energetic Proton Events and Magnetospheric Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the energy spectra of secondary cosmic ray particles associated with two distinct solar events: the magnetospheric effect (ME) of 5 November 2023 and ground-level enhancement (GLE 74) of 11 May 2024. Using data from the SEVAN and Neutron Monitor networks and energy release histograms from particle spectrometers, we reconstruct spectra and identify key differences between ME and GLE. CORSIKA-based simulations reveal that MEs are caused by galactic protons below geomagnetic cutoff rigidities (Rc = 7.1 GV at Aragats) penetrating the magnetosphere during geomagnetic storms, leading to localized flux enhancements at mountain altitudes but not at sea level. In contrast, SEP events initiated by GLEs can involve high-energy solar protons (&gt;10 GeV), producing secondaries that reach sea level at middle latitudes. We present integral energy spectra and spatial correlation of detector responses, demonstrating that SEVAN's energy-resolved data offer new diagnostic tools for identifying hard-spectrum SERs. Our results refine the definition of ME and suggest a strategy for early warning of hazardous solar particle events based on real-time ground-based observations.</description>

      <title>A correlation between accretion and outflow rates for Class II Young Stellar Objects with full and transition disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetothermal (MHD) winds and jets originate in a wide range of regions of protoplanetary disks (1-30 au) and are thought to be the primary mechanisms driving accretion onto the central star. One indirect signature of these processes is the free-free emission from ionized gas close to the star. We analyze a sample of 31 Class II disks: 18 full disks (FD) and 13 transition disks (TD). All sources show evidence of excess free-free emission over the contribution of the thermal dust. We investigate the origin of this emission and whether it is associated with other observables. We first analyzed a sample of objects in Taurus, exploring correlations with the properties of the central star, the disk, and other disk-wind tracers. We compared our findings with a sample of TD for which free-free emission was shown to be likely associated with an MHD-wind/jet. We found no correlation between the detected free-free emission and either the X-ray or the [OI]6300A line properties. We found a strong correlation between the ionized mass loss rate, as inferred from the free-free emission, and the accretion rate, suggesting that free-free emission in FD is associated with an MHD-wind/jet. The detected free-free emission in both TD and FD is likely similarly associated with an ionized gas close to the star from an MHD-wind/jet. The free-free emission detected in TD shows hints of shallower correlations with accretion properties than in FD. Whereas the efficiency in transforming accretion into outflow might differ in TD and FD, considering the correlations between free-free emission and accretion properties, this difference could simply result from a bias toward strong accretors in the TD sample. Therefore, observations of a more complete and uniform sample are necessary to determine whether this change in correlations holds only for strong accretors or for TD in general.</description>

      <title>High angular resolution near-ultraviolet polarization imaging of the Herbig Ae/Be star LK-H{\alpha}-233</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that provide critical insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and protoplanetary disks.Two of the key features of such stars are their circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233 taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991, 1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality. Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this object at 4118 {\AA}, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane, bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle, indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar instruments.</description>

Abstract: Stellar flare events are critical observational samples for astronomical research; however, recorded flare events remain limited. Stellar flare forecasting can provide additional flare event samples to support research efforts. Despite this potential, no specialized models for stellar flare forecasting have been proposed to date. In this paper, we present extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that both stellar physical properties and historical flare records are valuable inputs for flare forecasting tasks. We then introduce FLARE (Forecasting Light-curve-based Astronomical Records via features Ensemble), the first-of-its-kind large model specifically designed for stellar flare forecasting. FLARE integrates stellar physical properties and historical flare records through a novel Soft Prompt Module and Residual Record Fusion Module. Our experiments on the publicly available Kepler light curve dataset demonstrate that FLARE achieves superior performance compared to other methods across all evaluation metrics. Finally, we validate the forecast capability of our model through a comprehensive case study.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>

Abstract: Aditya-L1, India's first dedicated mission to study the Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on 2023 September 2. It carries seven payloads. The Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on Aditya-L1. VELC is designed to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in the continuum at 5000 A, with a field of view (FoV) from 1.05 Ro to 3 Ro can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of the solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303 A Fexiv, 7892 A Fexi, and 10747 A Fexiii are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50 um, separated by 3.75 mm help to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to +/-1.5 Ro. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747 A also in the FoV range 1.05 - 1.5 Ro. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using a laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time. Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>

      <title>Explodability criteria for the neutrino-driven supernova mechanism</title>

Abstract: Massive stars undergoing iron core-collapse at the end of their evolution terminate their lives either in successful or failed supernovae (SNe). The physics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is complex, and their understanding requires computationally expensive simulations. Using these to predict CCSN outcomes over large, densely sampled parameter spaces of SN progenitors, as is needed e.g. for population synthesis studies, is thus not feasible. To remedy this situation, we present explodability criteria that allow us to predict the final fates of stars by evaluating stellar structure variables at the onset of core-collapse. The criteria are calibrated to predictions of a semi-analytical SN model, evaluated over a set of $\sim$~3,900 heterogeneous stellar progenitors (single, binary-stripped and accretor stars). Over these, the criteria achieve an accuracy of &gt;99\% agreement with the semi-analytical model. The criteria are tested on 29 state-of-the-art 3D CCSN simulation outcomes from two different groups.
  Furthermore, we find that all explodability proxies needed for our pre-SN structure-based criteria have two distinct peaks and intervening valleys as a function of the carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass $M_\mathrm{CO}$, which coincide with failed and successful SNe, respectively. The CO core masses of explodability peaks shift systematically with metallicity, $Z$, and with timing of hydrogen-rich envelope removal by binary mass transfer. With these, we identify critical values in $M_\mathrm{CO}$ that define windows over which black holes form by direct collapse and formulate a CCSN recipe based on $M_\mathrm{CO}$ and $Z$, applicable for rapid binary population synthesis and other studies. Our explodability formalism is consistent with observations of Type~IIP, IIb/Ib and Ic supernova progenitors and partially addresses the missing Red Supergiant Problem by direct black hole formation.</description>

      <title>Methods to Test the Source of the Extreme Gas Motions in WS 35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS 35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow, questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of $\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted mass-loss rate.</description>

      <title>The 3D Kinematics of the Orion Nebula Cluster II: Mass-dependent Kinematics of the Inner Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the kinematic analysis of $246$ stars within $4\mbox{$^\prime$}$ from the center of Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), the closest massive star cluster with active star formation across the full mass range, which provides valuable insights into the formation and evolution of star clusters on an individual-star basis. High-precision radial velocities and surface temperatures are retrieved from spectra acquired by the NIRSPEC instrument used with adaptive optics (NIRSPAO) on the Keck II 10-m telescope. A three-dimensional kinematic map is then constructed by combining with the proper motions previously measured by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFPC2/WFC3IR and Keck II NIRC2. The measured root-mean-squared velocity dispersion is $2.26\pm0.08~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, significantly higher than the virial equilibrium's requirement of $1.73~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting that the ONC core is supervirial, consistent with previous findings. Energy equipartition is not detected in the cluster. Most notably, the velocity of each star relative to its neighbors is found to be negatively correlated with stellar mass. Low-mass stars moving faster than their surrounding stars in a supervirial cluster suggest that the initial masses of forming stars may be related to their initial kinematic states. Additionally, a clockwise rotation preference is detected. A weak sign of inverse mass segregation is also identified among stars, excluding the Trapezium stars, though it could be a sample bias. Finally, this study reports the discovery of four new candidate spectroscopic binary systems.</description>

      <title>Convection and the Core $g$-mode in Proto-Compact Stars -- A detailed analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of proto-compact star (PCS) convection and the core ${}^2\!g_1$-mode in core-collapse supernovae based on general relativistic 2D and 3D neutrino hydrodynamics simulations. Based on 2D simulations, we derive a mode relation for the core $g$-mode frequency in terms of PCS and equation of state parameters, and discuss its limits of accuracy. This relation may prove useful for parameter inference from future supernova gravitational wave (GW) signals if the core $g$-mode or an emission gap at the avoided crossing with the fundamental mode can be detected. The current 3D simulation does not show GW emission from the core $g$-mode due to less power in high-frequency convective motions to excite the mode, however. Analysing the dynamics of PCS convection in 3D, we find that simple scaling laws for convective velocity from mixing-length theory (MLT) do not apply. Energy and lepton number transport is instead governed by a more complex balance between neutrino fluxes and turbulent fluxes that results in roughly uniform rates of change of entropy and lepton number in the PCS convection zone. Electron fraction and enthalpy contrasts in PCS convection are not well captured by the MLT gradient approximation. We find distinctly different spectra for the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent fluctuations in the electron fraction, which scale approximately as $l^{-1}$ without a downturn at low $l$. We suggest that the different turbulence spectrum of the electron fraction is naturally expected for a passive scalar quantity.</description>
