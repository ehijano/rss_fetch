      <title>Deep Learning without Weight Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation (BP), a foundational algorithm for training artificial neural networks, predominates in contemporary deep learning. Although highly successful, it is often considered biologically implausible. A significant limitation arises from the need for precise symmetry between connections in the backward and forward pathways to backpropagate gradient signals accurately, which is not observed in biological brains. Researchers have proposed several algorithms to alleviate this symmetry constraint, such as feedback alignment and direct feedback alignment. However, their divergence from backpropagation dynamics presents challenges, particularly in deeper networks and convolutional layers. Here we introduce the Product Feedback Alignment (PFA) algorithm. Our findings demonstrate that PFA closely approximates BP and achieves comparable performance in deep convolutional networks while avoiding explicit weight symmetry. Our results offer a novel solution to the longstanding weight symmetry problem, leading to more biologically plausible learning in deep convolutional networks compared to earlier methods.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a dynamical state of coherent bursting with power-law distributed avalanches from collective stochastic dynamics of adaptive neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous brain activity in the absence of external stimuli is not random but contains complex dynamical structures such as neuronal avalanches with power-law duration and size distributions. These experimental observations have been interpreted as supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the brain is operating at criticality and attracted much attention. Here, we show that an entire state of coherent bursting, with power-law distributed avalanches and features as observed in experiments, emerges in networks of adaptive neurons with stochastic input when excitation is sufficiently strong and balanced by adaptation. We demonstrate that these power-law distributed avalanches are direct consequences of stochasticity and the oscillatory population firing rate arising from coherent bursting, which in turn is the result of the balance between excitation and adaptation, and criticality does not play a role.</description>

      <title>Intelligent and Miniaturized Neural Interfaces: An Emerging Era in Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating smart algorithms on neural devices presents significant opportunities for various brain disorders. In this paper, we review the latest advancements in the development of three categories of intelligent neural prostheses featuring embedded signal processing on the implantable or wearable device. These include: 1) Neural interfaces for closed-loop symptom tracking and responsive stimulation; 2) Neural interfaces for emerging network-related conditions, such as psychiatric disorders; and 3) Intelligent BMI SoCs for movement recovery following paralysis.</description>
