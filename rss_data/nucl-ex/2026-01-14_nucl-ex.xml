      <title>Precise measurement of the $\Lambda$-binding energy difference between $^3_\Lambda$H and $^4_\Lambda$H via decay-pion spectroscopy at MAMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed high-precision decay-pion spectroscopy of light $\Lambda$ hypernuclei at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI) using the A1 spectrometer facility. By measuring the monochromatic $\pi^-$ momentum from the two-body weak decay $^3_\Lambda\mathrm{H} \to {}^3\mathrm{He} + \pi^-$ and referencing it to the $^4_\Lambda\mathrm{H} \to {}^4\mathrm{He} + \pi^-$ decay, we determined the $\Lambda$ binding energy of $^3_\Lambda\mathrm{H}$ with unprecedented accuracy. The obtained value, $B_\Lambda(^3_\Lambda\mathrm{H}) = 0.523 \pm 0.013~(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.075~(\mathrm{syst.})$~MeV, is consistent with the STAR result, but indicates a significantly deeper binding than inferred from earlier measurements. This result implies a stronger $\Lambda$-deuteron interaction and provides stringent constraints on hyperon-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>A New Beam Monitor at NFS/SPIRAL2 Based on Position-Sensitive PPACs Detecting Fission Fragments from ${}^{238}$U$(n,f)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new experimental setup has been installed at the Time-Of-Flight area of the Neutrons For Science facility (NFS) at GANIL/SPIRAL2 for neutron beam monitoring. This setup consists of an array of Position-Sensitive Parallel-Plate Avalanche Counters (PS-PPACs) that detects both fission fragments in coincidence from secondary neutron-induced fission reactions in several ${}^{238}$U targets. The neutron energy is determined on an event-by-event basis using the Time-of-Flight method, and the reaction point within the U targets is reconstructed, enabling the measurement of the neutron beam flux and beam profile. The high transparency of the setup allows it to operate in parallel with other experiments running at NFS, thus providing an in-beam monitor of the neutron intensity. In this work, we report on the characteristics of this new setup, its operating principle, and the first results obtained using the high-intensity white-spectrum neutron beam at NFS. This beam is produced via reactions between a primary 40-MeV deuteron beam, accelerated in the SPIRAL2 LINAC, and a 8 mm-thick rotating beryllium converter target.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Light Nuclei embedded in a Nuclear Medium: Clustering and Mott Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clustering of nucleons is a fundamental phenomenon with broad implications for nuclear physics and astrophysics. In this work, we employ a microscopic in-medium few-body approach to systematically investigate the formation and dissolution of light clusters (deuteron, $\rm{^3H}$, $\rm{^3He}$, $\alpha$-particle) embedded in nuclear medium. The medium-modified cluster structures under the Pauli blocking and the picture of Mott transitions in nuclear medium are discussed in detail. We find that the weakly bound deuteron survives to higher densities as compared with the more compact $\alpha$-particle in symmetric nuclear matter, with its r.m.s. radius expanding markedly prior to its dissolution. Moreover, the Mott density of $\alpha$-particle is slightly lower in neutron-rich matter than in symmetric matter. These results may provide useful constraints for the formation of light clusters at nuclear surface and the cluster yields in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Chiral three-nucleon forces for the new local position-space two-nucleon potential in $\textit{ab initio}$ many-body calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-nucleon force (3NF) plays an important role in understanding the structure of finite nuclei and the saturation properties of infinite nuclear matter. The chiral 3NF derived from the chiral effective field theory has been successful in $\textit{ab initio}$ studies of atomic nuclei. However, challenges remain, such as parameterizing low-energy constants and applying regulators. Most of established chiral nuclear forces have a nonlocal form in the momentum space. In this work, we construct local and hybrid local-nonlocal chiral 3NFs for the newly established Idaho local position-space two-nucleon potential, and calculate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{132}$Sn. The two low-energy constants of 3NF are constrained by the ground-state energies of $^3$H and $^{16}$O, as suggested in a recent work. The chiral Hamiltonian obtained with the local-nonlocal regulator can simultaneously reproduce the experimental ground-state energies and charge radii of nuclei over a large range from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn.</description>

      <title>Excluding Hypothetical Light Boson Interpretation of Yb King Plot Nonlinearity with the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ Isotope Shift Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present precision spectroscopy and isotope shift measurement of the ${}^1S_0 \leftrightarrow {}^3P_2$ clock transition in neutral ytterbium ($\mathrm{Yb}$) atoms. By revealing a magic wavelength at $905.4(2)$ nm, we successfully achieve the atomic spectrum narrower than $100$ Hz. The interleaved clock operation between isotopes allows us to determine isotope shifts of four bosonic isotope pairs at Hz-level uncertainties, which is combined with those of other four ultra-narrow transitions in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^+$ to construct the King plot. Importantly, the new isotope shift data reported in this work is a key to exclude the possibility of attributing the observed nonlinearity of the three-dimensional King plot solely to the new physics, while the previous works rely on the other terrestrial bound set by the neutron scattering and $(g-2)_e$ measurements. This work paves the way for the effective use of precision isotope shift data in the King plot analysis and stimulates further measurements in $\mathrm{Yb}$ and other elements.</description>

      <title>Commercial Accelerometers for Vibration Sensing at mK Temperatures in Dry Dilution Refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an evaluation of off-the-shelf commercial accelerometers at the mixing chamber stage of a cryogen-free dilution refrigerator at temperatures down to 8 mK. In addition, we present results of radioassay of accelerometer samples using a high purity germanium detector counting setup. Cryogen-free dilution refrigerators using pulse-tube cryocoolers (PTs)-due to recent advances in their cooling capacity, long-term stability, and operational costs-have become ubiquitous tools in a wide range of fields ranging from experimental particle physics to quantum information sciences. However, vibrations induced by PTs can negatively impact the experimental payload in these applications. This work demonstrates that commercially available accelerometers can not only measure vibrations at millikelvin cryogenic temperatures but also pave the way for continuous, in situ, real-time vibration monitoring of dry dilution refrigerators.</description>

      <title>Dielectron production in central Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurement of the e$^+$e$^-$ pair production at midrapidity and low invariant mass in central Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV at the LHC is presented. The yield of e$^+$e$^-$ pairs is compared with a cocktail of expected hadronic decay contributions in the invariant mass ($m_{\rm ee}$) and pair transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T,ee}$) ranges $m_{\rm ee} &lt; 3.5$ GeV$/c^2$ and $p_{\rm T,ee} &lt; 8$ GeV$/c$. For $0.18 &lt; m_{\rm ee} &lt; 0.5$ GeV$/c^2$ the ratio of data to the cocktail of hadronic contributions amounts to $1.40 \pm 0.11 \ ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.23 \ ({\rm syst.}) \pm 0.16 \ ({\rm cocktail})$ and $1.42 \pm 0.11 \ ({\rm stat.}) \pm 0.23 \ ({\rm syst.}) ^{+0.24}_{-0.29} \ ({\rm cocktail})$, including or not including medium effects in the estimation of the heavy-flavor background, respectively. It is consistent with predictions from two different models for an additional contribution of thermal e$^+$e$^-$ pairs from the hadronic and partonic phases. In the intermediate-mass range ($1.2 &lt; m_{\rm ee} &lt; 2.6$ GeV$/c^2$), the pair transverse impact parameter of the e$^+$e$^-$ pairs (DCA$_{\rm ee}$) is used for the first time in Pb$-$Pb collisions to separate displaced dielectrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays from a possible (thermal) contribution produced at the interaction point. The data are consistent with a suppression of e$^+$e$^-$ pairs from ${\rm c\overline{c}}$ and an additional prompt component. Finally, the first direct-photon measurement in the 10\% most central Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV is reported via the study of virtual direct photons in the transverse momentum range $1 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 5$ GeV$/c$. A model including prompt photons, as well as photons from the pre-equilibrium and fluid-dynamic phases, can reproduce the result, while being at the upper edge of the data uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Exclusive four pion photoproduction in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intense photon fluxes from relativistic nuclei provide an opportunity to study photonuclear interactions in ultraperipheral collisions. In particular, it allows for the investigations of excited, light-flavour vector mesons. The measurement of coherently photoproduced $ \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^-$ final states in ultraperipheral Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV is presented for the first time. The cross section, d$\sigma$/d$y$, times the branching ratio ($\rho\rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^-$) is found to be $47.8\pm2.3~\rm{(stat.)}\pm7.7~\rm{(syst.)}$ mb in the rapidity interval $|y| &lt; 0.5$. The invariant mass distribution is not well described with a single Breit-Wigner resonance without an interference term. Including interference with a non-resonant contribution results in the mass and width values being too far from those reported in PDG, while the production of two interfering resonances, $\rho(1450)$ and $\rho(1700)$, also provides a good description of the data. The values of the masses ($m$) and widths ($\Gamma$) of the resonances extracted from the fit assuming two interfering resonances are $m_{1}=1385\pm14~\rm{(stat.)}\pm3~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$, $\Gamma_{1}=431\pm36~\rm{(stat.)}\pm82~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$, $m_{2}=1663\pm13~\rm{(stat.)}\pm22~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$ and $\Gamma_{2}=357~\pm31~\rm{(stat.)}\pm49~\rm{(syst.)}$ MeV/$c^2$, respectively. The measured cross sections times the branching ratios are compared to recent theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: The coherent J/$\psi$ photoproduction cross section is measured for the first time at midrapidity in peripheral to semicentral Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV. The centrality differential cross section ${\rm d} \sigma/ {\rm d}y$ is reported for the centrality range 40-90%, together with the doubly-differential cross section ${\rm d}^2 \sigma /{\rm d}y {\rm d} p_{\rm T}$, extracted in two peripheral centrality classes. The J/$\psi$ mesons are reconstructed in the dielectron channel, in the rapidity interval $|y| &lt; 0.9$ using the ALICE central barrel detectors. The J/$\psi$ cross section at midrapidity is statistically compatible to the earlier ALICE measurement at forward rapidity and at the same centre-of-mass energy, and shows only a mild centrality dependence over the covered range. Several sets of theoretical calculations taking into account the hadronic overlap in the collisions but ignoring possible final-state effects from a hot expanding medium are found to give a fairly good description of the current measurements within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Investigating the p-$\pi^{\pm}$ and p-p-$\pi^{\pm}$ dynamics with femtoscopy in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between pions and nucleons plays a crucial role in hadron physics. It represents a fundamental building block of the low-energy QCD dynamics and is subject to several resonance excitations. This work studies the p-$\pi^{\pm}$ dynamics using femtoscopic correlations in high-multiplicity pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV measured by ALICE at the LHC. As the final-state interaction between protons and pions is well constrained by scattering experiments and the study of pionic hydrogen, the results give access to information on the particle-emitting source in pp collisions using the femtoscopy methods. The scaling of the source size of primordial protons and pions against their pair transverse mass is extracted. The results are compared with the source sizes studied with p$-$p, $\text{p--K}^+$, and $\pi^{\pm}$-$\pi^{\pm}$ pairs by ALICE in the same collision system and are found to be in agreement for the different particle pairs. This reinforces recent findings by ALICE of a common emission source for all hadron-pairs in pp collisions at LHC energies. Furthermore, the p-p-$\pi^{\pm}$ systems are studied using three-particle femtoscopy in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The presence of three-body effects is analyzed utilizing the cumulant expansion method. In this formalism, the known two-body interactions are subtracted in order to isolate the three-body effects. For both, p-p-$\pi^{+}$ and p-p-$\pi^{-}$, a non-zero cumulant is found, indicating effects beyond pairwise interactions. These results give information on the coupling of the pion to multiple nucleons.</description>

      <title>Measurement of correlations among net-charge, net-proton, and net-kaon multiplicity distributions in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations among conserved quantum numbers, such as the net-electric charge, the net-baryon, and the net-strangeness in heavy-ion collisions, are crucial for exploring the QCD phase diagram. In this paper, these correlations are investigated using net-proton number (as a proxy for the net-baryon), net-kaon number (for the net-strangeness), and net-charged particle number in Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector. The observed correlations deviate from the Poissonian baseline, with a more pronounced deviation at LHC energies than at RHIC. Theoretical calculations of the Thermal-FIST hadron resonance gas model, HIJING, and EPOS LHC event generators are compared with experimental results, where a significant impact of resonance decays is observed. Thermal-FIST calculations under the grand canonical and canonical ensembles highlight significant differences, underscoring the role of local charge conservation in explaining the data. Recent lattice QCD studies have demonstrated that the magnetic field generated by spectator protons in heavy-ion collisions affects susceptibility ratios, in particular those related to the net-electric charge and the net-baryon numbers. The experimental findings are in qualitative agreement with the expectations of lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Accessing the deuteron source with pion-deuteron femtoscopy in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV</title>

Abstract: Femtoscopy of non-identical particle pairs has been instrumental for precision measurements of both two-particle sources and the final-state interactions in high-energy elementary and heavy-ion collisions. The majority of measurements assessing the source properties are based on identical particle pairs, providing direct access to the characteristics of the single-particle source. The work in this paper demonstrates, via femtoscopy measurements of charged pion--deuteron pairs in Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, the feasibility of accessing the characteristics of the single-particle femtoscopic source by using particle pairs with large mass differences such as pions and deuterons. The first experimental results of the measurement of deuteron source sizes in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions are presented. The results show good agreement with the trend derived from other charged hadrons such as pions, kaons, and protons as a function of transverse mass, indicating similar source properties.</description>

      <title>Observation of coherent $\phi$(1020) meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first observation of coherent $\phi$(1020) meson photoproduction off heavy nuclei is presented using ultraperipheral lead-lead collisions at a center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair of 5.36 TeV. The data were collected by the CMS experiment and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 1.62 $\mu$b$^{-1}$. The $\phi$(1020) meson signals are reconstructed via the K$^+$K$^-$ decay channel. The production cross section is presented as a function of the $\phi$(1020) meson rapidity in the range 0.3 $\lt$ $\lvert y\rvert$ $\lt$ 1.0, probing gluons that carry a fraction of the nucleon momentum ($x$) around $10^{-4}$. The observed cross section exhibits little dependence on rapidity and is significantly suppressed, by a factor of ${\sim}$5, compared to a baseline model that treats a nucleus as a collection of free nucleons. Theoretical models that incorporate the nuclear shadowing effect generally provide a better description of the $\phi$(1020) data than those incorporating gluon saturation. This study establishes a powerful new tool for exploring nuclear effects and nuclear gluonic structure in the small-$x$ regime at a unique energy scale bridging the perturbative and nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics domains.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the proton-proton and proton-deuteron systems in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work reports femtoscopic correlations of p$-$p ($\bar{\rm p}-\bar{\rm p}$) and p$-$d ($\bar{\rm p}-\bar{\rm d}$) pairs measured in Pb$-$Pb collisions at center-of-mass energy per nucleon $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV in the ALICE Collaboration. A fit to the measured proton-proton correlation functions allows one to extract the dependence of the nucleon femtoscopic radius of the particle-emitting source on the pair transverse mass ($m_\text{T}$) and on the average charge particle multiplicity $\langle\text{dN}_\text{ch}/\text{d}\eta\rangle^{1/3}$ for three centrality intervals (0$-$10$\%$, 10$-$30$\%$, 30$-$50$\%$). In both cases, the expected power-law and linear scalings are observed, respectively. The measured p$-$d correlations can be described by both two- and three-body calculations, indicating that the femtoscopy observable is not sensitive to the short-distance features of the dynamics of the p$-$(p$-$n) system, due to the large inter-particle distances in Pb$-$Pb collisions at the LHC. Indeed, in this study, the minimum measured femtoscopic source sizes for protons and deuterons have a minimum value at $2.73^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ and $3.10^{+1.04}_{-0.86}$ fm, respectively, for the 30$-$50$\%$ centrality collisions. Moreover, the $m_{\rm{T}}$-scaling obtained for the p$-$p and p$-$d systems is compatible within 1$\sigma$ of the uncertainties. These findings provide new input for fundamental studies on the production of light (anti)nuclei under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Study of $\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ and its higher moments, and extraction of the speed of sound in Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE</title>

Abstract: Ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions produce a state of hot and dense strongly interacting QCD matter called quark--gluon plasma (QGP). On an event-by-event basis, the volume of the QGP in ultracentral collisions is mostly constant, while its total entropy can vary significantly due to quantum fluctuations, leading to variations in the temperature of the system. Exploiting this unique feature of ultracentral collisions allows for the interpretation of the correlation of the mean transverse momentum of produced charged hadrons and the number of charged hadrons as a measure for the speed of sound. It is determined by fitting the relative increase in transverse momentum with respect to the relative change in the average charged-particle density measured at midrapidity. This study reports the event-average transverse momentum of charged particles as well as the self-normalized variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the event-by-event transverse momentum distribution in ultracentral Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV per nucleon pair using the ALICE detector. Different centrality estimators based on charged-particle multiplicity or the transverse energy of the event are used to select ultracentral collisions. By ensuring a pseudorapidity gap between the region used to define the centrality and the region used to perform the measurement, the influence of biases on the rise of the mean transverse momentum is tested. The measured values are found to strongly depend on the exploited centrality estimator. The variance shows a steep decrease towards ultracentral collisions, while the skewness variables show a maximum, followed by a fast decrease. These non-Gaussian features are understood in terms of the vanishing of the impact-parameter fluctuations contributing to the event-to-event transverse momentum distribution.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of $\Xi_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurement at midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.5$) of the production yield of the strange-charm baryons $\Xi_c^+$ and $\Xi_c^0$ as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) in different charged-particle multiplicity classes in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ALICE experiment at the LHC is reported. The $\Xi_c^+$ baryon is reconstructed via the $\Xi_c^+ \rightarrow \Xi^-\pi^+\pi^+$ decay channel in the range $4 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 12$ GeV/$c$, while the $\Xi_c^0$ baryon is reconstructed via both the $\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-\pi^+$ and $\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-e^+\nu_e$ decay channels in the range $2 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 12$ GeV/$c$. The baryon-to-meson ($\Xi_c^{0,+}/{\rm D}^0$) and the baryon-to-baryon ($\Xi_c^{0,+}/\Lambda_{\rm c}^+$) production yield ratios show no significant dependence on multiplicity. In addition, the observed yield ratios are not described by theoretical predictions that model charm-quark fragmentation based on measurements at $e^+e^-$ and $e^-$p colliders, indicating differences in the charm-baryon production mechanism in pp collisions. A comparison with different event generators and tunings, including different modelling of the hadronisation process, is also discussed. Moreover, the branching-fraction ratio of BR($\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-e^+\nu_e$)/BR($\Xi_c^0 \rightarrow \Xi^-\pi^+$) is measured as 0.825 $\pm$ 0.094 (stat.) $\pm$ 0.081 (syst.). This value supersedes the previous ALICE measurement, improving the statistical precision by a factor of 1.6.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strong isovector nuclear spin-orbit interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nucleon spin-orbit interaction is a cornerstone of nuclear structure theory, yet its isospin dependence remains elusive owing to the lack of clean experimental probes. Here we show that the charge-weak form factor difference in $^{48}$Ca, recently extracted in a model-independent manner by the CREX experiment, exhibits strong sensitivity to the isovector spin-orbit interaction. Using Skyrme-like energy density functionals, we demonstrate that a significantly enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction, about four times stronger than conventional parametrizations, can resolve the PREX-CREX puzzle, which has challenged modern nuclear theories and our understanding of nuclear symmetry energy, while maintaining a good description of nuclear bulk properties and well-established shell structure of finite nuclei. This enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of the $N = 14$, $16$, $32$ and $34$ magic numbers in neutron-rich nuclei on the mean-field level. These findings point to a strong isospin dependence of the nucleon spin-orbit interaction, which is expected to have important implications for nuclear structures, electroweak nuclear processes, and related problems in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\nu$-dependence of projected energy correlators in HICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently derived factorization formula for energy-energy correlators to study the analytic structure of general $\nu$-point projected energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. The $\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\sim 1/\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\nu&lt;1$, medium-induced jet function is enhanced compared to $\nu&gt;1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\nu&lt;1$ when compared to large $\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\nu$ values, the $\nu$-correlators appear to saturate at $\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical computations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level production cross-section. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the effect of BFKL resummation for various values of $\nu$.</description>

      <title>D$^{0}$-meson-tagged jet axes difference in proton-proton collisions at $\mathbf{\sqrt{\textit{s}} = 5.02}$ TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heavy-flavor quarks produced in proton--proton (pp) collisions provide a unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of quark-initiated parton showers from initial hard scatterings to final-state hadrons. By examining jets that contain heavy-flavor hadrons, this study explores the effects of both perturbative and non-perturbative QCD on jet formation and structure. The angular differences between various jet axes, $\Delta R_{\rm axis}$, offer insight into the radiation patterns and fragmentation of charm quarks. The first measurement of D$^{0}$-tagged jet axes differences in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV by the ALICE experiment at the LHC is presented for jets with transverse momentum $p_{\rm T}^{\rm ch~jet} \geq 10$ ${\rm GeV}/c$ and D$^0$ mesons with $p_{\rm T}^{\rm D^{0}} \geq 5$ ${\rm GeV}/c$. In this D$^0$-meson-tagged jet measurement, three jet axis definitions, each with different sensitivities to soft, wide-angle radiation, are used: the Standard axis, Soft Drop groomed axis, and Winner-Takes-All axis. Measurements of the radial distributions of D$^0$ mesons with respect to the jet axes, $\Delta R_{\mathrm{axis-D^0}}$, are reported, along with the angle, $\Delta R_{\mathrm{axis}}$, between the three jet axes. The D$^{0}$ meson emerges as the leading particle in these jets, closely aligning with the Winner-Takes-All axis and diverging from the Standard jet axis. The results also examine how varying the sensitivity to soft radiation with grooming influences the orientation of the Soft Drop jet axis, and uncover that charm-jet structure is more likely to survive grooming when the Soft Drop axis is further from the D$^{0}$ direction, providing further evidence of the dead-cone effect recently measured by ALICE.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Star Properties from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to constrain NS radii with uncertainties as small as $\sigma \simeq 0.1$~km. Such unprecedented precision offers a unique opportunity to extract new information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Using mock radius data with uncertainties ranging from $\sigma = 1.0$ to $0.1$~km, together with a flexible meta-model NS EOS that allows for a first-order hadron-quark phase transition, we perform a Bayesian statistical analysis to assess the impact of radius measurements on EOS constraints. We find that high-precision radius measurements, particularly for massive NSs, significantly tighten constraints on the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, the quark matter mass fraction in NS cores, and several parameters characterizing the EOS of supranuclear hadronic matter, although the degree of improvement depends on the assumed prior range of $\rho_t$. In contrast, even with the highest precision considered, NS radii -- including those of massive stars -- remain largely insensitive to the stiffness of quark matter, independent of the measurement accuracy or the prior range adopted for $\rho_t$.</description>

      <title>Two-proton emission as source of spin-entangled proton pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a two-proton emitter with a diproton-correlated initial state can act as a source of spin-correlated proton pairs. Using a time-dependent three-body model, we investigate the two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne ($^{14}$O$+2p$) and analyze the spin correlation of the emitted protons. We find that, when the emission proceeds as a democratic three-body process from an initial state containing a spin-singlet diproton correlation, the emitted protons exhibit a pronounced spin-correlation pattern exceeding the local-hidden-variable bound. This spin correlation closely resembles that of a pure spin-singlet pair. In contrast, this pattern is lost when the process is dominated by the sequential emission or when the initial diproton correlation is absent. These results demonstrate that a certain class of two-proton emitters can deliver spin-entangled proton pairs, and their spin correlation reflects the diproton correlation embedded in the initial state.</description>
