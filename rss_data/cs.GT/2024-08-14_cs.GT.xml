      <title>Distributed Stackelberg Strategies in State-based Potential Games for Autonomous Decentralized Learning Manufacturing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes a novel game structure for autonomously optimizing decentralized manufacturing systems with multi-objective optimization challenges, namely Distributed Stackelberg Strategies in State-Based Potential Games (DS2-SbPG). DS2-SbPG integrates potential games and Stackelberg games, which improves the cooperative trade-off capabilities of potential games and the multi-objective optimization handling by Stackelberg games. Notably, all training procedures remain conducted in a fully distributed manner. DS2-SbPG offers a promising solution to finding optimal trade-offs between objectives by eliminating the complexities of setting up combined objective optimization functions for individual players in self-learning domains, particularly in real-world industrial settings with diverse and numerous objectives between the sub-systems. We further prove that DS2-SbPG constitutes a dynamic potential game that results in corresponding converge guarantees. Experimental validation conducted on a laboratory-scale testbed highlights the efficacy of DS2-SbPG and its two variants, such as DS2-SbPG for single-leader-follower and Stack DS2-SbPG for multi-leader-follower. The results show significant reductions in power consumption and improvements in overall performance, which signals the potential of DS2-SbPG in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Clock Auctions Augmented with Unreliable Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the first analysis of clock auctions through the learning-augmented framework. Deferred-acceptance clock auctions are a compelling class of mechanisms satisfying a unique list of highly practical properties, including obvious strategy-proofness, transparency, and unconditional winner privacy, making them particularly well-suited for real-world applications. However, early work that evaluated their performance from a worst-case analysis standpoint concluded that no deterministic clock auction can achieve much better than an $O(\log n)$ approximation of the optimal social welfare (where $n$ is the number of bidders participating in the auction), even in seemingly very simple settings.
  To overcome this overly pessimistic impossibility result, which heavily depends on the assumption that the designer has no information regarding the preferences of the participating bidders, we leverage the learning-augmented framework. This framework assumes that the designer is provided with some advice regarding what the optimal solution may be. This advice may be the product of machine-learning algorithms applied to historical data, so it can provide very useful guidance, but it can also be highly unreliable.
  Our main results are learning-augmented clock auctions that use this advice to achieve much stronger performance guarantees whenever the advice is accurate (known as consistency), while simultaneously maintaining worst-case guarantees even if this advice is arbitrarily inaccurate (known as robustness). Specifically, for the standard notion of consistency, we provide a clock auction that achieves the best of both worlds: $(1+\epsilon)$-consistency for any constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and $O(\log n)$ robustness. We then also consider a much stronger notion of consistency and provide an auction that achieves the optimal trade-off between this notion of consistency and robustness.</description>

      <title>Margin of Victory for Weighted Tournament Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining how close a winner of an election is to becoming a loser, or distinguishing between different possible winners of an election, are major problems in computational social choice. We tackle these problems for so-called weighted tournament solutions by generalizing the notion of margin of victory (MoV) for tournament solutions by Brill et. al to weighted tournament solutions. For these, the MoV of a winner (resp. loser) is the total weight that needs to be changed in the tournament to make them a loser (resp. winner). We study three weighted tournament solutions: Borda's rule, the weighted Uncovered Set, and Split Cycle. For all three rules, we determine whether the MoV for winners and non-winners is tractable and give upper and lower bounds on the possible values of the MoV. Further, we axiomatically study and generalize properties from the unweighted tournament setting to weighted tournaments.</description>
