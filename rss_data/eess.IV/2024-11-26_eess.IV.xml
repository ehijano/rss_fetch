      <title>Using Spatial Diffusions for Optoacoustic Tomography Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optoacoustic tomography image reconstruction has been a problem of interest in recent years. By exploiting the exceptional generative power of the recently proposed diffusion models we consider a scheme which is based on a conditional diffusion process. Using a simple initial image reconstruction method such as Delay and Sum, we consider a specially designed autoencoder architecture which generates a latent representation which is used as conditional information in the generative diffusion process. Numerical results show the merits of our proposal in terms of quality metrics such as PSNR and SSIM, showing that the conditional information generated in terms of the initial reconstructed image is able to bias the generative process of the diffusion model in order to enhance the image, correct artifacts and even recover some finer details that the initial reconstruction method is not able to obtain.</description>

      <title>Improving the Test-retest Reliability of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation - The test-retest reliability of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is affected by parameters of the acquisition protocol such as the angulation of acquisition plane with respect to the B0 field direction and spatial resolution.
  Goal - We aim to reduce the protocol-dependent biases/errors that might overshadow subtle changes of the susceptibility values due to pathology in the brain.
  Approach - The magnitude and phase images used for QSM are registered according to a standard reference protocol in the k-space through nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT).
  Results - With the help of our proposed approach, the test-retest reliability of scans acquired from different protocols is notably improved.
  Impact - The improved test-retest reliability of QSM makes it easier to detect subtle susceptibility changes in the early stages of neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.</description>

      <title>Learning Volumetric Neural Deformable Models to Recover 3D Regional Heart Wall Motion from Multi-Planar Tagged MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-planar tagged MRI is the gold standard for regional heart wall motion evaluation. However, accurate recovery of the 3D true heart wall motion from a set of 2D apparent motion cues is challenging, due to incomplete sampling of the true motion and difficulty in information fusion from apparent motion cues observed on multiple imaging planes. To solve these challenges, we introduce a novel class of volumetric neural deformable models ($\upsilon$NDMs). Our $\upsilon$NDMs represent heart wall geometry and motion through a set of low-dimensional global deformation parameter functions and a diffeomorphic point flow regularized local deformation field. To learn such global and local deformation for 2D apparent motion mapping to 3D true motion, we design a hybrid point transformer, which incorporates both point cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms. While use of point cross-attention can learn to fuse 2D apparent motion cues into material point true motion hints, point self-attention hierarchically organised as an encoder-decoder structure can further learn to refine these hints and map them into 3D true motion. We have performed experiments on a large cohort of synthetic 3D regional heart wall motion dataset. The results demonstrated the high accuracy of our method for the recovery of dense 3D true motion from sparse 2D apparent motion cues.

      <title>J-Invariant Volume Shuffle for Self-Supervised Cryo-Electron Tomogram Denoising on Single Noisy Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) enables detailed 3D visualization of cellular structures in near-native states but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio due to imaging constraints. Traditional denoising methods and supervised learning approaches often struggle with complex noise patterns and the lack of paired datasets. Self-supervised methods, which utilize noisy input itself as a target, have been studied; however, existing Cryo-ET self-supervised denoising methods face significant challenges due to losing information during training and the learned incomplete noise patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised learning model that denoises Cryo-ET volumetric images using a single noisy volume. Our method features a U-shape J-invariant blind spot network with sparse centrally masked convolutions, dilated channel attention blocks, and volume unshuffle/shuffle technique. The volume-unshuffle/shuffle technique expands receptive fields and utilizes multi-scale representations, significantly improving noise reduction and structural preservation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, advancing Cryo-ET data processing for structural biology research</description>

      <title>Optimized Vessel Segmentation: A Structure-Agnostic Approach with Small Vessel Enhancement and Morphological Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of blood vessels is essential for various clinical assessments and postoperative analyses. However, the inherent challenges of vascular imaging, such as sparsity, fine granularity, low contrast, data distribution variability, and the critical need for preserving topological structure, making generalized vessel segmentation particularly complex. While specialized segmentation methods have been developed for specific anatomical regions, their over-reliance on tailored models hinders broader applicability and generalization. General-purpose segmentation models introduced in medical imaging often fail to address critical vascular characteristics, including the connectivity of segmentation results. To overcome these limitations, we propose an optimized vessel segmentation framework: a structure-agnostic approach incorporating small vessel enhancement and morphological correction for multi-modality vessel segmentation. To train and validate this framework, we compiled a comprehensive multi-modality dataset spanning 17 datasets and benchmarked our model against six SAM-based methods and 17 expert models. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy, generalization, and a 34.6% improvement in connectivity, underscoring its clinical potential. An ablation study further validates the effectiveness of the proposed improvements. We will release the code and dataset at github following the publication of this work.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Osteoporosis Diagnosis Using Singh Index Clustering on Hip Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Osteoporosis, a prevalent condition among the aging population worldwide, is characterized by diminished bone mass and altered bone structure, increasing susceptibility to fractures. It poses a significant and growing global public health challenge over the next decade. Diagnosis typically involves Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure bone mineral density, yet its mass screening utility is limited. The Singh Index (SI) provides a straightforward, semi-quantitative means of osteoporosis diagnosis through plain hip radiographs, assessing trabecular patterns in the proximal femur. Although cost-effective and accessible, manual SI calculation is time-intensive and requires expertise. This study aims to automate SI identification from radiographs using machine learning algorithms. An unlabelled dataset of 838 hip X-ray images from Indian adults aged 20-70 was utilized. A custom convolutional neural network architecture was developed for feature extraction, demonstrating superior performance in cluster homogeneity and heterogeneity compared to established models. Various clustering algorithms categorized images into six SI grade clusters, with comparative analysis revealing only two clusters with high Silhouette Scores for promising classification. Further scrutiny highlighted dataset imbalance and emphasized the importance of image quality and additional clinical data availability. The study suggests augmenting X-ray images with patient clinical data and reference images, alongside image pre-processing techniques, to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, exploring semi-supervised and self-supervised learning methods may mitigate labelling challenges associated with large datasets.</description>

      <title>OSMamba: Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba with Dual-Domain Prior Generator for Exposure Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exposure correction is a fundamental problem in computer vision and image processing. Recently, frequency domain-based methods have achieved impressive improvement, yet they still struggle with complex real-world scenarios under extreme exposure conditions. This is due to the local convolutional receptive fields failing to model long-range dependencies in the spectrum, and the non-generative learning paradigm being inadequate for retrieving lost details from severely degraded regions. In this paper, we propose Omnidirectional Spectral Mamba (OSMamba), a novel exposure correction network that incorporates the advantages of state space models and generative diffusion models to address these limitations. Specifically, OSMamba introduces an omnidirectional spectral scanning mechanism that adapts Mamba to the frequency domain to capture comprehensive long-range dependencies in both the amplitude and phase spectra of deep image features, hence enhancing illumination correction and structure recovery. Furthermore, we develop a dual-domain prior generator that learns from well-exposed images to generate a degradation-free diffusion prior containing correct information about severely under- and over-exposed regions for better detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple-exposure and mixed-exposure datasets demonstrate that the proposed OSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.</description>

      <title>MambaIRv2: Attentive State Space Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mamba-based image restoration backbones have recently demonstrated significant potential in balancing global reception and computational efficiency. However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by \textbf{even 0.35dB} PSNR for lightweight SR even with \textbf{9.3\% less} parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by \textbf{up to 0.29dB}.

      <title>Feature-interactive Siamese graph encoder-based image analysis to predict STAS from histopathology images in lung cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spread through air spaces (STAS) is a distinct invasion pattern in lung cancer, crucial for prognosis assessment and guiding surgical decisions. Histopathology is the gold standard for STAS detection, yet traditional methods are subjective, time-consuming, and prone to misdiagnosis, limiting large-scale applications. We present VERN, an image analysis model utilizing a feature-interactive Siamese graph encoder to predict STAS from lung cancer histopathological images. VERN captures spatial topological features with feature sharing and skip connections to enhance model training. Using 1,546 histopathology slides, we built a large single-cohort STAS lung cancer dataset. VERN achieved an AUC of 0.9215 in internal validation and AUCs of 0.8275 and 0.8829 in frozen and paraffin-embedded test sections, respectively, demonstrating clinical-grade performance. Validated on a single-cohort and three external datasets, VERN showed robust predictive performance and generalizability, providing an open platform (http://plr.20210706.xyz:5000/) to enhance STAS diagnosis efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Temporal Normalization Module for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) extracts PPG signals from subtle color changes in facial videos, showing strong potential for health applications. However, most rPPG methods rely on intensity differences between consecutive frames, missing long-term signal variations affected by motion or lighting artifacts, which reduces accuracy. This paper introduces Temporal Normalization (TN), a flexible plug-and-play module compatible with any end-to-end rPPG network architecture. By capturing long-term temporally normalized features following detrending, TN effectively mitigates motion and lighting artifacts, significantly boosting the rPPG prediction performance. When integrated into four state-of-the-art rPPG methods, TN delivered performance improvements ranging from 34.3% to 94.2% in heart rate measurement tasks across four widely-used datasets. Notably, TN showed even greater performance gains in smaller models. We further discuss and provide insights into the mechanisms behind TN's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Guided Posterior Sampling for Diffusion-Based Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover high-quality images from degraded observations. When the degradation process is known, the recovery problem can be formulated as an inverse problem, and in a Bayesian context, the goal is to sample a clean reconstruction given the degraded observation. Recently, modern pretrained diffusion models have been used for image restoration by modifying their sampling procedure to account for the degradation process. However, these methods often rely on certain approximations that can lead to significant errors and compromised sample quality. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of this approximation error for linear inverse problems under distributional assumptions on the space of natural images, demonstrating cases where previous works can fail dramatically. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we propose a simple modification to existing diffusion-based restoration methods. Our approach introduces a time-varying low-pass filter in the frequency domain of the measurements, progressively incorporating higher frequencies during the restoration process. We develop an adaptive curriculum for this frequency schedule based on the underlying data distribution. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging image restoration tasks including motion deblurring and image dehazing.</description>

      <title>Improved Background Estimation for Gas Plume Identification in Hyperspectral Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longwave infrared (LWIR) hyperspectral imaging can be used for many tasks in remote sensing, including detecting and identifying effluent gases by LWIR sensors on airborne platforms. Once a potential plume has been detected, it needs to be identified to determine exactly what gas or gases are present in the plume. During identification, the background underneath the plume needs to be estimated and removed to reveal the spectral characteristics of the gas of interest. Current standard practice is to use ``global" background estimation, where the average of all non-plume pixels is used to estimate the background for each pixel in the plume. However, if this global background estimate does not model the true background under the plume well, then the resulting signal can be difficult to identify correctly. The importance of proper background estimation increases when dealing with weak signals, large libraries of gases of interest, and with uncommon or heterogeneous backgrounds. In this paper, we propose two methods of background estimation, in addition to three existing methods, and compare each against global background estimation to determine which perform best at estimating the true background radiance under a plume, and for increasing identification confidence using a neural network classification model. We compare the different methods using 640 simulated plumes. We find that PCA is best at estimating the true background under a plume, with a median of 18,000 times less MSE compared to global background estimation. Our proposed K-Nearest Segments algorithm improves median neural network identification confidence by 53.2%.</description>

      <title>SPA: Efficient User-Preference Alignment against Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation data inherently contain uncertainty, often stemming from both imperfect image quality and variability in labeling preferences on ambiguous pixels, which depend on annotators' expertise and the clinical context of the annotations. For instance, a boundary pixel might be labeled as tumor in diagnosis to avoid under-assessment of severity, but as normal tissue in radiotherapy to prevent damage to sensitive structures. As segmentation preferences vary across downstream applications, it is often desirable for an image segmentation model to offer user-adaptable predictions rather than a fixed output. While prior uncertainty-aware and interactive methods offer adaptability, they are inefficient at test time: uncertainty-aware models require users to choose from numerous similar outputs, while interactive models demand significant user input through click or box prompts to refine segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{SPA}, a segmentation framework that efficiently adapts to diverse test-time preferences with minimal human interaction. By presenting users a select few, distinct segmentation candidates that best capture uncertainties, it reduces clinician workload in reaching the preferred segmentation. To accommodate user preference, we introduce a probabilistic mechanism that leverages user feedback to adapt model's segmentation preference. The proposed framework is evaluated on a diverse range of medical image segmentation tasks: color fundus images, CT, and MRI. It demonstrates 1) a significant reduction in clinician time and effort compared with existing interactive segmentation approaches, 2) strong adaptability based on human feedback, and 3) state-of-the-art image segmentation performance across diverse modalities and semantic labels.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Cascaded Large-Model for Whole-body ROI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organs-at-risk segmentation is critical for ensuring the safety and precision of radiotherapy and surgical procedures. However, existing methods for organs-at-risk image segmentation often suffer from uncertainties and biases in target selection, as well as insufficient model validation experiments, limiting their generality and reliability in practical applications. To address these issues, we propose an innovative cascaded network architecture called the Multi-scale Cascaded Fusing Network (MCFNet), which effectively captures complex multi-scale and multi-resolution features. MCFNet includes a Sharp Extraction Backbone and a Flexible Connection Backbone, which respectively enhance feature extraction in the downsampling and skip-connection stages. This design not only improves segmentation accuracy but also ensures computational efficiency, enabling precise detail capture even in low-resolution images. We conduct experiments using the A6000 GPU on diverse datasets from 671 patients, including 36,131 image-mask pairs across 10 different datasets. MCFNet demonstrates strong robustness, performing consistently well across 10 datasets. Additionally, MCFNet exhibits excellent generalizability, maintaining high accuracy in different clinical scenarios. We also introduce an adaptive loss aggregation strategy to further optimize the model training process, improving both segmentation accuracy and efficiency. Through extensive validation, MCFNet demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods, providing more reliable image-guided support.

      <title>MulModSeg: Enhancing Unpaired Multi-Modal Medical Image Segmentation with Modality-Conditioned Text Embedding and Alternating Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the diverse field of medical imaging, automatic segmentation has numerous applications and must handle a wide variety of input domains, such as different types of Computed Tomography (CT) scans and Magnetic Resonance (MR) images. This heterogeneity challenges automatic segmentation algorithms to maintain consistent performance across different modalities due to the requirement for spatially aligned and paired images. Typically, segmentation models are trained using a single modality, which limits their ability to generalize to other types of input data without employing transfer learning techniques. Additionally, leveraging complementary information from different modalities to enhance segmentation precision often necessitates substantial modifications to popular encoder-decoder designs, such as introducing multiple branched encoding or decoding paths for each modality. In this work, we propose a simple Multi-Modal Segmentation (MulModSeg) strategy to enhance medical image segmentation across multiple modalities, specifically CT and MR. It incorporates two key designs: a modality-conditioned text embedding framework via a frozen text encoder that adds modality awareness to existing segmentation frameworks without significant structural modifications or computational overhead, and an alternating training procedure that facilitates the integration of essential features from unpaired CT and MR inputs. Through extensive experiments with both Fully Convolutional Network and Transformer-based backbones, MulModSeg consistently outperforms previous methods in segmenting abdominal multi-organ and cardiac substructures for both CT and MR modalities.

      <title>Classifier Enhanced Deep Learning Model for Erythroblast Differentiation with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15592v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematological disorders, which involve a variety of malignant conditions and genetic diseases affecting blood formation, present significant diagnostic challenges. One such major challenge in clinical settings is differentiating Erythroblast from WBCs. Our approach evaluates the efficacy of various machine learning (ML) classifiers$\unicode{x2014}$SVM, XG-Boost, KNN, and Random Forest$\unicode{x2014}$using the ResNet-50 deep learning model as a backbone in detecting and differentiating erythroblast blood smear images across training splits of different sizes. Our findings indicate that the ResNet50-SVM classifier consistently surpasses other models' overall test accuracy and erythroblast detection accuracy, maintaining high performance even with minimal training data. Even when trained on just 1% (168 images per class for eight classes) of the complete dataset, ML classifiers such as SVM achieved a test accuracy of 86.75% and an erythroblast precision of 98.9%, compared to 82.03% and 98.6% of pre-trained ResNet-50 models without any classifiers. When limited data is available, the proposed approach outperforms traditional deep learning models, thereby offering a solution for achieving higher classification accuracy for small and unique datasets, especially in resource-scarce settings.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Resource-Efficient CNN Architectures for Brain Tumor Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification in MRI images is critical for timely diagnosis and treatment planning. While deep learning models like ResNet-18, VGG-16 have shown high accuracy, they often come with increased complexity and computational demands. This study presents a comparative analysis of effective yet simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and pre-trained ResNet18, and VGG16 model for brain tumor classification using two publicly available datasets: Br35H:: Brain Tumor Detection 2020 and Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. The custom CNN architecture, despite its lower complexity, demonstrates competitive performance with the pre-trained ResNet18 and VGG16 models. In binary classification tasks, the custom CNN achieved an accuracy of 98.67% on the Br35H dataset and 99.62% on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. For multi-class classification, the custom CNN, with a slight architectural modification, achieved an accuracy of 98.09%, on the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset. Comparatively, ResNet18 and VGG16 maintained high performance levels, but the custom CNNs provided a more computationally efficient alternative. Additionally,the custom CNNs were evaluated using few-shot learning (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 40, and 80 shots) to assess their robustness, achieving notable accuracy improvements with increased shots. This study highlights the potential of well-designed, less complex CNN architectures as effective and computationally efficient alternatives to deeper, pre-trained models for medical imaging tasks, including brain tumor classification. This study underscores the potential of custom CNNs in medical imaging tasks and encourages further exploration in this direction.</description>

      <title>Machine-agnostic Automated Lumbar MRI Segmentation using a Cascaded Model Based on Generative Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated lumbar spine segmentation is very crucial for modern diagnosis systems. In this study, we introduce a novel machine-agnostic approach for segmenting lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral discs from MRI images, employing a cascaded model that synergizes an ROI detection and a Self-organized Operational Neural Network (Self-ONN)-based encoder-decoder network for segmentation. Addressing the challenge of diverse MRI modalities, our methodology capitalizes on a unique dataset comprising images from 12 scanners and 34 subjects, enhanced through strategic preprocessing and data augmentation techniques. The YOLOv8 medium model excels in ROI extraction, achieving an excellent performance of 0.916 mAP score. Significantly, our Self-ONN-based model, combined with a DenseNet121 encoder, demonstrates excellent performance in lumbar vertebrae and IVD segmentation with a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 83.66%, a sensitivity of 91.44%, and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 91.03%, as validated through rigorous 10-fold cross-validation. This study not only showcases an effective approach to MRI segmentation in spine-related disorders but also sets the stage for future advancements in automated diagnostic tools, emphasizing the need for further dataset expansion and model refinement for broader clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Diffusion Generative Models in Computational Pathology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Generative Models (DGM) have rapidly surfaced as emerging topics in the field of computer vision, garnering significant interest across a wide array of deep learning applications. Despite their high computational demand, these models are extensively utilized for their superior sample quality and robust mode coverage. While research in diffusion generative models is advancing, exploration within the domain of computational pathology and its large-scale datasets has been comparatively gradual. Bridging the gap between the high-quality generation capabilities of Diffusion Generative Models and the intricate nature of pathology data, this paper presents an in-depth comparative analysis of diffusion methods applied to a pathology dataset. Our analysis extends to datasets with varying Fields of View (FOV), revealing that DGMs are highly effective in producing high-quality synthetic data. An ablative study is also conducted, followed by a detailed discussion on the impact of various methods on the synthesized histopathology images. One striking observation from our experiments is how the adjustment of image size during data generation can simulate varying fields of view. These findings underscore the potential of DGMs to enhance the quality and diversity of synthetic pathology data, especially when used with real data, ultimately increasing accuracy of deep learning models in histopathology.

      <title>Enhancing the automatic segmentation and analysis of 3D liver vasculature models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surgical assessment of liver cancer patients requires identification of the vessel trees from medical images. Specifically, the venous trees - the portal (perfusing) and the hepatic (draining) trees are important for understanding the liver anatomy and disease state, and perform surgery planning. This research aims to improve the 3D segmentation, skeletonization, and subsequent analysis of vessel trees, by creating an automatic pipeline based on deep learning and image processing techniques.
  The first part of this work explores the impact of differentiable skeletonization methods such as ClDice and morphological skeletonization loss, on the overall liver vessel segmentation performance. To this aim, it studies how to improve vessel tree connectivity.
  The second part of this study converts a single class vessel segmentation into multi-class ones, separating the two venous trees. It builds on the previous two-class vessel segmentation model, which vessel tree outputs might be entangled, and on connected components and skeleton analyses of the trees.
  After providing sub-labeling of the specific anatomical branches of each venous tree, these algorithms also enable a morphometric analysis of the vessel trees by extracting various geometrical markers.
  In conclusion, we propose a method that successfully improves current skeletonization methods, for extensive vascular trees that contain vessels of different calibers. The separation algorithm creates a clean multi-class segmentation of the vessels, validated by surgeons to provide low error. A new, publicly shared high-quality liver vessel dataset of 77 cases is thus created. Finally a method to annotate vessel trees according to anatomy is provided, enabling a unique liver vessel morphometry analysis.</description>

      <title>M3-CVC: Controllable Video Compression with Multimodal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional and neural video codecs commonly encounter limitations in controllability and generality under ultra-low-bitrate coding scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose M3-CVC, a controllable video compression framework incorporating multimodal generative models. The framework utilizes a semantic-motion composite strategy for keyframe selection to retain critical information. For each keyframe and its corresponding video clip, a dialogue-based large multimodal model (LMM) approach extracts hierarchical spatiotemporal details, enabling both inter-frame and intra-frame representations for improved video fidelity while enhancing encoding interpretability. M3-CVC further employs a conditional diffusion-based, text-guided keyframe compression method, achieving high fidelity in frame reconstruction. During decoding, textual descriptions derived from LMMs guide the diffusion process to restore the original video's content accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that M3-CVC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VVC standard in ultra-low bitrate scenarios, particularly in preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Medical Slice Transformer: Improved Diagnosis and Explainability on 3D Medical Images with DINOv2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MRI and CT are essential clinical cross-sectional imaging techniques for diagnosing complex conditions. However, large 3D datasets with annotations for deep learning are scarce. While methods like DINOv2 are encouraging for 2D image analysis, these methods have not been applied to 3D medical images. Furthermore, deep learning models often lack explainability due to their "black-box" nature. This study aims to extend 2D self-supervised models, specifically DINOv2, to 3D medical imaging while evaluating their potential for explainable outcomes. We introduce the Medical Slice Transformer (MST) framework to adapt 2D self-supervised models for 3D medical image analysis. MST combines a Transformer architecture with a 2D feature extractor, i.e., DINOv2. We evaluate its diagnostic performance against a 3D convolutional neural network (3D ResNet) across three clinical datasets: breast MRI (651 patients), chest CT (722 patients), and knee MRI (1199 patients). Both methods were tested for diagnosing breast cancer, predicting lung nodule dignity, and detecting meniscus tears. Diagnostic performance was assessed by calculating the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). Explainability was evaluated through a radiologist's qualitative comparison of saliency maps based on slice and lesion correctness. P-values were calculated using Delong's test. MST achieved higher AUC values compared to ResNet across all three datasets: breast (0.94$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.91$\pm$0.02, P=0.02), chest (0.95$\pm$0.01 vs. 0.92$\pm$0.02, P=0.13), and knee (0.85$\pm$0.04 vs. 0.69$\pm$0.05, P=0.001). Saliency maps were consistently more precise and anatomically correct for MST than for ResNet. Self-supervised 2D models like DINOv2 can be effectively adapted for 3D medical imaging using MST, offering enhanced diagnostic accuracy and explainability compared to convolutional neural networks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Data Augmentation Tool for Enhancing Machine Learning Classification: A New Application of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Improved Cardiac Disease Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a data-driven, modal decomposition method, the higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), is combined with a convolutional neural network (CNN) in order to improve the classification accuracy of several cardiac diseases using echocardiography images. The HODMD algorithm is used first as feature extraction technique for the echocardiography datasets, taken from both healthy mice and mice afflicted by different cardiac diseases (Diabetic Cardiomyopathy, Obesity, TAC Hypertrophy and Myocardial Infarction). A total number of 130 echocardiography datasets are used in this work. The dominant features related to each cardiac disease were identified and represented by the HODMD algorithm as a set of DMD modes, which then are used as the input to the CNN. In a way, the database dimension was augmented, hence HODMD has been used, for the first time to the authors knowledge, for data augmentation in the machine learning framework. Six sets of the original echocardiography databases were hold out to be used as unseen data to test the performance of the CNN. In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the HODMD technique, two testcases are studied: the CNN is first trained using the original echocardiography images only, and second training the CNN using a combination of the original images and the DMD modes. The classification performance of the designed trained CNN shows that combining the original images with the DMD modes improves the results in all the testcases, as it improves the accuracy by up to 22%. These results show the great potential of using the HODMD algorithm as a data augmentation technique.</description>

      <title>Variable-size Symmetry-based Graph Fourier Transforms for image compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern compression systems use linear transformations in their encoding and decoding processes, with transforms providing compact signal representations. While multiple data-dependent transforms for image/video coding can adapt to diverse statistical characteristics, assembling large datasets to learn each transform is challenging. Also, the resulting transforms typically lack fast implementation, leading to significant computational costs. Thus, despite many papers proposing new transform families, the most recent compression standards predominantly use traditional separable sinusoidal transforms. This paper proposes integrating a new family of Symmetry-based Graph Fourier Transforms (SBGFTs) of variable sizes into a coding framework, focusing on the extension from our previously introduced 8x8 SBGFTs to the general case of NxN grids. SBGFTs are non-separable transforms that achieve sparse signal representation while maintaining low computational complexity thanks to their symmetry properties. Their design is based on our proposed algorithm, which generates symmetric graphs on the grid by adding specific symmetrical connections between nodes and does not require any data-dependent adaptation. Furthermore, for video intra-frame coding, we exploit the correlations between optimal graphs and prediction modes to reduce the cardinality of the transform sets, thus proposing a low-complexity framework. Experiments show that SBGFTs outperform the primary transforms integrated in the explicit Multiple Transform Selection (MTS) used in the latest VVC intra-coding, providing a bit rate saving percentage of 6.23%, with only a marginal increase in average complexity. A MATLAB implementation of the proposed algorithm is available online at [1].</description>

      <title>Optimizing Brain Tumor Segmentation with MedNeXt: BraTS 2024 SSA and Pediatrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15872v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key pathological features in brain MRIs is crucial for the long-term survival of glioma patients. However, manual segmentation is time-consuming, requiring expert intervention and is susceptible to human error. Therefore, significant research has been devoted to developing machine learning methods that can accurately segment tumors in 3D multimodal brain MRI scans. Despite their progress, state-of-the-art models are often limited by the data they are trained on, raising concerns about their reliability when applied to diverse populations that may introduce distribution shifts. Such shifts can stem from lower quality MRI technology (e.g., in sub-Saharan Africa) or variations in patient demographics (e.g., children). The BraTS-2024 challenge provides a platform to address these issues. This study presents our methodology for segmenting tumors in the BraTS-2024 SSA and Pediatric Tumors tasks using MedNeXt, comprehensive model ensembling, and thorough postprocessing. Our approach demonstrated strong performance on the unseen validation set, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.896 on the BraTS-2024 SSA dataset and an average DSC of 0.830 on the BraTS Pediatric Tumor dataset. Additionally, our method achieved an average Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 14.682 on the BraTS-2024 SSA dataset and an average HD95 of 37.508 on the BraTS Pediatric dataset.

      <title>PromptHSI: Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration Framework for Composite Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in All-in-One (AiO) RGB image restoration and prompt learning have enabled the representation of distinct degradations through prompts, allowing degraded images to be effectively addressed by a single restoration model. However, this paradigm faces significant challenges when transferring to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration tasks due to: 1) the domain gap between RGB and HSI features and difference on their structures, 2) information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and 3) difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation representations through text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework. By leveraging the frequency-aware feature modulation based on characteristics of HSI degradations, we decompose text prompts into intensity and bias controllers to effectively guide the restoration process while avoiding domain gaps. Our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance under various degradation combinations, indicating great potential for practical remote sensing applications. The source code and dataset will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Cross-organ Deployment of EOS Detection AI without Retraining: Feasibility and Limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by persistent inflammation in the paranasal sinuses, leading to typical symptoms of nasal congestion, facial pressure, olfactory dysfunction, and discolored nasal drainage, which can significantly impact quality-of-life. Eosinophils (Eos), a crucial component in the mucosal immune response, have been linked to disease severity in CRS. The diagnosis of eosinophilic CRS typically uses a threshold of 10-20 eos per high-power field (HPF). However, manually counting Eos in histological samples is laborious and time-intensive, making the use of AI-driven methods for automated evaluations highly desirable. Interestingly, eosinophils are predominantly located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, which has prompted the release of numerous deep learning models trained on GI data. This study leverages a CircleSnake model initially trained on upper-GI data to segment Eos cells in whole slide images (WSIs) of nasal tissues. It aims to determine the extent to which Eos segmentation models developed for the GI tract can be adapted to nasal applications without retraining. The experimental results show promising accuracy in some WSIs, although, unsurprisingly, the performance varies across cases. This paper details these performance outcomes, delves into the reasons for such variations, and aims to provide insights that could guide future development of deep learning models for eosinophilic CRS.</description>

      <title>Peritumoral Expansion Radiomics for Improved Lung Cancer Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study investigated how nodule segmentation and surrounding peritumoral regions influence radionics-based lung cancer classification. Methods: Using 3D CT scans with bounding box annotated nodules, we generated 3D segmentations using four techniques: Otsu, Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Radiomics features were extracted using the PyRadiomics library, and multiple machine-learning-based classifiers, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and KNN, were employed to classify nodules as cancerous or non-cancerous. The best-performing segmentation and model were further analyzed by expanding the initial nodule segmentation into the peritumoral region (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 mm) to understand the influence of the surrounding area on classification. Additionally, we compared our results to deep learning-based feature extractors Foundation Model for Cancer Biomarkers (FMCB) and other state-of-the-art baseline models. Results: Incorporating peritumoral regions significantly enhanced performance, with the best result obtained at 8 mm expansion (AUC = 0.78). Compared to image-based deep learning models, such as FMCB (AUC = 0.71) and ResNet50-SWS++ (AUC = 0.71), our radiomics-based approach demonstrated superior classification accuracy. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of peritumoral expansion in improving lung cancer classification using radiomics. These findings can inform the development of more robust AI-driven diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Lattice Vector Quantizers for End-to-end Neural Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is customary to deploy uniform scalar quantization in the end-to-end optimized Neural image compression methods, instead of more powerful vector quantization, due to the high complexity of the latter. Lattice vector quantization (LVQ), on the other hand, presents a compelling alternative, which can exploit inter-feature dependencies more effectively while keeping computational efficiency almost the same as scalar quantization. However, traditional LVQ structures are designed/optimized for uniform source distributions, hence nonadaptive and suboptimal for real source distributions of latent code space for Neural image compression tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning method to overcome this weakness by designing the rate-distortion optimal lattice vector quantization (OLVQ) codebooks with respect to the sample statistics of the latent features to be compressed. By being able to better fit the LVQ structures to any given latent sample distribution, the proposed OLVQ method improves the rate-distortion performances of the existing quantization schemes in neural image compression significantly, while retaining the amenability of uniform scalar quantization.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Be Aware! Improving the Self-Supervised Real-World Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning is crucial for super-resolution because ground-truth images are usually unavailable for real-world settings. Existing methods derive self-supervision from low-resolution images by creating pseudo-pairs or by enforcing a low-resolution reconstruction objective. These methods struggle with insufficient modeling of real-world degradations and the lack of knowledge about high-resolution imagery, resulting in unnatural super-resolved results. This paper strengthens awareness of the high-resolution image to improve the self-supervised real-world super-resolution. We propose a controller to adjust the degradation modeling based on the quality of super-resolution results. We also introduce a novel feature-alignment regularizer that directly constrains the distribution of super-resolved images. Our method finetunes the off-the-shelf SR models for a target real-world domain. Experiments show that it produces natural super-resolved images with state-of-the-art perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>UltraSam: A Foundation Model for Ultrasound using Large Open-Access Segmentation Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Automated ultrasound image analysis is challenging due to anatomical complexity and limited annotated data. To tackle this, we take a data-centric approach, assembling the largest public ultrasound segmentation dataset and training a versatile visual foundation model tailored for ultrasound.
  Methods: We compile US-43d, a large-scale collection of 43 open-access ultrasound datasets with over 280,000 images and segmentation masks for more than 50 anatomical structures. We then introduce UltraSam, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that is trained on US-43d and supports both point- and box-prompts. Finally, we introduce a new use case for SAM-style models by using UltraSam as a model initialization that can be fine-tuned for various downstream analysis tasks, demonstrating UltraSam's foundational capabilities.
  Results: UltraSam achieves vastly improved performance over existing SAM-style models for prompt-based segmentation on three diverse public datasets. Moreover, an UltraSam-initialized Vision Transformer surpasses ImageNet-, SAM-, and MedSAM-initialized models in various downstream segmentation and classification tasks, highlighting UltraSam's effectiveness as a foundation model.
  Conclusion: We compile US-43d, a large-scale unified ultrasound dataset, and introduce UltraSam, a powerful multi-purpose SAM-style model for ultrasound images. We release our code and pretrained models at https://github.com/CAMMA-public/UltraSam and invite the community to further this effort by contributing high-quality datasets.</description>

      <title>EigenHearts: Cardiac Diseases Classification Using EigenFaces Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of cardiovascular medicine, medical imaging plays a crucial role in accurately classifying cardiac diseases and making precise diagnoses. However, the field faces significant challenges when integrating data science techniques, as a significant volume of images is required for these techniques. As a consequence, it is necessary to investigate different avenues to overcome this challenge. In this contribution, we offer an innovative tool to conquer this limitation. In particular, we delve into the application of a well recognized method known as the EigenFaces approach to classify cardiac diseases. This approach was originally motivated for efficiently representing pictures of faces using principal component analysis, which provides a set of eigenvectors (aka eigenfaces), explaining the variation between face images. As this approach proven to be efficient for face recognition, it motivated us to explore its efficiency on more complicated data bases. In particular, we integrate this approach, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify echocardiography images taken from mice in five distinct cardiac conditions (healthy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, myocardial infarction, obesity and TAC hypertension). Performing a preprocessing step inspired from the eigenfaces approach on the echocardiography datasets, yields sets of pod modes, which we will call eigenhearts. To demonstrate the proposed approach, we compare two testcases: (i) supplying the CNN with the original images directly, (ii) supplying the CNN with images projected into the obtained pod modes. The results show a substantial and noteworthy enhancement when employing SVD for pre-processing, with classification accuracy increasing by approximately 50%.</description>

      <title>WTDUN: Wavelet Tree-Structured Sampling and Deep Unfolding Network for Image Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks have gained increasing attention in the field of compressed sensing (CS) owing to their theoretical interpretability and superior reconstruction performance. However, most existing deep unfolding methods often face the following issues: 1) they learn directly from single-channel images, leading to a simple feature representation that does not fully capture complex features; and 2) they treat various image components uniformly, ignoring the characteristics of different components. To address these issues, we propose a novel wavelet-domain deep unfolding framework named WTDUN, which operates directly on the multi-scale wavelet subbands. Our method utilizes the intrinsic sparsity and multi-scale structure of wavelet coefficients to achieve a tree-structured sampling and reconstruction, effectively capturing and highlighting the most important features within images. Specifically, the design of tree-structured reconstruction aims to capture the inter-dependencies among the multi-scale subbands, enabling the identification of both fine and coarse features, which can lead to a marked improvement in reconstruction quality. Furthermore, a wavelet domain adaptive sampling method is proposed to greatly improve the sampling capability, which is realized by assigning measurements to each wavelet subband based on its importance. Unlike pure deep learning methods that treat all components uniformly, our method introduces a targeted focus on important subbands, considering their energy and sparsity. This targeted strategy lets us capture key information more efficiently while discarding less important information, resulting in a more effective and detailed reconstruction. Extensive experimental results on various datasets validate the superior performance of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Foundation Model for Generalist Ultrasound Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical diagnosis due to its non-invasive nature and real-time capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnostics face several limitations, including high dependence on physician expertise and suboptimal image quality, which complicates interpretation and increases the likelihood of diagnostic errors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance clinical diagnosis, particularly in detecting abnormalities across various biomedical imaging modalities. Nonetheless, current AI models for ultrasound imaging face critical challenges. First, these models often require large volumes of labeled medical data, raising concerns over patient privacy breaches. Second, most existing models are task-specific, which restricts their broader clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, we present UltraFedFM, an innovative privacy-preserving ultrasound foundation model. UltraFedFM is collaboratively pre-trained using federated learning across 16 distributed medical institutions in 9 countries, leveraging a dataset of over 1 million ultrasound images covering 19 organs and 10 ultrasound modalities. This extensive and diverse data, combined with a secure training framework, enables UltraFedFM to exhibit strong generalization and diagnostic capabilities. It achieves an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.927 for disease diagnosis and a dice similarity coefficient of 0.878 for lesion segmentation. Notably, UltraFedFM surpasses the diagnostic accuracy of mid-level ultrasonographers and matches the performance of expert-level sonographers in the joint diagnosis of 8 common systemic diseases. These findings indicate that UltraFedFM can significantly enhance clinical diagnostics while safeguarding patient privacy, marking an advancement in AI-driven ultrasound imaging for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>PriorPath: Coarse-To-Fine Approach for Controlled De-Novo Pathology Semantic Masks Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into digital pathology offers promising prospects for automating and enhancing tasks such as image analysis and diagnostic processes. However, the diversity of tissue samples and the necessity for meticulous image labeling often result in biased datasets, constraining the applicability of algorithms trained on them. To harness synthetic histopathological images to cope with this challenge, it is essential not only to produce photorealistic images but also to be able to exert control over the cellular characteristics they depict. Previous studies used methods to generate, from random noise, semantic masks that captured the spatial distribution of the tissue. These masks were then used as a prior for conditional generative approaches to produce photorealistic histopathological images. However, as with many other generative models, this solution exhibits mode collapse as the model fails to capture the full diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we present a pipeline, coined PriorPath, that generates detailed, realistic, semantic masks derived from coarse-grained images delineating tissue regions. This approach enables control over the spatial arrangement of the generated masks and, consequently, the resulting synthetic images. We demonstrated the efficacy of our method across three cancer types, skin, prostate, and lung, showcasing PriorPath's capability to cover the semantic mask space and to provide better similarity to real masks compared to previous methods. Our approach allows for specifying desired tissue distributions and obtaining both photorealistic masks and images within a single platform, thus providing a state-of-the-art, controllable solution for generating histopathological images to facilitate AI for computational pathology.</description>

      <title>ADOBI: Adaptive Diffusion Bridge For Blind Inverse Problems with Application to MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion bridges (DB) have emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion models for imaging inverse problems, achieving faster sampling by directly bridging low- and high-quality image distributions. While incorporating measurement consistency has been shown to improve performance, existing DB methods fail to maintain this consistency in blind inverse problems, where the forward model is unknown. To address this limitation, we introduce ADOBI (Adaptive Diffusion Bridge for Inverse Problems), a novel framework that adaptively calibrates the unknown forward model to enforce measurement consistency throughout sampling iterations. Our adaptation strategy allows ADOBI to achieve high-quality parallel magnetic resonance imaging (PMRI) reconstruction in only 5-10 steps. Our numerical results show that ADOBI consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance, and further advances the Pareto frontier for the perception-distortion trade-off.</description>

      <title>Coherence Based Sound Speed Aberration Correction -- with clinical validation in obstetric ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to demonstrate a robust and clinically validated method for correcting sound speed aberrations in medical ultrasound. We propose a correction method that calculates focusing delays directly from the observed two-way distributed average sound speed. The method beamforms multiple coherence images and selects the sound speed that maximizes the coherence for each image pixel. The main contribution of this work is the direct estimation of aberration, without the ill-posed inversion of a local sound speed map, and the proposed processing of coherence images which adapts to in vivo situations where low coherent regions and off-axis scattering represents a challenge. The method is validated in vitro and in silico showing high correlation with ground truth speed of sound maps. Further, the method is clinically validated by being applied to channel data recorded from 172 obstetric Bmode images, and 12 case examples are presented and discussed in detail. The data is recorded with a GE HealthCare Voluson Expert 22 system with an eM6c matrix array probe. The images are evaluated by three expert clinicians, and the results show that the corrected images are preferred or gave equivalent quality to no correction (1540m/s) for 72.5% of the 172 images. In addition, a sharpness metric from digital photography is used to quantify image quality improvement. The increase in sharpness and the change in average sound speed are shown to be linearly correlated with a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.67.</description>

      <title>LegoPET: Hierarchical Feature Guided Conditional Diffusion for PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is widely utilized for cancer detection due to its ability to visualize functional and biological processes in vivo. PET images are usually reconstructed from histogrammed raw data (sinograms) using traditional iterative techniques (e.g., OSEM, MLEM). Recently, deep learning (DL) methods have shown promise by directly mapping raw sinogram data to PET images. However, DL approaches that are regression-based or GAN-based often produce overly smoothed images or introduce various artifacts respectively. Image-conditioned diffusion probabilistic models (cDPMs) are another class of likelihood-based DL techniques capable of generating highly realistic and controllable images. While cDPMs have notable strengths, they still face challenges such as maintain correspondence and consistency between input and output images when they are from different domains (e.g., sinogram vs. image domain) as well as slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we introduce LegoPET, a hierarchical feature guided conditional diffusion model for high-perceptual quality PET image reconstruction from sinograms. We conducted several experiments demonstrating that LegoPET not only improves the performance of cDPMs but also surpasses recent DL-based PET image reconstruction techniques in terms of visual quality and pixel-level PSNR/SSIM metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/yransun/LegoPET.</description>

      <title>Automated Registration of 3D Neurovascular Territory Atlas to 2D DSA for Targeted Quantitative Angiography Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), typically due to intracranial aneurysms, demands precise imaging for effective treatment. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA), despite being the gold standard, broadly visualizes cerebral blood flow, potentially masking key details in areas. This study introduces an approach integrating a 3D vascular atlas with 2D DSA images to allow targeted quantitative analysis in these crucial regions, thus enhancing diagnostic accuracy during interventions. Initially, DSA data was examined to ascertain the injection site. Following this, the appropriate viewing angle was determined to align accurately with the 3D vascular atlas. Utilizing this atlas, regions corresponding to the areas indicated as perfused were selected. Concurrently, a mask representing the perfused areas was created from the DSA sequence. This mask facilitated the initial coarse alignment of the projected 3D atlas to the DSA perfused territory deformable registration techniques, ensuring a precise overlay with the DSAs perfused territories. The performance of each overlay was measured using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). The coregistration process revealed that deformable registrations was essential to achieve precise overlays of the 3D atlas projections with the 2D DSA perfused areas. This approach enabled the extraction of targeted quantitative angiography parameters, essential for detailed vascular assessment in subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. The integration of 3D atlas registration with 2D DSA projections facilitates a more precise and targeted diagnostic process for SAH during critical interventions. This image processing strategy enhances the visualization of affected arterial territories, potentially improving the accuracy of diagnostics and supporting better informed clinical decisions at the time of intervention</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperkinetic movement disorders (HMDs) in children, including dystonia (abnormal twisting) and chorea (irregular, random movements), pose significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping clinical features. The prevalence of dystonia ranges from 2 to 50 per million, and chorea from 5 to 10 per 100,000. These conditions are often diagnosed with delays averaging 4.75 to 7.83 years. Traditional diagnostic methods depend on clinical history and expert physical examinations, but specialized tests are ineffective due to the complex pathophysiology of these disorders. This study develops a neural network model to differentiate between dystonia and chorea from video recordings of paediatric patients performing motor tasks. The model integrates a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to capture spatial relationships and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to account for temporal dynamics. Attention mechanisms were incorporated to improve model interpretability. The model was trained and validated on a dataset of 50 videos (31 chorea-predominant, 19 dystonia-predominant) collected under regulatory approval from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. The model achieved 85% accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 88% specificity at 15 frames per second. Attention maps highlighted the model's ability to correctly identify involuntary movement patterns, with misclassifications often due to occluded body parts or subtle movement variations. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of HMD diagnosis and could contribute to more reliable, interpretable clinical tools.</description>

      <title>GeoScatt-GNN: A Geometric Scattering Transform-Based Graph Neural Network Model for Ames Mutagenicity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of mutagenicity prediction by introducing three ground-breaking approaches. First, it showcases the superior performance of 2D scattering coefficients extracted from molecular images, compared to traditional molecular descriptors. Second, it presents a hybrid approach that combines geometric graph scattering (GGS), Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN), and machine learning models, achieving strong results in mutagenicity prediction. Third, it introduces a novel graph neural network architecture, MOLG3-SAGE, which integrates GGS node features into a fully connected graph structure, delivering outstanding predictive accuracy. Experimental results on the ZINC dataset demonstrate significant improvements, emphasizing the effectiveness of blending 2D and geometric scattering techniques with graph neural networks. This study illustrates the potential of GNNs and GGS for mutagenicity prediction, with broad implications for drug discovery and chemical safety assessment.</description>

      <title>A Constrast-Agnostic Method for Ultra-High Resolution Claustrum Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The claustrum is a band-like gray matter structure located between putamen and insula whose exact functions are still actively researched. Its sheet-like structure makes it barely visible in in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans at typical resolutions and neuroimaging tools for its study, including methods for automatic segmentation, are currently very limited. In this paper, we propose a contrast- and resolution-agnostic method for claustrum segmentation at ultra-high resolution (0.35 mm isotropic); the method is based on the SynthSeg segmentation framework (Billot et al., 2023), which leverages the use of synthetic training intensity images to achieve excellent generalization. In particular, SynthSeg requires only label maps to be trained, since corresponding intensity images are synthesized on the fly with random contrast and resolution. We trained a deep learning network for automatic claustrum segmentation, using claustrum manual labels obtained from 18 ultra-high resolution MRI scans (mostly ex vivo). We demonstrated the method to work on these 18 high resolution cases (Dice score = 0.632, mean surface distance = 0.458 mm, and volumetric similarity = 0.867 using 6-fold Cross Validation (CV)), and also on in vivo T1-weighted MRI scans at typical resolutions (~1 mm isotropic). We also demonstrated that the method is robust in a test-retest setting and when applied to multimodal imaging (T2-weighted, Proton Density and quantitative T1 scans). To the best of our knowledge this is the first accurate method for automatic ultra-high resolution claustrum segmentation, which is robust against changes in contrast and resolution. The method is released at https://github.com/chiara-mauri/claustrum_segmentation and as part of the neuroimaging package Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012).</description>

      <title>Improving Factuality of 3D Brain MRI Report Generation with Paired Image-domain Retrieval and Text-domain Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires time-critical management, with hours of delayed intervention leading to an irreversible disability of the patient. Since diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) using the magnetic resonance image (MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection of AIS, automated prediction of AIS from DWI has been a research topic of clinical importance. While text radiology reports contain the most relevant clinical information from the image findings, the difficulty of mapping across different modalities has limited the factuality of conventional direct DWI-to-report generation methods. Here, we propose paired image-domain retrieval and text-domain augmentation (PIRTA), a cross-modal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for providing clinician-interpretative AIS radiology reports with improved factuality. PIRTA mitigates the need for learning cross-modal mapping, which poses difficulty in image-to-text generation, by casting the cross-modal mapping problem as an in-domain retrieval of similar DWI images that have paired ground-truth text radiology reports. By exploiting the retrieved radiology reports to augment the report generation process of the query image, we show by experiments with extensive in-house and public datasets that PIRTA can accurately retrieve relevant reports from 3D DWI images. This approach enables the generation of radiology reports with significantly higher accuracy compared to direct image-to-text generation using state-of-the-art multimodal language models.</description>

      <title>Optical-Flow Guided Prompt Optimization for Coherent Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While text-to-video diffusion models have made significant strides, many still face challenges in generating videos with temporal consistency. Within diffusion frameworks, guidance techniques have proven effective in enhancing output quality during inference; however, applying these methods to video diffusion models introduces additional complexity of handling computations across entire sequences. To address this, we propose a novel framework called MotionPrompt that guides the video generation process via optical flow. Specifically, we train a discriminator to distinguish optical flow between random pairs of frames from real videos and generated ones. Given that prompts can influence the entire video, we optimize learnable token embeddings during reverse sampling steps by using gradients from a trained discriminator applied to random frame pairs. This approach allows our method to generate visually coherent video sequences that closely reflect natural motion dynamics, without compromising the fidelity of the generated content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various models.</description>

      <title>FLD+: Data-efficient Evaluation Metric for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new metric to assess the quality of generated images that is more reliable, data-efficient, compute-efficient, and adaptable to new domains than the previous metrics, such as Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). The proposed metric is based on normalizing flows, which allows for the computation of density (exact log-likelihood) of images from any domain. Thus, unlike FID, the proposed Flow-based Likelihood Distance Plus (FLD+) metric exhibits strongly monotonic behavior with respect to different types of image degradations, including noise, occlusion, diffusion steps, and generative model size. Additionally, because normalizing flow can be trained stably and efficiently, FLD+ achieves stable results with two orders of magnitude fewer images than FID (which requires more images to reliably compute Fr\'echet distance between features of large samples of real and generated images). We made FLD+ computationally even more efficient by applying normalizing flows to features extracted in a lower-dimensional latent space instead of using a pre-trained network. We also show that FLD+ can easily be retrained on new domains, such as medical images, unlike the networks behind previous metrics -- such as InceptionNetV3 pre-trained on ImageNet.</description>

      <title>A Tunable Despeckling Neural Network Stabilized via Diffusion Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplicative Gamma noise remove is a critical research area in the application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging, where neural networks serve as a potent tool. However, real-world data often diverges from theoretical models, exhibiting various disturbances, which makes the neural network less effective. Adversarial attacks work by finding perturbations that significantly disrupt functionality of neural networks, as the inherent instability of neural networks makes them highly susceptible. A network designed to withstand such extreme cases can more effectively mitigate general disturbances in real SAR data. In this work, the dissipative nature of diffusion equations is employed to underpin a novel approach for countering adversarial attacks and improve the resistance of real noise disturbance. We propose a tunable, regularized neural network that unrolls a denoising unit and a regularization unit into a single network for end-to-end training. In the network, the denoising unit and the regularization unit are composed of the denoising network and the simplest linear diffusion equation respectively. The regularization unit enhances network stability, allowing post-training time step adjustments to effectively mitigate the adverse impacts of adversarial attacks. The stability and convergence of our model are theoretically proven, and in the experiments, we compare our model with several state-of-the-art denoising methods on simulated images, adversarial samples, and real SAR images, yielding superior results in both quantitative and visual evaluations.</description>

      <title>Luminance Component Analysis for Exposure Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exposure correction methods aim to adjust the luminance while maintaining other luminance-unrelated information. However, current exposure correction methods have difficulty in fully separating luminance-related and luminance-unrelated components, leading to distortions in color, loss of detail, and requiring extra restoration procedures. Inspired by principal component analysis (PCA), this paper proposes an exposure correction method called luminance component analysis (LCA). LCA applies the orthogonal constraint to a U-Net structure to decouple luminance-related and luminance-unrelated features. With decoupled luminance-related features, LCA adjusts only the luminance-related components while keeping the luminance-unrelated components unchanged. To optimize the orthogonal constraint problem, LCA employs a geometric optimization algorithm, which converts the constrained problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained problem in orthogonal Stiefel manifolds. Extensive experiments show that LCA can decouple the luminance feature from the RGB color space. Moreover, LCA achieves the best PSNR (21.33) and SSIM (0.88) in the exposure correction dataset with 28.72 FPS.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the greater scope of Deep Learning-based computer vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has given rise to challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation by discussing fundamental concepts in uncertainty that govern advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. We identify that quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty approximates Bayesian inference w.r.t. to either latent variables or model parameters, respectively. Moreover, literature on both uncertainties trace back to four key applications; (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) active learning. Then, a discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and comparison of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty-based active learning, standardization and benchmarking, and recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</description>

      <title>Synthesising Handwritten Music with GANs: A Comprehensive Evaluation of CycleWGAN, ProGAN, and DCGAN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of handwritten music sheets is a crucial step toward enhancing Optical Music Recognition (OMR) systems, which rely on large and diverse datasets for optimal performance. However, handwritten music sheets, often found in archives, present challenges for digitisation due to their fragility, varied handwriting styles, and image quality. This paper addresses the data scarcity problem by applying Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesise realistic handwritten music sheets. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of three GAN models - DCGAN, ProGAN, and CycleWGAN - comparing their ability to generate diverse and high-quality handwritten music images. The proposed CycleWGAN model, which enhances style transfer and training stability, significantly outperforms DCGAN and ProGAN in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. CycleWGAN achieves superior performance, with an FID score of 41.87, an IS of 2.29, and a KID of 0.05, making it a promising solution for improving OMR systems.</description>

      <title>Cutting Voxel Projector a New Approach to Construct 3D Cone Beam CT Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel class of projectors for 3D cone beam tomographic reconstruction. Analytical formulas are derived to compute the relationship between the volume of a voxel projected onto a detector pixel and its contribution to the line integral of attenuation recorded by that pixel. Based on these formulas, we construct a near-exact projector and backprojector, particularly suited for algebraic reconstruction techniques and hierarchical reconstruction approaches with nonuniform voxel grids. Unlike traditional projectors, which assume a uniform grid with fixed voxel sizes, our method enables local refinement of voxels, allowing for adaptive grid resolution and improved reconstruction quality in regions of interest. We have implemented this cutting voxel projector along with a relaxed, speed-optimized version and compared them to two established projectors: a ray-tracing projector based on Siddon's algorithm and a TT footprint projector. Our results demonstrate that the cutting voxel projector achieves higher accuracy than the TT projector, especially for large cone beam angles. Furthermore, the relaxed version of the cutting voxel projector offers a significant speed advantage over current footprint projector implementations, while maintaining comparable accuracy. In contrast, Siddon's algorithm, when achieving similar accuracy, is considerably slower than the cutting voxel projector. All algorithms are implemented in an open-source framework for algebraic reconstruction using OpenCL and C++, optimized for efficient GPU computation.

Abstract: We consider the image and video compression on resource limited platforms. An ultra low-cost image encoder, named Block Modulating Video Compression (BMVC) with an encoding complexity ${\cal O}(1)$ is proposed to be implemented on mobile platforms with low consumption of power and computation resources. We also develop two types of BMVC decoders, implemented by deep neural networks. The first BMVC decoder is based on the Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithm, which is flexible to different compression ratios. And the second decoder is a memory efficient end-to-end convolutional neural network, which aims for real-time decoding. Extensive results on the high definition images and videos demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed codec and the robustness against bit quantization.</description>

      <title>MRI Recovery with Self-Calibrated Denoisers without Fully-Sampled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Acquiring fully sampled training data is challenging for many MRI applications. We present a self-supervised image reconstruction method, termed ReSiDe, capable of recovering images solely from undersampled data.
  Materials and Methods: ReSiDe is inspired by plug-and-play (PnP) methods, but unlike traditional PnP approaches that utilize pre-trained denoisers, ReSiDe iteratively trains the denoiser on the image or images that are being reconstructed. We introduce two variations of our method: ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M. ReSiDe-S is scan-specific and works with a single set of undersampled measurements, while ReSiDe-M operates on multiple sets of undersampled measurements and provides faster inference. Studies I, II, and III compare ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M against other self-supervised or unsupervised methods using data from T1- and T2-weighted brain MRI, MRXCAT digital perfusion phantom, and first-pass cardiac perfusion, respectively.
  Results: ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M outperform other methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure for Studies I and II, and in terms of expert scoring for Study III.
  Discussion: We present a self-supervised image reconstruction method and validate it in both static and dynamic MRI applications. These developments can benefit MRI applications where the availability of fully sampled training data is limited.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we outline our approach to identify ophthalmic biomarkers from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images presented in the OLIVES dataset, obtained from a diverse range of patients. Using robust augmentations and 5-fold cross-validation, we trained two vision transformer-based models: MaxViT and EVA-02, and ensembled them at inference time. We find MaxViT's use of convolution layers followed by strided attention to be better suited for local feature detection while EVA-02's use of normal attention mechanism and knowledge distillation is better for detecting global features. Our solution brought us the champion title of the IEEE SPS Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup 2023, achieving a patient-wise F1 score of 0.814 in the first phase and 0.8527 in the second and final phase of the competition, scoring 3.8% higher than the next best solution.</description>

      <title>FDDM: Unsupervised Medical Image Translation with a Frequency-Decoupled Diffusion Model</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated significant potential in producing high-quality images in medical image translation to aid disease diagnosis, localization, and treatment. Nevertheless, current diffusion models have limited success in achieving faithful image translations that can accurately preserve the anatomical structures of medical images, especially for unpaired datasets. The preservation of structural and anatomical details is essential to reliable medical diagnosis and treatment planning, as structural mismatches can lead to disease misidentification and treatment errors. In this study, we introduce the Frequency Decoupled Diffusion Model (FDDM) for MR-to-CT conversion. FDDM first obtains the anatomical information of the CT image from the MR image through an initial conversion module. This anatomical information then guides a subsequent diffusion model to generate high-quality CT images. Our diffusion model uses a dual-path reverse diffusion process for low-frequency and high-frequency information, achieving a better balance between image quality and anatomical accuracy. We extensively evaluated FDDM using public datasets for brain MR-to-CT and pelvis MR-to-CT translations, demonstrating its superior performance to other GAN-based, VAE-based, and diffusion-based models. The evaluation metrics included Frechet Inception Distance (FID), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). FDDM achieved the best scores on all metrics for both datasets, particularly excelling in FID, with scores of 25.9 for brain data and 29.2 for pelvis data, significantly outperforming other methods. These results demonstrate that FDDM can generate high-quality target domain images while maintaining the accuracy of translated anatomical structures.</description>

      <title>ContourDiff: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Structural Consistency for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preserving object structure through image-to-image translation is crucial, particularly in applications such as medical imaging (e.g., CT-to-MRI translation), where downstream clinical and machine learning applications will often rely on such preservation. However, typical image-to-image translation algorithms prioritize perceptual quality with respect to output domain features over the preservation of anatomical structures. To address these challenges, we first introduce a novel metric to quantify the structural bias between domains which must be considered for proper translation. We then propose ContourDiff, a novel image-to-image translation algorithm that leverages domain-invariant anatomical contour representations of images to preserve the anatomical structures during translation. These contour representations are simple to extract from images, yet form precise spatial constraints on their anatomical content. ContourDiff applies an input image contour representation as a constraint at every sampling step of a diffusion model trained in the output domain, ensuring anatomical content preservation for the output image. We evaluate our method on challenging lumbar spine and hip-and-thigh CT-to-MRI translation tasks, via (1) the performance of segmentation models trained on translated images applied to real MRIs, and (2) the foreground FID and KID of translated images with respect to real MRIs. Our method outperforms other unpaired image translation methods by a significant margin across almost all metrics and scenarios. Moreover, it achieves this without the need to access any input domain information during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early-stage 3D brain tumor segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans is crucial for prompt and effective treatment. However, this process faces the challenge of precise delineation due to the tumors' complex heterogeneity. Moreover, energy sustainability targets and resource limitations, especially in developing countries, require efficient and accessible medical imaging solutions. The proposed architecture, a Lightweight 3D ATtention U-Net with Parallel convolutions, LATUP-Net, addresses these issues. It is specifically designed to reduce computational requirements significantly while maintaining high segmentation performance. By incorporating parallel convolutions, it enhances feature representation by capturing multi-scale information. It further integrates an attention mechanism to refine segmentation through selective feature recalibration. LATUP-Net achieves promising segmentation performance: the average Dice scores for the whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor on the BraTS 2020 dataset are 88.41%, 83.82%, and 73.67%, and on the BraTS 2021 dataset, they are 90.29%, 89.54%, and 83.92%, respectively. Hausdorff distance metrics further indicate its improved ability to delineate tumor boundaries. With its significantly reduced computational demand using only 3.07M parameters, about 59 times fewer than other state-of-the-art models, and running on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX3060 12GB GPU, LATUP-Net requires just 15.79 GFLOPs. This makes it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications, particularly in settings with limited resources. Investigations into the model's interpretability, utilizing gradient-weighted class activation mapping and confusion matrices, reveal that while attention mechanisms enhance the segmentation of small regions, their impact is nuanced. Achieving the most [...]. The code is available at https://qyber.black/ca/code-bca.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are indispensable in the fields of remote sensing and photogrammetry, with their refinement and enhancement being critical for a diverse array of applications. Numerous methods have been developed for enhancing DEMs, but most of them concentrate on tackling specific tasks individually. This paper presents a unified generative model for multipurpose DEM restoration, diverging from the conventional approach that typically targets isolated tasks. We modify the mean-reverting stochastic differential equation, to generally refine the DEMs by conditioning on the learned terrain priors. The proposed Efficient Terrain Stochastic Differential Equation (ET-SDE) models DEM degradation through SDE progression and restores it via a simulated reversal process. Leveraging efficient submodules with lightweight channel attention, this adapted SDE boosts DEM quality and streamlines the training process. The experiments show that ET-SDE achieves highly competitive restoration performance on super-resolution, void filling, denoising, and their combinations, compared to the state-of-the-art work. In addition to its restoration capabilities, ET-SDE also demonstrates faster inference speeds and the capacity to generalize across various tasks, particularly for larger patches of DEMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient image transmission is essential for seamless communication and collaboration within the visually-driven digital landscape. To achieve low latency and high-quality image reconstruction over a bandwidth-constrained noisy wireless channel, we propose a stable diffusion (SD)-based goal-oriented semantic communication (GSC) framework. In this framework, we design a semantic autoencoder that effectively extracts semantic information (SI) from images to reduce the transmission data size while ensuring high-quality reconstruction. Recognizing the impact of wireless channel noise on SI transmission, we propose an SD-based denoiser for GSC (SD-GSC) conditional on an instantaneous channel gain to remove the channel noise from the received noisy SI under known channel. For scenarios with unknown channel, we further propose a parallel SD denoiser for GSC (PSD-GSC) to jointly learn the distribution of channel gains and denoise the received SI. It is shown that, with the known channel, our SD-GSC outperforms state-of-the-art ADJSCC and Latent-Diff DNSC, improving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 32% and 21%, and reducing Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) by 40% and 35%, respectively. With the unknown channel, our PSD-GSC improves PSNR by 8% and reduces FID by 17% compared to MMSE equalizer-enhanced SD-GSC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While large models have achieved significant progress in computer vision, challenges such as optimization complexity, the intricacy of transformer architectures, computational constraints, and practical application demands highlight the importance of simpler model designs in medical image segmentation. This need is particularly pronounced in mobile medical devices, which require lightweight, deployable models with real-time performance. However, existing lightweight models often suffer from poor robustness across datasets, limiting their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LV-UNet, a lightweight and vanilla model that leverages pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones and incorporates fusible modules. LV-UNet employs an enhanced deep training strategy and switches to a deployment mode during inference by re-parametrization, significantly reducing parameter count and computational overhead. Experimental results on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets demonstrate a better trade-off between performance and the computational load. The code will be released at \url{https://github.com/juntaoJianggavin/LV-UNet}.</description>

      <title>FCDM: Sparse-view Sinogram Inpainting with Frequency Domain Convolution Enhanced Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging technique that uses X-ray projections from multiple rotation angles to create detailed cross-sectional images, widely used in industrial inspection and medical diagnostics. Reducing the projection data in CT scans is often necessary to decrease radiation exposure, scanning time, and computational costs. However, this reduction makes accurate image reconstruction challenging due to the incomplete sinogram. Existing RGB inpainting models struggle with severe feature overlap, while current sinogram-specific models fail to employ efficient feature extraction methods that account for the physical principles underlying the sinogram generation process. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Frequency Convolution Diffusion Model (FCDM), a novel diffusion-based inpainting framework tailored for sinogram data. FCDM leverages frequency-domain convolutions to capture global and fine-grained structural features, effectively disentangling overlapping components across projection angles. Additionally, we propose a custom loss function that incorporates unique sinogram properties of total absorption consistency and frequency-domain consistency. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FCDM significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving SSIM over 0.95 and PSNR above 30 dB, with improvements of up to 33% in SSIM and 29% in PSNR compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Deep Learning Framework for Effective Brain Tumor Localization, Segmentation, and Classification from Magnetic Resonance Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tumors in the brain result from abnormal cell growth within the brain tissue, arising from various types of brain cells. When left undiagnosed, they lead to severe neurological deficits such as cognitive impairment, motor dysfunction, and sensory loss. As the tumor grows, it causes an increase in intracranial pressure, potentially leading to life-threatening complications such as brain herniation. Therefore, early detection and treatment are necessary to manage the complications caused by such tumors to slow down their growth. Numerous works involving deep learning (DL) and artificial intelligence (AI) are being carried out to assist physicians in early diagnosis by utilizing the scans obtained through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Our research proposes DL frameworks for localizing, segmenting, and classifying the grade of these gliomas from MRI images to solve this critical issue. In our localization framework, we enhance the LinkNet framework with a VGG19- inspired encoder architecture for improved multimodal tumor feature extraction, along with spatial and graph attention mechanisms to refine feature focus and inter-feature relationships. Following this, we integrated the SeResNet101 CNN model as the encoder backbone into the LinkNet framework for tumor segmentation, which achieved an IoU Score of 96%. To classify the segmented tumors, we combined the SeResNet152 feature extractor with an Adaptive Boosting classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 98.53%. Our proposed models demonstrated promising results, with the potential to advance medical AI by enabling early diagnosis and providing more accurate treatment options for patients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for low-cost, scalable approaches to measuring contactless vital signs, either during initial triage at a healthcare facility or virtual telemedicine visits. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) can accurately estimate heart rate (HR) when applied to close-up videos of healthy volunteers in well-lit laboratory settings. However, results from such highly optimized laboratory studies may not be readily translated to healthcare settings. One significant barrier to the practical application of rPPG in health care is the accurate localization of the region of interest (ROI). Clinical or telemedicine visits may involve sub-optimal lighting, movement artifacts, variable camera angle, and subject distance. This paper presents an rPPG ROI selection method based on 3D facial landmarks and patient head yaw angle. We then demonstrate the robustness of this ROI selection method when coupled to the Plane-Orthogonal-to-Skin (POS) rPPG method when applied to videos of patients presenting to an Emergency Department for respiratory complaints. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving the accuracy and robustness of rPPG in a challenging clinical environment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Medical Image Classification using Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classification of medical images is a pivotal aspect of disease diagnosis, often enhanced by deep learning techniques. However, traditional approaches typically focus on unimodal medical image data, neglecting the integration of diverse non-image patient data. This paper proposes a novel Cross-Graph Modal Contrastive Learning (CGMCL) framework for multimodal medical image classification. The model effectively integrates both image and non-image data by constructing cross-modality graphs and leveraging contrastive learning to align multimodal features in a shared latent space. An inter-modality feature scaling module further optimizes the representation learning process by reducing the gap between heterogeneous modalities. The proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets: a Parkinson's disease (PD) dataset and a public melanoma dataset. Results demonstrate that CGMCL outperforms conventional unimodal methods in accuracy, interpretability, and early disease prediction. Additionally, the method shows superior performance in multi-class melanoma classification. The CGMCL framework provides valuable insights into medical image classification while offering improved disease interpretability and predictive capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-semantic context information is crucial for visual recognition, as the human visual perception system first uses global statistics to process scenes rapidly before identifying specific objects. However, while semantic information is increasingly incorporated into computer vision tasks such as image reconstruction, non-semantic information, such as global spatial structures, is often overlooked. To bridge the gap, we propose a biologically informed non-semantic context descriptor, \textbf{MS-Glance}, along with the Glance Index Measure for comparing two images. A Global Glance vector is formulated by randomly retrieving pixels based on a perception-driven rule from an image to form a vector representing non-semantic global context, while a local Glance vector is a flattened local image window, mimicking a zoom-in observation. The Glance Index is defined as the inner product of two standardized sets of Glance vectors. We evaluate the effectiveness of incorporating Glance supervision in two reconstruction tasks: image fitting with implicit neural representation (INR) and undersampled MRI reconstruction. Extensive experimental results show that MS-Glance outperforms existing image restoration losses across both natural and medical images. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Z7Gao/MSGlance}.</description>

      <title>When Mamba Meets xLSTM: An Efficient and Precise Method with the XLSTM-VMUNet Model for Skin lesion Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic melanoma segmentation is essential for early skin cancer detection, yet challenges arise from the heterogeneity of melanoma, as well as interfering factors like blurred boundaries, low contrast, and imaging artifacts. While numerous algorithms have been developed to address these issues, previous approaches have often overlooked the need to jointly capture spatial and sequential features within dermatological images. This limitation hampers segmentation accuracy, especially in cases with indistinct borders or structurally similar lesions. Additionally, previous models lacked both a global receptive field and high computational efficiency. In this work, we present the XLSTM-VMUNet Model, which jointly capture spatial and sequential features within derma-tological images successfully. XLSTM-VMUNet can not only specialize in extracting spatial features from images, focusing on the structural characteristics of skin lesions, but also enhance contextual understanding, allowing more effective handling of complex medical image structures. Experiment results on the ISIC2018 dataset demonstrate that XLSTM-VMUNet outperforms VMUNet by 1.25% on DSC and 2.07% on IoU, with faster convergence and consistently high segmentation perfor-mance.

      <title>Enhancing Diagnostic Precision in Gastric Bleeding through Automated Lesion Segmentation: A Deep DuS-KFCM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timely and precise classification and segmentation of gastric bleeding in endoscopic imagery are pivotal for the rapid diagnosis and intervention of gastric complications, which is critical in life-saving medical procedures. Traditional methods grapple with the challenge posed by the indistinguishable intensity values of bleeding tissues adjacent to other gastric structures. Our study seeks to revolutionize this domain by introducing a novel deep learning model, the Dual Spatial Kernelized Constrained Fuzzy C-Means (Deep DuS-KFCM) clustering algorithm. This Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy system synergizes Neural Networks with Fuzzy Logic to offer a highly precise and efficient identification of bleeding regions. Implementing a two-fold coarse-to-fine strategy for segmentation, this model initially employs the Spatial Kernelized Fuzzy C-Means (SKFCM) algorithm enhanced with spatial intensity profiles and subsequently harnesses the state-of-the-art DeepLabv3+ with ResNet50 architecture to refine the segmentation output. Through extensive experiments across mainstream gastric bleeding and red spots datasets, our Deep DuS-KFCM model demonstrated unprecedented accuracy rates of 87.95%, coupled with a specificity of 96.33%, outperforming contemporary segmentation methods. The findings underscore the model's robustness against noise and its outstanding segmentation capabilities, particularly for identifying subtle bleeding symptoms, thereby presenting a significant leap forward in medical image processing.</description>

      <title>FocDepthFormer: Transformer with latent LSTM for Depth Estimation from Focal Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing methods for depth estimation from a focal stack of images employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using 2D or 3D convolutions over a fixed set of images. However, their effectiveness is constrained by the local properties of CNN kernels, which restricts them to process only focal stacks of fixed number of images during both training and inference. This limitation hampers their ability to generalize to stacks of arbitrary lengths. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel Transformer-based network, FocDepthFormer, which integrates a Transformer with an LSTM module and a CNN decoder. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism allows for the learning of more informative spatial features by implicitly performing non-local cross-referencing. The LSTM module is designed to integrate representations across image stacks of varying lengths. Additionally, we employ multi-scale convolutional kernels in an early-stage encoder to capture low-level features at different degrees of focus/defocus. By incorporating the LSTM, FocDepthFormer can be pre-trained on large-scale monocular RGB depth estimation datasets, improving visual pattern learning and reducing reliance on difficult-to-obtain focal stack data. Extensive experiments on diverse focal stack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Anomaly Detection for Lane Rendering Using Transformer with Self-Supervised Pre-Training and Customized Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz constant estimation for general neural network architectures using control tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the estimation of the Lipschitz constant of general neural network architectures using semidefinite programming. For this purpose, we interpret neural networks as time-varying dynamical systems, where the $k$-th layer corresponds to the dynamics at time $k$. A key novelty with respect to prior work is that we use this interpretation to exploit the series interconnection structure of feedforward neural networks with a dynamic programming recursion. Nonlinearities, such as activation functions and nonlinear pooling layers, are handled with integral quadratic constraints. If the neural network contains signal processing layers (convolutional or state space model layers), we realize them as 1-D/2-D/N-D systems and exploit this structure as well. We distinguish ourselves from related work on Lipschitz constant estimation by more extensive structure exploitation (scalability) and a generalization to a large class of common neural network architectures. To show the versatility and computational advantages of our method, we apply it to different neural network architectures trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion with arbitrary resolution through self-supervised representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) has emerged as an effective technique for achieving HSI super-resolution (SR). Previous studies have mainly concentrated on estimating the posterior distribution of the latent high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI), leveraging an appropriate image prior and likelihood computed from the discrepancy between the latent HSI and observed images. Low rankness stands out for preserving latent HSI characteristics through matrix factorization among the various priors. However, the primary limitation in previous studies lies in the generalization of a fusion model with fixed resolution scales, which necessitates retraining whenever output resolutions are changed. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel continuous low-rank factorization (CLoRF) by integrating two neural representations into the matrix factorization, capturing spatial and spectral information, respectively. This approach enables us to harness both the low rankness from the matrix factorization and the continuity from neural representation in a self-supervised manner.Theoretically, we prove the low-rank property and Lipschitz continuity in the proposed continuous low-rank factorization. Experimentally, our method significantly surpasses existing techniques and achieves user-desired resolutions without the need for neural network retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/wangting1907/CLoRF-Fusion.</description>

      <title>Large \'Etendue 3D Holographic Display with Content-adaptive Dynamic Fourier Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging holographic display technology offers unique capabilities for next-generation virtual reality systems. Current holographic near-eye displays, however, only support a small \'etendue, which results in a direct tradeoff between achievable field of view and eyebox size. \'Etendue expansion has recently been explored, but existing approaches are either fundamentally limited in the image quality that can be achieved or they require extremely high-speed spatial light modulators.
  We describe a new \'etendue expansion approach that combines multiple coherent sources with content-adaptive amplitude modulation of the hologram spectrum in the Fourier plane. To generate time-multiplexed phase and amplitude patterns for our spatial light modulators, we devise a pupil-aware gradient-descent-based computer-generated holography algorithm that is supervised by a large-baseline target light field. Compared with relevant baseline approaches, our method demonstrates significant improvements in image quality and \'etendue in simulation and with an experimental holographic display prototype.</description>

      <title>ResEmoteNet: Bridging Accuracy and Loss Reduction in Facial Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The human face is a silent communicator, expressing emotions and thoughts through its facial expressions. With the advancements in computer vision in recent years, facial emotion recognition technology has made significant strides, enabling machines to decode the intricacies of facial cues. In this work, we propose ResEmoteNet, a novel deep learning architecture for facial emotion recognition designed with the combination of Convolutional, Squeeze-Excitation (SE) and Residual Networks. The inclusion of SE block selectively focuses on the important features of the human face, enhances the feature representation and suppresses the less relevant ones. This helps in reducing the loss and enhancing the overall model performance. We also integrate the SE block with three residual blocks that help in learning more complex representation of the data through deeper layers. We evaluated ResEmoteNet on four open-source databases: FER2013, RAF-DB, AffectNet-7 and ExpW, achieving accuracies of 79.79%, 94.76%, 72.39% and 75.67% respectively. The proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art models across all four databases. The source code for ResEmoteNet is available at https://github.com/ArnabKumarRoy02/ResEmoteNet.</description>

      <title>C-DiffSET: Leveraging Latent Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Image Translation with Confidence-Guided Reliable Object Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides robust environmental and temporal coverage (e.g., during clouds, seasons, day-night cycles), yet its noise and unique structural patterns pose interpretation challenges, especially for non-experts. SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.</description>
