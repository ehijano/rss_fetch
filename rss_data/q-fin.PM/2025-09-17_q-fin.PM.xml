      <title>DeltaHedge: A Multi-Agent Framework for Portfolio Options Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In volatile financial markets, balancing risk and return remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches often focus solely on equity allocation, overlooking the strategic advantages of options trading for dynamic risk hedging. This work presents DeltaHedge, a multi-agent framework that integrates options trading with AI-driven portfolio management. By combining advanced reinforcement learning techniques with an ensembled options-based hedging strategy, DeltaHedge enhances risk-adjusted returns and stabilizes portfolio performance across varying market conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DeltaHedge outperforms traditional strategies and standalone models, underscoring its potential to transform practical portfolio management in complex financial environments. Building on these findings, this paper contributes to the fields of quantitative finance and AI-driven portfolio optimization by introducing a novel multi-agent system for integrating options trading strategies, addressing a gap in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Income Disaster, Role of Income Support, and Optimal Retirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12874v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interactions among consumption/savings, investment, and retirement choices with income disaster. We consider low-income people who are exposed to income disaster so that they retire involuntarily when income disaster occurs. The government provides extra income support to low-income retirees who suffer from significant income gaps. We demonstrate that the decision to enter retirement in the event of income disaster depends crucially on the level of income support. In particular, we quantitatively identify a certain income support level below which the optimal decision is to delay retirement. This implies that availability of the government's extra income support can be particularly important for the low-income people to achieve optimal retirement with income disaster.</description>

      <title>Myopic Optimality: why reinforcement learning portfolio management strategies lose money</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myopic optimization (MO) outperforms reinforcement learning (RL) in portfolio management: RL yields lower or negative returns, higher variance, larger costs, heavier CVaR, lower profitability, and greater model risk. We model execution/liquidation frictions with mark-to-market accounting. Using Malliavin calculus (Clark-Ocone/BEL), we derive policy gradients and risk shadow price, unifying HJB and KKT. This gives dual gap and convergence results: geometric MO vs. RL floors. We quantify phantom profit in RL via Malliavin policy-gradient contamination analysis and define a control-affects-dynamics (CAD) premium of RL indicating plausibly positive.</description>

      <title>Robust forward investment and consumption under drift and volatility uncertainties: A randomization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies robust forward investment and consumption preferences and optimal strategies for a risk-averse and ambiguity-averse agent in an incomplete financial market with drift and volatility uncertainties. We focus on non-zero volatility and constant relative risk aversion forward preferences. Given the non-convexity of the Hamiltonian with respect to uncertain volatilities, we first construct robust randomized forward preferences through endogenous randomization in an auxiliary market. {Therein, w}e derive the corresponding optimal and robust investment and consumption strategies. Furthermore, we show that such forward preferences and strategies, developed in the auxiliary market, remain optimal and robust in the physical market, offering a comprehensive {analysis} for forward investment and consumption under model uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Through the Looking Glass: Bitcoin Treasury Companies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bitcoin treasury companies have taken stock markets by storm amassing billions of dollars worth of tokens in hundreds of entities. The paper discusses, how leverage - whether created through corporate debt or investors using stock as loan collateral - fuels this trend. The extension of the binary-choice Kelly criterion to incorporate uncertainty in the form of the Kullback-Leibler divergence or more generally Bregman divergence is also briefly discussed.</description>
