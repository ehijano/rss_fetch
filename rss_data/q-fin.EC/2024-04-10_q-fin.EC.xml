      <title>Do Productivity Shocks Cause Inputs Misallocation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how productivity dispersion relates to input misallocation using a model with staggered productivity shocks that create wedges between anticipated and realized productivity for any production input. With inputs allocated optimally ex ante but suboptimally ex post, dispersion in realized productivity contributes to ex post input misallocation. Analyzing European firm data from 2000-2017 reveals significant co-movement between productivity dispersion and capital/labor misallocation across industries. Productivity dispersion explains a substantial share of capital and labor misallocation (40% and 70%), and 10% of materials misallocation, confirming its key role in allocation frictions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Ad Auction Realism: Practical Insights &amp; Modeling Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contemporary real-world online ad auctions differ from canonical models [Edelman et al., 2007; Varian, 2009] in at least four ways: (1) values and click-through rates can depend upon users' search queries, but advertisers can only partially "tune" their bids to specific queries; (2) advertisers do not know the number, identity, and precise value distribution of competing bidders; (3) advertisers only receive partial, aggregated feedback, and (4) payment rules are only partially known to bidders. These features make it virtually impossible to fully characterize equilibrium bidding behavior. This paper shows that, nevertheless, one can still gain useful insight into modern ad auctions by modeling advertisers as agents governed by an adversarial bandit algorithm, independent of auction mechanism intricacies. To demonstrate our approach, we first simulate "soft-floor" auctions [Zeithammer, 2019], a complex, real-world pricing rule for which no complete equilibrium characterization is known. We find that (i) when values and click-through rates are query-dependent, soft floors can improve revenues relative to standard auction formats even if bidder types are drawn from the same distribution; and (ii) with distributional asymmetries that reflect relevant real-world scenario, we find that soft floors yield lower revenues than suitably chosen reserve prices, even restricting attention to a single query. We then demonstrate how to infer advertiser value distributions from observed bids for a variety of pricing rules, and illustrate our approach with aggregate data from an e-commerce website.</description>
