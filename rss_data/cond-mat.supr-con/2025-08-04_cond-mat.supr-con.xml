      <title>Uniform electronic states and $s$-wave superconductivity in a strongly disordered high-entropy compound (RuRhPdIr)$_{0.6}$Pt$_{0.4}$Sb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-entropy compounds, where multiple elements occupy a single crystallographic site in a highly disordered manner, challenge conventional understandings of electronic structure based on periodicity and well-defined band dispersion. Here, we report a detailed nuclear magnetic resonance study of the high-entropy superconductor (RuRhPdIr)$_{0.6}$Pt$_{0.4}$Sb, revealing a spatially homogeneous electronic environment in the normal state, in stark contrast to its crystallographically disordered lattice. The superconducting state exhibits a small but solid Hebel-Slichter coherence peak followed by a significant decrease in the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate, providing compelling evidence for fully gapped $s$-wave pairing. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of superconductivity in highly disordered quantum materials but also open a new pathway for exploring novel superconducting states in entropy-stabilized systems.</description>

      <title>Gapless superconductivity from extremely dilute magnetic disorder in 2H-NbSe2-xSx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most superconducting materials exhibit a vanishing density of states at the Fermi level and Anderson's theorem posits that the superconducting gap is robust against nonmagnetic disorder. Although dilute magnetic impurities lead to localized in-gap states, these states typically have no bearing on the material's bulk superconducting properties. However, numerous experiments reveal a finite density of states at the Fermi level in systems with an apparently negligible number of magnetic impurities. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy and self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations, we find that gapless superconductivity emerges in 2H-NbSe2-xSx at remarkably low magnetic impurity concentrations. Furthermore, our density functional theory calculations and in-gap quasiparticle interference measurements demonstrate that the Se-S substitution significantly modifies the band structure. This modification favours nesting and dictates the in-gap scattering for x&gt;0, in stark contrast to the dominant charge density wave interactions in pure 2H-NbSe2. Our findings reveal an unusual superconducting response to disorder and highlight the importance of incorporating material-specific band structures in the understanding of a superconductor's response to even very low concentrations of magnetic impurities.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Theory of hybrid collective excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a linear response theory for the dynamical proximity effect in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) hybrid structures. Our approach combines the nonequilibrium quasiclassical Keldysh-Usadel equations for the electronic Green's functions in the TS with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation governing the magnetization dynamics in the FI. Within this framework, we study the proximity-induced coupling between magnons and superconducting collective excitations. We find that the spin-momentum locking intrinsic to the surface state of the TS leads to a hybridization between the superconducting Nambu-Goldstone (phase) collective mode and magnons, resulting in the emergence of composite magnon-Nambu-Goldstone excitations. The dependence of the coupling strength on relevant physical parameters is analyzed both analytically and numerically. In contrast, we show that the Higgs (amplitude) mode does not couple to magnons at linear order and therefore does not participate in the formation of hybrid collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Triplet correlations in superconductor/antiferromagnet heterostructures: dependence on type of antiferromagnetic ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a number of studies have predicted the emergence of a nontrivial proximity effect in superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) heterostructures. This effect is of considerable interest for the efficient integration of antiferromagnetic materials into the fields of superconducting spintronics and electronics. A key element of this proximity effect is the Neel triplet correlations, initially predicted for S/AF heterostructures with checkerboard G-type antiferromagnetic ordering. However, various forms of antiferromagnetic ordering exist, and an important open question concerns the generalization of these results to such cases. In this paper, we develop a theory of the proximity effect in S/AF heterostructures with arbitrary two-sublattice antiferromagnetic ordering, aiming to clarify which antiferromagnets are capable of inducing triplet correlations and what structure these correlations may exhibit. We show that, in S/AF heterostructures with collinear compensated antiferromagnets, the dominant superconducting triplet correlations are of the checkerboard Neel type, as originally predicted for G-type antiferromagnets. In contrast, layered Neel triplet correlations, although potentially generated by layered antiferromagnets, are significantly weaker. Consequently, in S/AF heterostructures with layered antiferromagnetic ordering, the proximity-induced triplet correlations may exhibit either a checkerboard Neel or a conventional ferromagnetic structure, depending on the specific antiferromagnet and its orientation relative to the S/AF interface.</description>

      <title>Large phonon-drag thermopower polarity reversal in Ba-doped KTaO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study reports the observation of phonon-drag thermopower polarity reversal in Ba-doped KTaO3 thin films, mediated by electron-phonon Umklapp scattering. Epitaxial films with distinct carrier concentrations (3.7 x 10^20 cm^-3 and 4.9 x 10^19 cm^-3) were grown via molecular-beam epitaxy. In heavily doped samples, where the Fermi surface spans 80% of the Brillouin zone, the Umklapp condition is satisfied, reversing electron momentum. This manifests as a sign-reversal in the thermopower around 80 K upon cooling despite the sample having only n-type carriers. On the other hand, the lightly doped sample (4.9 x 10^19 cm^-3) exhibits only a negative thermopower down to 2 K. These results advance the understanding of Umklapp electron-phonon drag in oxides and highlight KTaO3's potential for engineering unconventional thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Localized states and skin effect around non-Hermitian impurities in tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the generalized Bloch theorem formalism of Alase {\it et al.} [{\it Phys. Rev. Lett.} {\bf 117} 076804 (2016)] to analyze simple one-dimensional tight-binding lattice systems connected by Hermitian bonds (all with the same hopping parameter $t$), but containing one bond impurity which can be either Hermitian or non-Hermitian. We calculate the band structure, the bulk-boundary correspondence indicator ($D_L(\epsilon)$) and analyze the eigenvalues of the lattice translation operator ($z$), for each eigenstate. From the $z$ values the generalized Brillouin zone can be reconstructed. If the impurity is Hermitian (and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric), we find a parameter regime in which two localized edge states separate from the tight-binding band. We then simulate a non-Hermitian impurity by keeping hopping in one direction of the bond impurity the same as the rest of the tight-binding system, and varying only its reciprocal. Again, we find a region with localized edge states, but in this case the energy eigenvalues are purely imaginary. We also find that in this case the two zero energy eigenvectors coalesce, hence this system is an exceptional line. We then perform an interpolative scan between the above two scenarios and find that there is an intermediate region exhibiting a non-Hermitian skin effect. In this region a macroscopic fraction of states acquire complex energy eigenvalues and exhibit localization towards the impurity. Our numerical results are supported by a detailed analysis of the solutions of the boundary/impurity equation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Doping on the phase stability and Superconductivity in LaH10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational investigation into the effects of chemical doping with 15 different elements on phase stability and superconductivity in the LaH10 structure. Most doping elements were found to induce softening of phonon modes, enhancing electron-phonon coupling and improving critical superconducting temperature while weakening dynamical stability. Unlike these dopants, Ce was found to extend the range of dynamical stability for LaH10 by eliminating the van Hove singularity near the Fermi level. The doped compound, La0.75Ce0.25H10, maintains high-temperature superconductivity. We also demonstrate that different Ce doping configurations in the LaH10 structure have a minimal effect on energetic stability and electron-phonon coupling strength. Our findings suggest that Ce is a promising dopant to stabilize LaH10 at lower pressures while preserving its high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Collapse of density wave and emergence of superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ evidenced by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates realize a rare category of superconductors. However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cells limits spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa where structural transition appears. In addition, the observation of a single density wave gap indicates that the spin density wave and charge density wave remain coupled as pressure increases, rather than decoupling. After the density wave collapse, a distinct low-temperature regime emerges, characterized by a small gap consistent with potential superconducting pairing. The separated phase region of superconductivity and density waves suggests that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</description>

      <title>Time-tagging data acquisition system for testing superconducting electronics based on an RFSoC and custom analog frontend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel electronic devices can often be operated in a plethora of ways, which makes testing circuits comprised of them difficult. Often, no single tool can simultaneously analyze the operating margins, maximum speed, and failure modes of a circuit, particularly when the intended behavior of subcomponents of the circuit is not standardized. This work demonstrates a cost-effective time-domain data acquisition system for electronic circuits that enables more intricate verification techniques than are practical with conventional experimental setups. We use high-speed digital-to-analog converters and real-time multi-gigasample-per-second waveform processing to push experimental circuits beyond their maximum operating speed. Our custom time-tagging data capture firmware reduces memory requirements and can be used to determine when errors occur. The firmware is combined with a thermal-noise-limited analog frontend with \ensuremath{{50}\,\mathrm{dB}} of dynamic range. Compared to currently available commercial test equipment that is seven times more expensive, this data acquisition system was able to operate a superconducting shift register at a nearly three-times-higher clock frequency (${200}\,\mathrm{MHz}$ vs. ${80}\,\mathrm{MHz}$)</description>
