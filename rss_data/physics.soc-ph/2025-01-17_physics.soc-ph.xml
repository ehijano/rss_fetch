      <title>The Science of Urban Metabolism and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the quantitative patterns behind scientific disciplines is fundamental for informed research policy. While many fields have been studied from this perspective, Urban Science (USc) and its subfields remain underexplored. As organisms, urban systems rely on materials and energy inputs and transformation (i.e. metabolism) to sustain essential dynamics. This concept has been adopted by various disciplines, including architecture and sociology, and by those focused on metabolic processes, such as ecology and industrial ecology. This study addresses the structure and evolution of Urban Metabolism (UM) and Sustainability research, analyzing articles by disciplines, study subjects (e.g., cities, regions), methodologies, and author diversity (nationality and gender). Our review suggests that UM is an emerging field that grew until 2019, primarily addressed by environmental science and ecology. Common methods include Ecological Network Analysis, and Life Cycle Assessment, and Material Flow Analysis, focusing flows over stocks, ecosystem dynamics and evolutionary perspectives of the urban system. Authors are predominantly from China and the USA, and there are less gender gaps compared to general science research. Our analysis identifies relevant challenges that have become evident in the statistical properties of this scientific field and which might be helpful for the design of improved research policies.</description>

      <title>Measuring net effects in signed ecological and social network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With improvements in data resolution and quality, researchers can now construct detailed representations of complex systems as signed, weighted, and directed networks. In this article, we introduce a framework for measuring net and indirect effects without simplifying these information-rich networks. Building on a generalization of Katz centrality, this framework captures both direct and indirect interactions, the effect of the whole network on a node and its reverse, the effect of a node on the whole network, while accommodating the complexity of signed, weighted, and directed edges.
  To contextualize our contribution, we propose a taxonomy that unifies existing approaches and measures from the literature. We then apply our measure to ecological networks, where net and indirect effects remain critical yet difficult to quantify factors influencing coexistence. Specifically, we observe a strong correlation between negative net effects and species extinction in generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics. Additionally, we test our framework on a real-world social network, where it effectively identifies informative importance rankings, providing insights into influence propagation and power dynamics.</description>

      <title>Community attitudes towards the environmental cost of computational fluid dynamics research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations underpin much fluid dynamics research today. Such simulations often rely on large scale high performance computing (HPC) systems, and have a significant carbon footprint. Increasing the efficiency of data centers or the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources can lessen the environmental impact of scientific computing to a degree, but the attitudes of researchers also play a role. There are many choices researchers make which influence the carbon footprint of simulations. To change behaviours around simulation use, it is first necessary to understand attitudes toward them. Here, we present a case study on fluid dynamics researchers based in the University of Manchester, UK. We find a low awareness of the carbon footprint of computations, compounded by a lack of knowledge of the specific hardware used to run simulations. There is a discrepancy between researchers self-declared attitudes towards reducing the carbon footprint of their work, and their actions and choices. Overall, researchers did not consider carbon footprint as important in their decision making, and we found no correlation between the impact and carbon cost of simulations. Improved education and awareness of the environmental impact of simulations is imperative in the interests of the sustainability of this field.</description>

      <title>CrowdEgress: A Multi-Agent Simulation Platform for Pedestrian Crowd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a simulation platform to study complex crowd behavior in social context. The agent-based model is extended based on the social force model, and it mainly describes how agents interact with each other, and also with surrounding facilities such as walls, doors and exits. The simulation platform is compatible to FDS+Evac, and the input data in FDS+Evac could be imported into our simulation platform to create single-floor compartment geometry, and a flow solver is used to generate the roadmap towards exits. Most importantly, we plan to integrate advanced social and psychological theory into our simulation platform, especially investigating human behavior in emergency evacuation,such as pre-evacuation behavior, exit-selection activities, social group and herding effect and so forth.</description>

      <title>Nucleation transitions in polycontextural networks toward consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, we proposed polycontextural networks as a model of evolving systems of interacting beliefs. Here, we present an analysis of the phase transition as well as the scaling properties. The model contains interacting agents that strive for consensus, each with only subjective perception. Depending on a parameter that governs how responsive the agents are to changing their belief systems the model exhibits a phase transition that mediates between an active phase where the agents constantly change their beliefs and a frozen phase, where almost no changes appear. We observe the build-up of convention-aligned clusters only in the intermediate regime of diverging susceptibility. Here, we analyze in detail the behavior of polycontextural networks close to this transition. We provide an analytical estimate of the critical point and show that the scaling properties and the space-time structure of these clusters show self-similar behavior. Our results not only contribute to a better understanding of the emergence of consensus in systems of distributed beliefs but also show that polycontextural networks are models, motivated by social systems, where susceptibility -- the sensitivity to change own beliefs -- drives the growth of consensus clusters.</description>
