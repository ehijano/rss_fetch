      <title>Fault Tolerant Metric Dimensions of Leafless Cacti Graphs with Application in Supply Chain Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A resolving set for a simple graph $G$ is a subset of vertex set of $G$ such that it distinguishes all vertices of $G$ using the shortest distance from this subset. This subset is a metric basis if it is the smallest set with this property. A resolving set is a fault tolerant resolving set if the removal of any vertex from the subset still leaves it a resolving set. The smallest set satisfying this property is the fault tolerant metric basis, and the cardinality of this set is termed as fault tolerant metric dimension of $G$, denoted by $\beta'(G)$. In this article, we determine the fault tolerant metric dimension of bicyclic graphs of type-I and II and show that it is always $4$ for both types of graphs. We then use these results to form our basis to consider leafless cacti graphs, and calculate their fault tolerant metric dimensions in terms of \textit{inner cycles} and \textit{outer cycles}. We then consider a detailed real world example of supply and distribution center management, and discuss the application of fault tolerant metric dimension in such a scenario. We also briefly discuss some other scenarios where leafless cacti graphs can be used to model real world problems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Incremental Voting on Expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pull voting is a random process in which vertices of a connected graph have initial opinions chosen from a set of $k$ distinct opinions, and at each step a random vertex alters its opinion to that of a randomly chosen neighbour. If the system reaches a state where each vertex holds the same opinion, then this opinion will persist forthwith.
  In general the opinions are regarded as incommensurate, whereas in this paper we consider a type of pull voting suitable for integer opinions such as $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$ which can be compared on a linear scale; for example, 1 ('disagree strongly'), 2 ('disagree'), $\ldots,$ 5 ('agree strongly'). On observing the opinion of a random neighbour, a vertex updates its opinion by a discrete change towards the value of the neighbour's opinion, if different.
  Discrete incremental voting is a pull voting process which mimics this behaviour. At each step a random vertex alters its opinion towards that of a randomly chosen neighbour; increasing its opinion by $+1$ if the opinion of the chosen neighbour is larger, or decreasing its opinion by $-1$, if the opinion of the neighbour is smaller. If initially there are only two adjacent integer opinions, for example $\{0,1\}$, incremental voting coincides with pull voting, but if initially there are more than two opinions this is not the case.
  For an $n$-vertex graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\lambda$ be the absolute second eigenvalue of the transition matrix $P$ of a simple random walk on $G$. Let the initial opinions of the vertices be chosen from $\{1,2,\ldots,k\}$. Let $c=\sum_{v \in V} \pi_v X_v$, where $X_v$ is the initial opinion of vertex $v$, and $\pi_v$ is the stationary distribution of the vertex. Then provided $\lambda k=o(1)$ and $k=o(n/\log n)$, with high probability the final opinion is the initial weighted average $c$ suitably rounded to $\lfloor c \rfloor$ or $\lceil c\rceil$.</description>

      <title>Universal partial tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A De Bruijn cycle is a cyclic sequence in which every word of length $n$ over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ appears exactly once. De Bruijn tori are a two-dimensional analogue. Motivated by recent progress on universal partial cycles and words, which shorten De Bruijn cycles using a wildcard character, we introduce universal partial tori and matrices. We find them computationally and construct infinitely many of them using one-dimensional variants of universal cycles, including a new variant called a universal partial family.</description>

      <title>List Conflict-free Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by its application in the frequency assignment problem for cellular networks, conflict-free coloring was first studied by Even et al. in [Conflict-free colorings of simple geometric regions with applications to frequency assignment in cellular networks, SIAM Journal on Computing, 2004]. A \emph{conflict-free coloring} of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of colors to the vertex set of $\mathcal{H}$ such that every hyperedge in $\mathcal{H}$ has a vertex whose color is distinct from every other vertex in that hyperedge. The minimum number of colors required for such a coloring is known as the \emph{conflict-free chromatic number} of $\mathcal{H}$. Conflict-free coloring has also been studied on open/closed neighborhood hypergraphs of a given graph.
  In this paper, we study the list variant of conflict-free coloring where, for every vertex $v$, we are given a list of admissible colors $L_v$ such that $v$ is allowed to be colored only from $L_v$. We prove upper bounds for the list conflict-free chromatic number of general hypergraphs and graphs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Value Iteration for Parity Games: Strategy Iteration with Universal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (STOC 2017). The combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski et al. (SODA 2019). By proving a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of a universal tree, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial running time. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.
  As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of 1-player games. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (LICS 2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (ICALP 2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n \log d)$ respectively per iteration.</description>

      <title>The clique chromatic number of sparse random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The clique chromatic number of a graph is the smallest number of colors in a vertex coloring so that no maximal clique is monochromatic. In this paper, we determine the order of magnitude of the clique chromatic number of the random graph G_{n,p} for most edge-probabilities p in the range n^{-2/5} \ll p \ll 1. This resolves open problems and questions of Lichev, Mitsche and Warnke as well as Alon and Krievelevich.
  One major proof difficulty stems from high-degree vertices, which prevent maximal cliques in their neighborhoods: we deal with these vertices by an intricate union bound argument, that combines the probabilistic method with new degree counting arguments in order to enable Janson's inequality. This way we determine the asymptotics of the clique chromatic number of G_{n,p} in some ranges, and discover a surprising new phenomenon that contradicts earlier predictions for edge-probabilities p close to n^{-2/5}.</description>

      <title>A Deceptively Simple Quadratic Recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard techniques for treating linear recurrences no longer apply for quadratic recurrences. It is not hard to determine asymptotics for a specific parametrized model over a wide domain of values (all $p \neq 1/2$ here). The gap between theory and experimentation seems insurmountable, however, at a single outlier ($p = 1/2$).</description>
