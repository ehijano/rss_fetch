      <title>Critical behavior and multistability in quasi-two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) turbulence, despite being an idealization of real flows, is of fundamental interest as a model of the spontaneous emergence of order from chaotic flows. The emergence of order often displays critical behavior, whose study is hindered by the long spatial and temporal scales involved. Here, we experimentally study turbulence in periodically driven nanofluidic channels with a high aspect ratio using superfluid helium. We find a multistable transition behavior resulting from cascading bifurcations of large-scale vorticity and critical behavior at the transition to quasi-2D turbulence consistent with phase transitions in periodically driven many-body systems. We demonstrate that quasi-2D turbulent systems can undergo an abrupt change in response to a small change in a control parameter, consistent with predictions for large-scale atmospheric or oceanic flows.</description>

      <title>Canard explosions in turbulent thermo-fluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sudden transition to a state of high amplitude limit cycle oscillations is catastrophic in a thermo-fluid system. Conventionally, upon varying the control parameter, a sudden transition is observed as an abrupt jump in the amplitude of the fluctuations in these systems. In contrast, we present an experimental discovery of a canard explosion in a turbulent reactive flow system where we observe a continuous bifurcation with a rapid rise in the amplitude of the fluctuations within a narrow range of control parameters. The observed transition is facilitated via a state of bursting, consisting of the epochs of large amplitude periodic oscillations amidst the epochs of low amplitude periodic oscillations. The amplitude of the bursts is higher than the amplitude of the bursts of intermittency state in a conventional gradual transition, as reported in turbulent reactive flow systems. During the bursting state, we observe that temperature fluctuations of exhaust gas vary at a slower time scale in correlation with the amplitude envelope of the bursts. We also present a phenomenological model for thermoacoustic systems to describe the observed canard explosion. Using the model, we explain that the large amplitude bursts occur due to the slow-fast dynamics at the bifurcation regime of the canard explosion.</description>

      <title>Chemical Timescale Effects on Detonation Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of detonation-containing flows have emerged as crucial tools for designing next-generation power and propulsion devices. As these tools mature, it is important for the combustion community to properly understand and isolate grid resolution effects when simulating detonations. To this end, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of the numerical convergence of unsteady detonation simulations, with focus on isolating the impacts of chemical timescale modifications on convergence characteristics in the context of operator splitting. With the aid of an adaptive mesh refinement based flow solver, the convergence analysis is conducted using two kinetics configurations: (1) a simplified three-step model mechanism, in which chemical timescales in the detonation are modified by adjusting activation energies, and (2) a detailed hydrogen mechanism, in which chemical timescales are adjusted through ambient pressure modifications. The convergence of unsteady self-sustained detonations in one-dimensional channels is then analyzed with reference to steady-state theoretical baseline solutions using these mechanisms. The goal of the analysis is to provide a detailed comparison of the effects of grid resolution on both macroscopic (peak pressures and detonation wave speeds) and microscopic (detonation wave structure) quantities of interest, drawing connections between the deviations from steady-state baselines and minimum chemical timescales. This work uncovers resolution-dependent unsteady detonation regimes, and highlights the important role played by not only the chemical timescales, but also the ratio between chemical and induction timescales in the detonation wave structure on simulation convergence properties.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Implicit Advection for Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit time-stepping for advection is applied locally in space and time where Courant numbers are large, but standard explicit time-stepping is used for the remaining solution which is typically the majority. This adaptively implicit advection scheme facilitates efficient and robust integrations with long time-steps while having negligible impact on the overall accuracy, and achieving monotonicity and local conservation on general meshes. A novel and important aspect for the efficiency of the approach is that only one linear solver iteration is needed for each advection solve.
  The implementation in this paper uses a second-order Runge-Kutta implicit/explicit time-stepping in combination with a second/third-order finite volume spatial discretisation. We demonstrate the adaptively implicit advection in the context of deformational flow advection on the sphere and a fully compressible model for atmospheric flows. Tracers are advected over the poles of latitude-longitude grids with very large Courant numbers and through hexagonal and cubed-sphere meshes with the same algorithm. Buoyant flow simulations with strong local updrafts also benefit from adaptively implicit advection. Stably stratified flow simulations require a stable combination of implicit treatment of gravity and acoustic waves as well as advection in order to achieve long stable time-steps.</description>

      <title>Scaling Analysis of the Swirling Wake of a Porous Disc: Application to Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive study of the wake of a porous disc, the design of which has been modified to incorporate a swirling motion at an inexpensive cost. The swirl intensity is passively controlled by varying the internal disc geometry, i.e. the pitch angle of the blades. A swirl number is introduced to characterise the competition between the linear (drag) and the azimuthal (swirl) momentums on the wake recovery. Assuming that swirl dominates the near wake and non-equilibrium turbulence theory applies, new scaling laws of the mean wake properties are derived. To assess these theoretical predictions, an in-depth analysis of the aerodynamics of these original porous discs has been conducted experimentally. It is found that at the early stage of wake recovery, the swirling motion induces a low-pressure core, which controls the mean velocity deficit properties. The measurements collected in the swirling wake of the porous discs support the new scaling laws proposed in this work. Finally, it is shown that, as far as swirl is injected in the wake, the characteristics of the mean velocity deficit profiles match very well those of both lab-scale and real-scale wind turbine data extracted from the literature. Overall, our results emphasise that by setting the initial conditions of the wake recovery, swirl is a key ingredient to be taken into account in order to faithfully replicate the mean wake of wind turbines.</description>

      <title>Expressing turbulent kinetic energy as coarse-grained enstrophy or strain deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In turbulent flows, the element of fluid gets deformed by chaotic motion due to the formation of sharp velocity gradients. A direct connection between the element of fluid stresses and the energy balance still remains elusive. Here, an exact identity of incompressible turbulence is derived linking the velocity gradient norm across the scales to the total kinetic energy. In the context of three dimensional (3D) homogeneous turbulence, this relation can be specialised obtaining the expression of total kinetic energy decomposed either in terms of fluid element deformations due to strain motion or via the resolved scale enstrophy. Applied to data from direct numerical simulations (DNS), the decomposition reveals that, beyond the scales dominated by the external forcing, extensional and contractile deformations account approximately for 53% and 40% of the kinetic energy of the associated scale saturating to these values at the small scales; the remaining 7% is carried by the sign-indefinite one. From both these two identities one can derive an exact expression of the omni-directional energy spectrum which is formulated via an ultraviolet-infrared mixing of scales. Data from DNS indicated that this formulation of the energy spectrum reproduces both analytically and numerically the power-law behaviour of the well known Kolmogorov spectral scaling.</description>

      <title>Field investigation of 3D snow settling dynamics under weak atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on settling dynamics of snow particles, considering their complex morphologies and real atmospheric conditions, remains scarce despite extensive simulations and laboratory studies. Our study bridges the gap through a comprehensive field investigation into the three-dimensional (3D) snow settling dynamics under weak atmospheric turbulence, enabled by a 3D particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) system to record &gt; a million trajectories, coupled with a snow particle analyzer for simultaneous aerodynamic property characterization of four distinct snow types (aggregates, graupels, dendrites, needles). Our findings indicate that while the terminal velocity predicted by the aerodynamic model aligns well with PTV-measured settling velocity for graupels, significant discrepancies arise for non-spherical particles, particularly dendrites, which exhibit higher drag coefficients than predicted. Qualitative observations of 3D settling trajectories highlight pronounced meandering in aggregates and dendrites, in contrast to the subtler meandering observed in needles and graupels, attributable to their smaller frontal areas. This meandering in aggregates and dendrites occurs at lower frequencies compared to that of graupels. Further quantification of trajectory acceleration and curvature suggests that the meandering frequencies in aggregates and dendrites are smaller than that of morphology-induced vortex shedding of disks, likely due to their rotational inertia, and those of graupels align with the small-scale atmospheric turbulence. Moreover, our analysis of vertical acceleration along trajectories elucidates that the orientation changes in dendrites and aggregates enhance their settling velocity. Such insights into settling dynamics refine models of snow settling velocity under weak atmospheric turbulence, with broader implications for more accurately predicting ground snow accumulation.</description>

      <title>Boundary sources of velocity gradient tensor and its invariants: a unified theory of boundary vorticity and vortex dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work elucidates the boundary behaviors of the velocity gradient tensor ($\bm{A}\equiv\bm{\nabla}\bm{u}$) and its principal invariants ($P,Q,R$) for compressible flow interacting with a stationary rigid wall. Firstly, it is found that the well-known Caswell formula exhibits an inherent physical structure being compatible with the normal-nilpotent decomposition, where both the strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors contain the physical effects from the spin component of the vorticity. Secondly, we derive the kinematic and dynamic forms of the boundary $\bm{A}$-flux from which the known boundary fluxes can be recovered by applying the symmetric-antisymmetric decomposition. Then, we obtain the explicit expression of the boundary $Q$ flux as a result of the competition among the boundary fluxes of squared dilatation, enstrophy and squared strain-rate. Importantly, we emphasize that both the coupling between the spin and surface pressure gradient, and the spin-curvature quadratic interaction, are \textit{not} responsible for the generation of the boundary $Q$ flux, although they contribute to both the boundary fluxes of enstrophy and squared strain-rate. Moreover, we prove that the boundary $R$ flux must vanish on a stationary rigid wall. Finally, the boundary fluxes of the invariants of the strain-rate and rotation-rate tensors are also discussed. It is revealed that the boundary flux of the third invariant of the strain-rate tensor is proportional to the wall-normal derivative of the vortex stretching term, which serves as a source term accounting for the the spatiotemporal evolution rate of the wall-normal enstrophy flux. These theoretical results provide a unified description of boundary vorticity and vortex dynamics, which could be valuable in understanding the formation mechanisms of complex near-wall coherent structures and the boundary sources of flow noise.</description>

      <title>Discovery of knowledge of wall-bounded turbulence via symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of high performance computer and experimental technology, the study of turbulence has accumulated a large number of high fidelity data. However, few general turbulence knowledge has been found from the data. So we use the symbolic regression(SR) method to find a new mixing length formula which is generally valid in wall-bounded turbulence, and this formula has physical interpretation that it has correct asymptotic relationships in viscous sublayer,buffer layer ,log-law region and outer region . Coupled with Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes(RANS) solver, we test several classic cases. The prediction results fully demonstrate the accuracy and generalization of the formula. So far, we have found that SR method can help us find general laws from complex turbulent systems, and it is expected that through this 'white box' machine learning method, more turbulence knowledge with physical interpretation can be found in the future.</description>

      <title>Topological water-wave structures manipulating particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological wave structures, such as vortices and skyrmions, appear in a variety of quantum and classical wave fields, including optics and acoustics. In particular, optical vortices have found numerous applications ranging from quantum information to astrophysics. Furthermore, both optical and acoustic structured waves are crucial for manipulation of small particles, from atoms to macroscopic biological objects. Here we report on the controllable generation of topological structures -- wave vortices, skyrmions, and polarization M\"{o}bius strips -- in interfering gravity water waves. Most importantly, we demonstrate efficient manipulation of subwavelength and wavelength-order floating particles with topologically structured water waves. This includes trapping of the particles in the high-intensity field zones, as well as controllable orbital and spinning motions due to the orbital and spin angular momenta of water waves. Our results reveal the water-wave counterpart of optical and acoustic manipulations, which paves the avenue for applications in hydrodynamics and microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic reconnection, plasmoids and numerical resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explaining fast magnetic reconnection in electrically conducting plasmas has been a theoretical challenge in plasma physics since its first description by Eugene N. Parker. In the recent years the observed reconnection rate has been shown by numerical simulations to be explained by the plasmoid instability that appears in highly conductive plasmas. In this work we show that the plasmoid instability is very sensitive to the numerical resolution used. It is shown that well resolved runs display no plasmoid instability even at Lundquist number as large as $5\cdot10^5$ achieved at resolutions of $32\,768^2$ grid points. On the contrary in simulations that are under-resolved below a threshold, the plasmoid instability manifests itself with the formation of larger plasmoids the larger the under-resolving is. The present results thus question the description of the plasmoid instability as a mechanism for fast magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Trapped Free Surface Waves for a Lamb-Oseen Vortex Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trapped surface waves have been observed in a swimming pool trapped by, and rotating around, the cores of vortices. To investigate this effect, we have numerically studied the free-surface response of a Lamb--Oseen vortex to small perturbations. The fluid has finite depth but is laterally unbounded. The numerical method used is spectrally accurate, and uses a novel non-reflecting buffer region to simulate a laterally unbounded fluid. While a variety of linear waves can arise in this flow, we focus here on surface gravity waves. We investigate the linear modes of the vortex as a function of the perturbation azimuthal mode number and the vortex rotation rate. We find that at low rotation rates, linear modes decay by radiating energy to the far field, while at higher rotation rates modes become nearly neutrally stable and trapped in the vicinity of the vortex. While trapped modes have previously been seen in shallow water surface waves due to small perturbations of a bathtub vortex, the situation considered here is qualitatively different owing to the lack of an inward flow and the dispersive nature of non-shallow-water waves. We also find that for slow vortex rotation rates, trapped waves propagate in the opposite direction to the vortex rotation, whereas, above a threshold rotation rate, waves co-rotate with the flow.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for prediction of vortex-induced vibration based on the nonlinear identification of general wake oscillator modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present novel identification strategies to develop a unified framework for vortex-induced vibration (VIV) prediction based on the general semi-empirical wake oscillator. Greybox nonlinear system identification method accompanying high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and/or experimental data could be applied for the identification process. The proposed template of general wake oscillators contains low- to high-order damping terms to be identified for characterizing the possible flow dynamics. Two different strategies, including individual identification of single wake oscillator and overall identification of coupled VIV control equations, are proposed. VIV system consisting of an elastically-mounted circular cylinder submerged in laminar flow at Reynold number of 100 is considered. Both strategies have been tested and have exhibited high accuracy. The second strategy, i.e., overall identification of coupled VIV control equations, would be more suitable for the future framework owing that its training process considers the effect of fluid damping. A detailed mathematical introduction to future works on framework development covering the wide Reynold number range is addressed. The proposed unified framework is a landmark update of past wake oscillators both in terms of prediction accuracy and physical principles and has considerable research significance and practical engineering value.</description>
