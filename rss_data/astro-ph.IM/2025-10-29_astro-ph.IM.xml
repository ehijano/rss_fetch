      <title>The case for an Astrometric Mission Extension of Euclid. Extending Gaia by 6 magnitudes with Euclid covering one-third of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nominal duration of Euclid's main mission is six years, but current best estimates indicate that the observatory has sufficient propellant to operate for up to ~14 years in total. In this work, we advocate dedicating six of these ~8 additional years to repeating the main survey, covering approximately one-third of the sky. This repetition would not only improve the sampling, signal-to-noise, quality, and depth of the survey, but -- most importantly -- would provide a six-year time baseline between two epochs if executed in the same sequence. The availability of multiple epochs would enable the derivation of proper motions for stars as faint as V~27, i.e., more than five magnitudes fainter than those measured by the Gaia mission. Although it may seem early to propose such a mission extension, in this work we quantitatively illustrate its immense scientific potential. We therefore intend to initiate the technical and scientific discussions early to ensure optimal planning. The here proposed extension would employ only the VIS channel -- owing to its superior astrometric capability and depth -- while simultaneously using NISP in slitless-spectroscopy mode to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of first-epoch spectra that would also benefit of proper motions to identify and reject objects within the local Universe.</description>

      <title>In Search of the Unknown Unknowns: A Multi-Metric Distance Ensemble for Out of Distribution Anomaly Detection in Astronomical Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single, user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find novelties.
  Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility.
  We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection -- anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy: https://github.com/sidchaini/distclassipy/, while all code to reproduce the results of this paper is available here: https://github.com/sidchaini/dimmad/.</description>

      <title>Magrathea v2: A planetary interior modeling platform in C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magrathea is an open-source C++ code for modeling the internal structure of differentiated planets. The initial release, Huang et al. (2022), introduced the base solver, a modular framework for defining equations of state (EOSs) used within phase diagrams for each differentiated layer, and outlined a series of planned extensions. Many of those updates are now implemented. Magrathea v2 is a more versatile platform that supports a winder range of compositions, adds new tools for composition retrieval, and makes it easier for users to adapt the code to their own models.</description>

      <title>Re-envisioning Euclid Galaxy Morphology: Identifying and Interpreting Features with Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can efficiently identify candidate monosemantic features from pretrained neural networks for galaxy morphology. We demonstrate this on Euclid Q1 images using both supervised (Zoobot) and new self-supervised (MAE) models. Our publicly released MAE achieves superhuman image reconstruction performance. While a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the supervised model primarily identifies features already aligned with the Galaxy Zoo decision tree, SAEs can identify interpretable features outside of this framework. SAE features also show stronger alignment than PCA with Galaxy Zoo labels. Although challenges in interpretability remain, SAEs provide a powerful engine for discovering astrophysical phenomena beyond the confines of human-defined classification.</description>

      <title>LBT Italia: Current Achievements and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) is a world-leading astronomical observatory, where the italian partnership has played an important role in increasing the telescope's productivity, both through an optimized observing strategy and through peer-reviewed publications that are well recognized by the international astronomical community. This manuscript provides an updated overview of the active and past instruments at LBT, together with the key usage statistics. In particular, we analyze the operational performance recorded in the LBT Italia night logs during INAF's observing time and assess the scientific impact of each instrument. Between 2014 and 2025 LBT Italia produced an average of 14 referred publication per year, based on an annual average of 311 hours of on-sky time. This corresponds to approximately 2.2 nights of telescope time per publication. The results of this analysis are placed in an international context to evaluate the competitiveness of LBT, and we outline future perspective for scientific exploitation.</description>

      <title>CSST Slitless Spectra: Target Detection and Classification with YOLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Addressing the spatial uncertainty and spectral blending challenges in CSST slitless spectroscopy, we present a deep learning-driven, end-to-end framework based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models. This approach directly detects, classifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing traditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both compact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded fields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy) and discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins), showcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing. Our framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial features holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection precision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned redshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a paradigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification, and preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system. Future research will concentrate on direct, continuous prediction of astrophysical parameters from raw spectral traces.</description>

      <title>Optimising Underwater Neutrino Telescopes for All-Flavour Point Source Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy neutrino astronomy has advanced rapidly in recent years, with IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD establishing a diffuse astrophysical flux and pointing to promising source candidates. These achievements mark the transition from first detections to detailed source studies, motivating next-generation detectors with larger volumes, improved angular resolution, and full neutrino-flavour sensitivity. We present a performance study of large underwater neutrino telescopes, taking the proposed TRIDENT array in the South China Sea as a case study, with a focus on comparing the performance of various detector configurations against the TRIDENT baseline design. Both track-like events primarily from muon neutrinos, which provide precise directional information, and cascade events from all flavours, which offer superior energy resolution, diffuse-source sensitivity, and all-sky flavour coverage, are included to achieve a balanced performance across source types. The time to discover potential astrophysical sources with both track- and cascade-like events is used as the figure of merit to compare a variety of detector design choices. Our results show that, for a fixed number of optical modules, simply enlarging the instrumented volume does not inherently lead to improved performance, while taller strings can provide modest gains across all detector channels, within engineering constraints. Distributing dense clusters of strings over a large volume is found to generally worsen discovery potential compared to the baseline layout. Finally, the optical properties of the sea-water emerge as the key factor dictating the optimisation of detector layout, highlighting the need for in-situ measurements and early deployment of optical modules to guide the final array configuration.</description>

      <title>Exascale In-situ visualization for Astronomy &amp; Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern simulations and observations in Astronomy &amp; Cosmology (A&amp;C) produce massively large data volumes, posing significant challenges for storage, access and data analysis. A long-standing bottleneck in high-performance computing, especially now in the exascale era, has been the requirement to write these large datasets to disks, which limits the performance. A promising solution to this challenge is in-situ processing, where analysis and visualization are performed concurrently with the simulation itself, bypassing the storage of the simulation data. In this work, we present new results from an approach for in-situ processing based on Hecuba, a framework that provides a highly distributed database for streaming A&amp;C simulation data directly into the visualization pipeline to make possible on-line visualization. By integrating Hecuba with the high-performance cosmological simulator ChaNGa, we enable real-time, in-situ visualization of N-body simulation results using tools such as ParaView and VisIVO.</description>

      <title>In-Situ High Performance Visualization for Astronomy &amp; Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Astronomy &amp; Cosmology (A&amp;C) community is presently witnessing an unprecedented growth in the quality and quantity of data coming from simulations and observations. Writing results of numerical simulations to disk files has long been a bottleneck in high-performance computing. To access effectively and extract the scientific content of such large-scale data sets appropriate tools and techniques are needed. This is especially true for visualization tools, where petascale data size problems cannot be visualized without some data filtering, which reduces either the resolution or the amount of data volume managed by the visualization tool.
  A solution to this problem is to run the analysis and visualization concurrently (in-situ) with the simulation and bypass the storage of the full results. In particular we use Hecuba, a framework offering a highly distributed database to stream A\&amp;C simulation data for on-line visualization. We will demonstrate the Hecuba platform integration with the Changa high performant cosmological simulator and the in-situ visualization of its N-body results with the ParaView and VisIVO tools.</description>

      <title>Giant Planet Evolution with MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of gaseous planets is a complex process influenced by various physical parameters and processes. In this study, we present critical modifications to the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code to enhance its applicability to giant planet modelling. We introduce an equation of state specifically tailored for materials at planetary conditions. The equation of state considers the thermodynamic properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures and heavy elements, improving the accuracy of internal structure calculations. We also present modifications to the radiative opacity to allow the modelling of grains, clouds and opacity windows. Furthermore, we refine the treatment of convective mixing processes in MESA to better replicate convective mixing with the presence of composition gradients. Finally, we add a treatment for helium rain and settling. These modifications aim to enhance the predictive capabilities of MESA for giant planet evolution and are publicly available. We hope that these improvements will lead to a deeper understanding of giant planet evolution in the solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity to Sub-Io-sized Exosatellite Transits in the MIRI LRS Lightcurve of the Nearest Substellar Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST's unprecedented sensitivity enables precise spectrophotometric monitoring of substellar worlds, revealing atmospheric variability driven by mechanisms operating across different pressure levels. This same precision now permits exceptionally sensitive searches for transiting exosatellites, small terrestrial companions to these worlds. Using a novel simultaneous dual-band search method to address host variability, we present a search for transiting exosatellites in an 8-hour JWST/MIRI LRS lightcurve of the nearby ($2.0\,pc$) substellar binary WISE J1049-5319AB, composed of two $\sim30 M_{\rm Jup}$ brown dwarfs separated by $3.5\,au$ and viewed near edge-on. Although we detect no statistically significant transits, our injection-recovery tests demonstrate sensitivity to satellites as small as $0.275\,R_{\oplus}$ ($0.96\,R_{\rm Io}$ or $\sim$1 lunar radius), corresponding to 300ppm transit depths, and satellite-to-host mass ratios $&gt;$$10^{-6}$. This approach paves the way for detecting Galilean-moon analogs around directly imaged brown dwarfs, free-floating planets, and wide-orbit exoplanets, dozens of which are already scheduled for JWST lightcurve monitoring. In our Solar System, each giant planet hosts on average 3.5 moons above this threshold, suggesting that JWST now probes a regime where such companions are expected to be abundant. The technique and sensitivities demonstrated here mark a critical step toward detecting exosatellites and ultimately enabling constraints on the occurrence rates of small terrestrial worlds orbiting $1\text{-}70$$M_{\rm Jup}$ hosts.</description>

      <title>ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz) and S250818k: A Candidate Superkilonova from a Sub-threshold Sub-Solar Gravitational Wave Trigger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported gravitational waves from a sub-threshold binary neutron star merger. If astrophysical, this event would have a surprisingly low chirp mass, suggesting that at least one neutron star was below a solar mass. The Zwicky Transient Facility mapped the coarse localization and discovered a transient, ZTF25abjmnps (AT2025ulz), that was spatially and temporally coincident with the gravitational wave trigger. The first week of follow-up suggested properties reminiscent of a GW170817-like kilonova. Subsequent follow-up suggests properties most similar to a young, stripped-envelope, Type IIb supernova. Although we cannot statistically rule out chance coincidence, we undertake due diligence analysis to explore the possible association between ZTF25abjmnps and S250818k. Theoretical models have been proposed wherein sub-solar neutron star(s) may form (and subsequently merge) via accretion disk fragmentation or core fission inside a core-collapse supernova i.e. a ``superkilonova". Here, we qualitatively discuss our multi-wavelength dataset in the context of the superkilonova picture. Future higher significance gravitational wave detections of sub-solar neutron star mergers with extensive electromagnetic follow-up would conclusively resolve this tantalizing multi-messenger association.</description>

      <title>Galactic Alchemy: Deep Learning Map-to-Map Translation in Hydrodynamical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first systematic study of multi-domain map-to-map translation in galaxy formation simulations, leveraging deep generative models to predict diverse galactic properties. Using high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical simulation data, we compare conditional generative adversarial networks and diffusion models under unified preprocessing and evaluation, optimizing architectures and attention mechanisms for physical fidelity on galactic scales. Our approach jointly addresses seven astrophysical domains - including dark matter, gas, neutral hydrogen, stellar mass, temperature, and magnetic field strength - while introducing physics-aware evaluation metrics that quantify structural realism beyond standard computer vision measures. We demonstrate that translation difficulty correlates with physical coupling, achieving near-perfect fidelity for mappings from gas to dark matter and mappings involving astro-chemical components such as total gas to HI content, while identifying fundamental challenges in weakly constrained tasks such as gas to stellar mass mappings. Our results establish GAN-based models as competitive counterparts to state-of-the-art diffusion approaches at a fraction of the computational cost (in training and inference), paving the way for scalable, physics-aware generative frameworks for forward modelling and observational reconstruction in the SKA era.</description>

      <title>Wind-AE: A Fast, Open-source 1D Photoevaporation Code with Metal and Multi-frequency X-ray Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout their lives, short period exoplanets (&lt;100 days) experience X-ray and extreme-UV (XUV) stellar irradiation that can heat and photoionize planets' upper atmospheres, driving transonic outflows. This photoevaporative mass loss plays a role in both evolution and observed demographics; however, mass loss rates are not currently directly observable and can only be inferred from models. To that end, we present an open-source fast 1D, XUV multi-frequency, multispecies, steady-state, hydrodynamic Parker Wind photoevaporation relaxation model based on Murray-Clay et al. (2009,arXiv:0811.0006). The model can move smoothly between high and low flux regimes and accepts custom multi-frequency stellar spectra. While the inclusion of high-energy X-rays increases mass loss rates ($\dot{M}$), metals decrease $\dot{M}$, and the net result for a typical hot Jupiter is a similar $\dot{M}$, but a hotter, faster, and more gradually ionized wind. We find that mulitfrequency photons (e.g., 13.6-2000eV) are absorbed over a broader range of heights in the atmosphere resulting in a wind-launch radius, $R_{XUV}$, that is of order 10 nanobars for all but the highest surface gravity planets. Grids of H/He solar metallicity atmospheres reveal that, for typical hot Jupiters like HD 209458b, $R_{XUV}$~1.1-1.8$R_P$ for low-fluxes, meaning that the energy-limited mass loss rate, $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R)$, computed at $R=R_P$ is a good approximation. However, for planets with low escape velocities, like many sub-Neptunes and super-Earths, $R_{XUV}$ can be &gt;&gt;$R_P$, making it necessary to use $\dot{M}_{Elim}(R=R_{XUV})$ to avoid significantly underestimating mass loss rates. For both high escape velocities and large incident fluxes, radiative cooling is significant and energy-limited mass loss overestimates $\dot{M}$.</description>

      <title>Tracing Cloud Formation and Evolution Through 3D Magnetic Field Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to use the unprecedented polarization sensitivity of PRIMA's PRIMAger Polarization Imager and its high resolution in Band 1 (92 $\mu$m) to map magnetic fields across two contrasting molecular cloud environments: the well-studied Perseus cloud and the isolated Musca filament. This comparative study will leverage the existing VLA radio observations that provide line-of-sight magnetic field component of the Perseus cloud, along with upcoming POSSUM survey results for Musca, to construct the first detailed 3D magnetic field vector maps at sub-parsec resolution. Perseus, with its known formation history through interstellar structure (e.g., bubble) interactions, will reveal how magnetic fields evolve during active star formation phases, while Musca, an isolated filament with lower star-formation activity, will show magnetic field morphology in early evolutionary stages. With PRIMA's resolution of 0.01 pc for Perseus and $&lt;0.01$ pc for Musca, we will resolve magnetic field structures at scales necessary for understanding cloud fragmentation and star formation efficiency, and the roles that magnetic fields play in these processes. Our survey will require approximately 1438 hours to cover 42 deg$^2$ of Perseus and 12 deg$^2$ of Musca. With this, we aim to provide the first comprehensive view of how environment and evolutionary state may influence magnetic field evolution in molecular clouds and how magnetic fields influence cloud formation, fragmentation, and star formation.</description>

      <title>Lunar Navigation System Optimization for Targeted Coverage with Semi-Analytical Station Keeping Model and Earth-GPS Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of an indigenous Lunar Navigation Satellite System (LNSS) is receiving growing attention due to the surge in planned lunar missions and the limited accessibility of Earth-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in the cislunar environment. Several studies have explored LNSS architecture using geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing LNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using analytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south pole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs) and lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with Earth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not been adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a comprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary multi-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar orbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation performance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous station-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS integration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse set of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV requirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen elliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with acceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less than 0.4 km/s per satellite per year. This represents a significant reduction in constellation size compared to previous studies, offering a cost-effective yet operationally efficient solution for future LNSS missions.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Synthetic Pretraining for Inference of Stellar Mass Embedded in Dense Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass is a fundamental quantity that determines the properties and evolution of stars. However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>LEVITAS: Levitodynamics for Accurate Individual Particle Sensing in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately observing the rarefied media of the upper atmosphere, exosphere, and planetary and solar system environments and beyond requires highly sensitive metrological techniques. We present the operating concept and architecture of an in-situ sensing solution based on the dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle (levitodynamics). It can detect and measure impacts of individual particles in rarefied media. Dubbed `LEVITAS', our sensor consists of a dispenser of dielectric nanoparticles and optical trapping of a single nanoparticle in the focus of a laser beam. The trapped nanoparticle constitutes a harmonic oscillator at frequencies in the kilohertz range whose position can be tracked at the standard quantum limit by interferometric detection of the laser photons it scatters. Here, we simulate microcanonical impacts on the nanoparticle and show that the density, velocity, temperature, and composition of the surrounding medium can be estimated accurately. We illustrate the performance of LEVITAS in circumstances ranging from low Earth orbit out to exospheric distances, across which individual impacts can be detected at favourable rates. Furthermore, LEVITAS may be employed to accurately measure highly rarefied neutral distributions within vastly different areas of momentum space. This we demonstrate by simulating the measurement of high-velocity neutral gas particles from the interstellar medium penetrating the heliosphere and flowing through our solar system.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with the COMCUBE-S CubeSat Swarm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: COMCUBE-S (Compton Telescope CubeSat Swarm) is a proposed mission aimed at understanding the radiation mechanisms of ultra-relativistic jets from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). It consists of a swarm of 16U CubeSats carrying a state-of-the-art Compton polarimeter and a BGO spectrometer to perform timing, spectroscopic and polarimetric measurements of the prompt emission from GRBs. The mission is currently in a feasibility study phase (Phase A) with the European Space Agency to prepare an in-orbit demonstration. Here, we present the simulation work used to optimise the design and operational concept of the microsatellite constellation, as well as estimate the mission performance in terms of GRB detection rate and polarimetry. We used the MEGAlib software to simulate the response function of the gamma-ray instruments, together with a detailed model for the background particle and radiation fluxes in low-Earth orbit. We also developed a synthetic GRB population model to best estimate the detection rate. These simulations show that COMCUBE-S will detect about 2 GRBs per day, which is significantly higher than that of all past and current GRB missions. Furthermore, simulated performance for linear polarisation measurements shows that COMCUBE-S will be able to uniquely distinguish between competing models of the GRB prompt emission, thereby shedding new light on some of the most fundamental aspects of GRB physics.</description>

      <title>A Deep Search for Exomoons Around WISE 0855 With JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is collecting time-series observations of many free-floating planets (FFPs) to study their weather, but these light curves are the ideal datasets to search for exomoons that transit the FFP during observations. In this paper, we present observations of the planetary-mass Y dwarf ($T=250-285K$, $M = 6.5\pm3.5 M_{Jup}$, d = 2.3$\,$pc) WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (WISE 0855), whose proximity and brightness make it ideal for a transiting exomoon search. We examine 11 hours of time-series spectra from the JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) whose sensitivity, in combination with Gaussian process (GP) modeling, allows for the disentanglement of exomoon transits from WISE 0855's variability. We do not find statistically significant evidence of an exomoon transit in this dataset. Using injection and recovery tests of artificial transits for depths ranging between 0.1-1% (0.35-1.12 $R_{\oplus}$) we explore the exomoon parameter space where we could successfully detect transits. For transit depths $\geq 0.5\%$ (1.96$\,R_{\text{Titan}}$), our detection rate is 96%, which, for WISE 0855, corresponds to a moon with a companion-to-host mass ratio similar to that of Titan and Saturn. Given our sensitivity, transit probabilities, and our observational duration, we determine a $\sim$91% probability of detecting a Titan mass analog exomoon after 18 such observations if every observed system hosts a Titan mass analog exomoon in a Galilean-like system. This suggests that JWST observations of dozens of FFPs could yield meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of exomoons. This paper is the first demonstration that JWST is sensitive to Galilean moon mass analogs around FFPs.</description>

      <title>ReplicationBench: Can AI Agents Replicate Astrophysics Research Papers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.</description>

      <title>AstroPix: A Pixelated HVCMOS Sensor for Space-Based Gamma-Ray Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A next-generation medium-energy gamma-ray telescope targeting the MeV range would address open questions in astrophysics regarding how extreme conditions accelerate cosmic-ray particles, produce relativistic jet outflows, and more. One concept, AMEGO-X, relies upon the mission-enabling CMOS Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor silicon chip AstroPix. AstroPix is designed for space-based use, featuring low noise, low power consumption, and high scalability. Desired performance of the device include an energy resolution of 5 keV (or 10% FWHM) at 122 keV and a dynamic range per-pixel of 25-700 keV, enabled by the addition of a high-voltage bias to each pixel which supports a depletion depth of 500 um. This work reports on the status of the AstroPix development process with emphasis on the current version under test, version three (v3), and highlights of version two (v2). Version 3 achieves energy resolution of 10.4 +/- 3.2% at 59.5 keV and 94 +/- 6 um depletion in a low-resistivity test silicon substrate.</description>

      <title>robostrategy: Field and Target Assignment Optimization in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithmic method for efficiently planning a long-term, large-scale multi-object spectroscopy program. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Focal Plane System performs multi-object spectroscopy using 500 robotic positioners to place fibers feeding optical and infrared spectrographs across a wide field. SDSS-V uses this system to observe targets throughout the year at two observatories in support of the science goals of its Milky Way Mapper and Black Hole Mapper programs. These science goals require observations of objects over time with preferred temporal spacinges (referred to as "cadences"), which can differ from object to object even in the same area of sky. robostrategy is the software we use to construct our planned observations so that they can best achieve the desired goals given the time available as a function of sky brightness and local sidereal time, and to assign fibers to targets during specific observations. We use linear programming techniques to seek optimal allocations of time under the constraints given. We present the methods and example results obtained with this software.</description>

      <title>BREAKFAST: A Framework for general joint BA duty and follow-up guidance of multiple $\gamma$-ray monitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM-HXMT-SVOM (GHS) constellation collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to Burst Advocates (BAs), including the increased number of triggers and, more importantly, the frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current requirements of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger astronomy, we developed a customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty, named "BA's Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and Summary Tools" (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated, semi-automated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST also aims to filtering high-value targets and guiding follow-up telescopes through rapid analysis and reporting, thus serving as an important bridge between prompt emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on prompt emission properties. The framework's effectiveness has already been demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the future.</description>
