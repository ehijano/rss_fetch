      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review comprehensively examines the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing the dynamic security assessments of modern power systems. It highlights the pivotal role of AI in facilitating scenario generation, incident prediction, risk assessment, and severity grading, thereby addressing the complexities introduced by renewable energy integration and advancements in digital grid technologies. The paper delves into data-driven techniques, with a particular focus on decision trees that effectively bridge operational characteristics with security metrics. These methodologies enable real-time, accurate predictions of system behaviors under varied operational conditions and support the optimization of control strategies. Through detailed analysis, we demonstrate how AI applications can transform traditional security assessment protocols, enhancing both the efficacy and efficiency of power system operations. The findings advocate for the potential of AI to significantly enhance the reliability and resilience of electrical grids, marking a paradigm shift towards more adaptive and intelligent power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>A review of the calculation methods of optimal power flow in integrated energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of Integrated Energy Systems (IES) is crucial for enhancing the comprehensive and complementary utilization of clean energy across China, significantly impacting the effective planning, operational coordination, and security control of the IES network. This paper presents a systematic review of the current research on optimal power flow (OPF) within IES, addressing the spatiotemporal interrelationships and coupled co-supply among primary energy processes such as electricity, gas, and heat (cooling). It highlights the challenges and future directions in this field, underscoring the lack of comprehensive studies on coupled power flow modeling for electricity-heat-gas systems and the need for more robust modeling approaches that align with practical engineering applications. Furthermore, the paper discusses the potential of multi-target energy storage systems to enhance energy consumption efficiency and flexibility in energy resource management. The existing models and algorithms for target power flow and optimal power flow are critiqued for their lack of flexibility and comprehensiveness, particularly in handling multi-objective flows and ensuring system safety and reliability. The study emphasizes the necessity for further development of safety and reliability assessment frameworks to support the evolving demands of integrated energy systems.</description>

      <title>Dual-Band, Slant-Polarized MIMO Antenna Set for Vehicular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slant-polarized Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) antennas are able to improve the performance of mobile communication systems in terms of channel capacity. Especially, the implementation of MIMO configurations for automotive applications requires to consider high gain, wideband, low-profile and affordable antennas in the communication link. In this work design, simulation and measurement of a new dual-band slant-polarized MIMO antenna with HPBW (Half Power Beam Width) of around 900 are presented. Then, four replicas of the proposed antenna set are placed at four different poles (North, South, West and East) to cover 3600 around the vehicle as an omni-directional pattern. In the real world scenario, the proper antenna set is selected to communicate with the intended user. Each slant MIMO antenna set consists of two inclined (450) low band (LB: 700 to 900 MHz) and two inclined high band (HB: 1.7 to 2.7 GHz) log-periodic antennas. The measured gain of LB and HB antennas are 7 dBi and 8 dBi, respectively. Great agreement between simulation and measurement results confirms the accuracy of the design and simulation procedures of antenna system using optimization algorithm (Genetic method). The proposed antenna is also measured in the field for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Highly Sensitive and Compact Quad-Band Ambient RF Energy Harvester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A highly efficient and compact quad band energy harvester (QBEH) circuit based on the extended composite right and left handed transmission lines (ECRLHTLs) technique is presented.The design procedure based on ECRLHTLs at four desired frequency bands is introduced to realize a quad band matching network (QBMN).The proposed QBEH operates at four frequency bands f1=0.75 GHz,f2=1.8 GHz,f3=2.4 GHz and f4=5.8 GHz. The simulations and experimental results of the proposed QBEH exhibit overall (end to end) efficiency of 55percent and 70percent while excited at four frequency bands simultaneously with negative 20dBm (10 microWatt) and negative 10dBm (100 microWatt) input power, respectively.Due to applying multi band excitation technique and radio frequency (RF) combining method in the QBEH circuit, the sensitivity is improved, and sufficient power is generated to realize a self sustainable sensor (S3) using ambient low level RF signals.A favorable impedance matching over a broad low input power range of negative 50 to negative 10 dBm (0.01 to 100 microWatt) is achieved, enabling the proposed QBEH to harvest ambient RF energy in urban environments. Moreover, an accurate theoretical analyses based on the Volterra series and Laplace transformation are presented to maximize the output DC current of the rectifier over a wide input power range.Theoretical, simulation and measurement results are in excellent agreement, which validate the design accuracy for the proposed quad band structure.The proposed new energy harvesting technique has the potential to practically realize a green energy harvesting solution to generate a viable energy source for low powered sensors and IoT devices, anytime, anywhere.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based adaptive speed controllers in mixed autonomy condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Automated Vehicles (AVs) into traffic flow holds the potential to significantly improve traffic congestion by enabling AVs to function as actuators within the flow. This paper introduces an adaptive speed controller tailored for scenarios of mixed autonomy, where AVs interact with human-driven vehicles. We model the traffic dynamics using a system of strongly coupled Partial and Ordinary Differential Equations (PDE-ODE), with the PDE capturing the general flow of human-driven traffic and the ODE characterizing the trajectory of the AVs. A speed policy for AVs is derived using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm structured within an Actor-Critic (AC) framework. This algorithm interacts with the PDE-ODE model to optimize the AV control policy. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the controller's impact on traffic patterns, showing the potential of AVs to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Chance-constrained SCED via Scenario Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies some compression methods to accelerate the scenario-based chance-constrained security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) problem. In particular, we show that by exclusively employing the vertices after convex hull compression, an equivalent solution can be obtained compared to utilizing the entire scenario set. For other compression methods that might relax the original solution, such as box compression, this paper presents the compression risk validation scheme to assess the risk arising from the sample space. By quantifying the risk associated with compression, decision-makers are empowered to select either solution risk or compression risk as the risk metric, depending on the complexity of specific problems. Numerical examples based on the 118-bus system and synthetic Texas grids compare these two risk metrics. The results also demonstrate the efficiency of compression methods in both problem formulation and solving processes.</description>

      <title>Safe Adaptive Control for Uncertain Systems with Complex Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive Control Barrier Function (CBF) based controller for nonlinear systems with complex, time-varying input constraints. Conventional CBF approaches often struggle with feasibility issues and stringent assumptions when addressing input constraints. Unlike these methods, our approach converts the input-constraint problem into an output-constraint CBF design. This transformation simplifies the Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation and enhances compatibility with the CBF framework. We design an adaptive CBF-based controller to manage the mismatched uncertainties introduced by this transformation. Our method systematically addresses the challenges of complex, time-varying, and state-dependent input constraints. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated using numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-time Convergent Distributed Multiobjective Optimization with Dynamic Event-triggered Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses distributed constrained multiobjective resource allocation problems (DCMRAPs) within multi-agent networks, where each agent has multiple, potentially conflicting local objectives, constrained by both local and global constraints. By reformulating the DCMRAP as a single-objective weighted $L_p$ problem, a distributed solution is enabled, which eliminates the need for predetermined weighting factors or centralized decision-making in traditional methods. Leveraging prescribed-time control and dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (ETMs), novel distributed algorithms are proposed to achieve Pareto optimality within a prescribed settling time through sampled communication. Using generalized time-based generators (TBGs), these algorithms provide more flexibility in optimizing accuracy and control smoothness without the constraints of initial conditions. Novel dynamic ETMs are designed to work with generalized TBGs to promote communication efficiency, which adjusts to both local error metrics and network-based disagreements. The Zeno behavior is excluded. Validated by Lyapunov analysis and simulations, our method demonstrates superior control performance and efficiency compared to existing methods, advancing distributed optimization in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Neural Horizon Model Predictive Control -- Increasing Computational Efficiency with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion in automation of increasingly fast applications and low-power edge devices poses a particular challenge for optimization based control algorithms, like model predictive control. Our proposed machine-learning supported approach addresses this by utilizing a feed-forward neural network to reduce the computation load of the online-optimization. We propose approximating part of the problem horizon, while maintaining safety guarantees -- constraint satisfaction -- via the remaining optimization part of the controller. The approach is validated in simulation, demonstrating an improvement in computational efficiency, while maintaining guarantees and near-optimal performance. The proposed MPC scheme can be applied to a wide range of applications, including those requiring a rapid control response, such as robotics and embedded applications with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Minimal Sensor Placement for Generic State and Unknown Input Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of selecting the minimum number of dedicated sensors to achieve observability in the presence of unknown inputs, namely, the state and input observability, for linear time-invariant systems. We assume that the only available information is the zero-nonzero structure of system matrices, and approach this problem within a structured system model. We revisit the concept of state and input observability for structured systems, providing refined necessary and sufficient conditions for placing dedicated sensors via the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition. Based on these conditions, we prove that determining the minimum number of dedicated sensors to achieve generic state and input observability is NP-hard, which contrasts sharply with the polynomial-time complexity of the corresponding problem with known inputs. We also demonstrate that this problem is hard to approximate within a factor of $(1-o(1)){\rm{log}}(n)$, where $n$ is the state dimension. Notwithstanding, we propose nontrivial upper and lower bounds that can be computed in polynomial time, which confine the optimal value of this problem to an interval with length being the number of inputs. We further present a special case for which the exact optimal value can be determined in polynomial time. Additionally, we propose a two-stage algorithm to solve this problem approximately. Each stage of the algorithm is either optimal or suboptimal and can be completed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive BESS and Grid Setpoints Optimization: A Model-Free Framework for Efficient Battery Management under Dynamic Tariff Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced framework for managing Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) in residential communities. The non-convex BESS control problem is first addressed using a gradient-based optimizer, providing a benchmark solution. Subsequently, the problem is tackled using multiple Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents, with a specific emphasis on the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. This version of SAC incorporates reward refinement based on this non-convex problem, applying logarithmic scaling to enhance convergence rates. Additionally, a safety mechanism selects only feasible actions from the action space, aimed at improving the learning curve, accelerating convergence, and reducing computation times. Moreover, the state representation of this DRL approach now includes uncertainties quantified in the entropy term, enhancing the model's adaptability across various entropy types. This developed system adheres to strict limits on the battery's State of Charge (SOC), thus preventing breaches of SOC boundaries and extending the battery lifespan. The robustness of the model is validated across several Australian states' districts, each characterized by unique uncertainty distributions. By implementing the refined SAC, the SOC consistently surpasses 50 percent by the end of each day, enabling the BESS control to start smoothly for the next day with some reserve. Finally, this proposed DRL method achieves a mean reduction in optimization time by 50 percent and an average cost saving of 40 percent compared to the gradient-based optimization benchmark.</description>

      <title>General Impedance Modeling for Modular Multilevel Converter with Grid-forming and Grid-following Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular multilevel converter (MMC) has complex topology, control architecture and broadband harmonic spectrum. For this, linear-time-periodic (LTP) theory, covering multi-harmonic coupling relations, has been adopted for MMC impedance modeling recently. However, the existing MMC impedance models usually lack explicit expressions and general modeling procedure for different control strategies. To this end, this paper proposes a general impedance modeling procedure applicable to various power converters with grid-forming and grid-following control strategies. The modeling is based on a unified representation of MMC circuit as the input and output relation between the voltage or current on the AC side and the exerted modulation index, while the control part vice versa, thereby interconnected as closed-loop feedback. With each part expressed as transfer functions, the final impedance model keeps the explicit form of harmonic transfer function matrix, making it convenient to directly observe and analyze the influence of each part individually. Thereby the submodule capacitance is found as the main cause of difference between MMC impedance compared to two-level converter, which will get closer as the capacitance increases. Effectiveness and generality of the impedance modeling method is demonstrated through comprehensive comparison with impedance scanning using electromagnetic transient simulation.</description>

      <title>LEAD: Towards Learning-Based Equity-Aware Decarbonization in Ridesharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ridesharing platforms such as Uber, Lyft, and DiDi have grown in popularity due to their on-demand availability, ease of use, and commute cost reductions, among other benefits. However, not all ridesharing promises have panned out. Recent studies demonstrate that the expected drop in traffic congestion and reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have not materialized. This is primarily due to the substantial distances traveled by the ridesharing vehicles without passengers between rides, known as deadhead miles. Recent work has focused on reducing the impact of deadhead miles while considering additional metrics such as rider waiting time, GHG emissions from deadhead miles, or driver earnings. Unfortunately, prior studies consider these environmental and equity-based metrics individually despite them being interrelated.
  In this paper, we propose a Learning-based Equity-Aware Decarabonization approach, LEAD, for ridesharing platforms. LEAD targets minimizing emissions while ensuring that the driver's utility, defined as the difference between the trip distance and the deadhead miles, is fairly distributed. LEAD uses reinforcement learning to match riders to drivers based on the expected future utility of drivers and the expected carbon emissions of the platform without increasing the rider waiting times. Extensive experiments based on a real-world ride-sharing dataset show that LEAD improves fairness by 2$\times$ when compared to emission-aware ride-assignment and reduces emissions by 70% while ensuring fairness within 66% of the fair baseline. It also reduces the rider wait time, by at least 40%, compared to various baselines. Additionally, LEAD corrects the imbalance in previous emission-aware ride assignment algorithms that overassigned rides to low-emission vehicles.</description>

      <title>GLANCE: Graph-based Learnable Digital Twin for Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As digital twins (DTs) to physical communication systems, network simulators can aid the design and deployment of communication networks. However, time-consuming simulations must be run for every new set of network configurations. Learnable digital twins (LDTs), in contrast, can be trained offline to emulate simulation outcomes and serve as a more efficient alternative to simulation-based DTs at runtime. In this work, we propose GLANCE, a communication LDT that learns from the simulator ns-3. It can evaluate network key performance indicators (KPIs) and assist in network management with exceptional efficiency. Leveraging graph learning, we exploit network data characteristics and devise a specialized architecture to embed sequential and topological features of traffic flows within the network. In addition, multi-task learning (MTL) and transfer learning (TL) are leveraged to enhance GLANCE's generalizability to unseen inputs and efficacy across different tasks. Beyond end-to-end KPI prediction, GLANCE can be deployed within an optimization framework for network management. It serves as an efficient or differentiable evaluator in optimizing network configurations such as traffic loads and flow destinations. Through numerical experiments and benchmarking, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed LDT architecture, demonstrate its robust generalization to various inputs, and showcase its efficacy in network management applications.</description>

      <title>Training Verifiably Robust Agents Using Set-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning often uses neural networks to solve complex control tasks. However, neural networks are sensitive to input perturbations, which makes their deployment in safety-critical environments challenging. This work lifts recent results from formally verifying neural networks against such disturbances to reinforcement learning in continuous state and action spaces using reachability analysis. While previous work mainly focuses on adversarial attacks for robust reinforcement learning, we train neural networks utilizing entire sets of perturbed inputs and maximize the worst-case reward. The obtained agents are verifiably more robust than agents obtained by related work, making them more applicable in safety-critical environments. This is demonstrated with an extensive empirical evaluation of four different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Planning of Off-Grid Renewable Power to Ammonia Systems with Heterogeneous Flexibility: A Multistakeholder Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Off-grid renewable power to ammonia (ReP2A) systems present a promising pathway toward carbon neutrality in both the energy and chemical industries. However, due to chemical safety requirements, the limited flexibility of ammonia synthesis poses a challenge when attempting to align with the variable hydrogen flow produced from renewable power. This necessitates the optimal sizing of equipment capacity for effective and coordinated production across the system. Additionally, an ReP2A system may involve multiple stakeholders with varying degrees of operational flexibility, complicating the planning problem. This paper first examines the multistakeholder sizing equilibrium (MSSE) of the ReP2A system. First, we propose an MSSE model that accounts for individual planning decisions and the competing economic interests of the stakeholders of power generation, hydrogen production, and ammonia synthesis. We then construct an equivalent optimization problem based on Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions to determine the equilibrium. Following this, we decompose the problem in the temporal dimension and solve it via multicut generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) to address long-term balancing issues. Case studies based on a realistic project reveal that the equilibrium does not naturally balance the interests of all stakeholders due to their heterogeneous characteristics. Our findings suggest that benefit transfer agreements ensure mutual benefits and the successful implementation of ReP2A projects.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strip Attitude Command of Earth Observation Satellite using Differential Dynamic Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimal scan profile problem for strip imaging in an Earth observation satellite (EOS) equipped with a time-delay integration (TDI) camera. Modern TDI cameras can control image integration frequency during imaging operation, adding an additional degree of freedom (DOF) to the imaging operation. On the other hand, modern agile EOS is capable of imaging non-parallel ground targets, which require a substantial amount of angular velocity and angular acceleration during operation. We leverage this DOF to minimize various factors impacting image quality, such as angular velocity. Initially, we derive analytic expressions for angular velocity based on kinematic equations. These expressions are then used to formulate a constrained optimal control problem (OCP), which we solve using differential dynamic programming (DDP). We validate our approach through testing and comparison with reference methods across various practical scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method efficiently achieves near-optimal solutions without encountering non-convergence issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a time-efficient attitude-tracking controller considering the slew rate constraint and control constraint. The algorithm defines the sliding surface, which is the linear combination of command, body, and regulating angular velocity, and utilizes the sliding surface to derive the control command that guarantees finite time stability. The regulating rate, which is an angular velocity regulating the attitude error between the command and body frame, is defined along the instantaneous eigen-axis between the two frames to minimize the rotation angle. In addition, the regulating rate is shaped such that the slew rate constraint is satisfied while the time to regulation is minimized with consideration of the control constraint. Practical scenarios involving Earth observation satellites are used to validate the algorithm's performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the analysis and design method of an optimal spare management policy using Markov chain for a large-scale satellite constellation. We propose an analysis methodology of spare strategy using a multi-echelon $(r,q)$ inventory control model with Markov chain, and review two different spare strategies: direct resupply, which inserts spares directly into the constellation orbit using launch vehicles; and indirect resupply, which places spares into parking orbits before transferring them to the constellation orbit. Furthermore, we propose an optimization formulation utilizing the results of the proposed analysis method, and an optimal solution is found using a genetic algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Compensated Model Predictive Control for Off-road Driving on Unknown Deformable Terrain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an Actor-Critic reinforcement learning Compensated Model Predictive Controller (AC2MPC) designed for high-speed, off-road autonomous driving on deformable terrains. Addressing the difficulty of modeling unknown tire-terrain interaction and ensuring real-time control feasibility and performance, this framework integrates deep reinforcement learning with a model predictive controller to manage unmodeled nonlinear dynamics. We evaluate the controller framework over constant and varying velocity profiles using high-fidelity simulator Project Chrono. Our findings demonstrate that our controller statistically outperforms standalone model-based and learning-based controllers over three unknown terrains that represent sandy deformable track, sandy and rocky track and cohesive clay-like deformable soil track. Despite varied and previously unseen terrain characteristics, this framework generalized well enough to track longitudinal reference speeds with the least error. Furthermore, this framework required significantly less training data compared to purely learning based controller, converging in fewer steps while delivering better performance. Even when under-trained, this controller outperformed the standalone controllers, highlighting its potential for safer and more efficient real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>ByCAN: Reverse Engineering Controller Area Network (CAN) Messages from Bit to Byte Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the primary standard protocol for modern cars, the Controller Area Network (CAN) is a critical research target for automotive cybersecurity threats and autonomous applications. As the decoding specification of CAN is a proprietary black-box maintained by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs), conducting related research and industry developments can be challenging without a comprehensive understanding of the meaning of CAN messages. In this paper, we propose a fully automated reverse-engineering system, named ByCAN, to reverse engineer CAN messages. ByCAN outperforms existing research by introducing byte-level clusters and integrating multiple features at both byte and bit levels. ByCAN employs the clustering and template matching algorithms to automatically decode the specifications of CAN frames without the need for prior knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that ByCAN achieves high accuracy in slicing and labeling performance, i.e., the identification of CAN signal boundaries and labels. In the experiments, ByCAN achieves slicing accuracy of 80.21%, slicing coverage of 95.21%, and labeling accuracy of 68.72% for general labels when analyzing the real-world CAN frames.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Learning of Dish Rinsing and Scrubbing based on Interruptive Direct Teaching Considering Assistance Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots are expected to manipulate objects in a safe and dexterous way. For example, washing dishes is a dexterous operation that involves scrubbing the dishes with a sponge and rinsing them with water. It is necessary to learn it safely without splashing water and without dropping the dishes. In this study, we propose a safe and dexterous manipulation system. %that can scrub and rinse dirty dishes. The robot learns a dynamics model of the object by estimating the state of the object and the robot itself, the control input, and the amount of human assistance required (assistance rate) after the human corrects the initial trajectory of the robot's hands by interruptive direct teaching. By backpropagating the error between the estimated and the reference value %at the next time using the acquired dynamics model, the robot can generate a control input that approaches the reference value, for example, so that human assistance is not required and the dish does not move excessively. This allows for adaptive rinsing and scrubbing of dishes with unknown shapes and properties. As a result, it is possible to generate safe actions that require less human assistance.</description>

      <title>ISAC-Fi: Enabling Full-fledged Monostatic Sensing over Wi-Fi Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whereas Wi-Fi communications have been exploited for sensing purpose for over a decade, the bistatic or multistatic nature of Wi-Fi still poses multiple challenges, hampering real-life deployment of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) within Wi-Fi framework. In this paper, we aim to re-design WiFi so that monostatic sensing (mimicking radar) can be achieved over the multistatic communication infrastructure. Specifically, we propose, design, and implement ISAC-Fi as an ISAC-ready Wi-Fi prototype. We first present a novel self-interference cancellation scheme, in order to extract reflected (radio frequency) signals for sensing purpose in the face of transmissions. We then subtly revise existing Wi-Fi framework so as to seamlessly operate monostatic sensing under Wi-Fi communication standard. Finally, we offer two ISAC-Fi designs: while a USRP-based one emulates a totally re-designed ISAC-Fi device, another plug-andplay design allows for backward compatibility by attaching an extra module to an arbitrary Wi-Fi device. We perform extensive experiments to validate the efficacy of ISAC-Fi and also to demonstrate its superiority over existing Wi-Fi sensing proposals.</description>

      <title>Perfectly Undetectable Reflection and Scaling False Data Injection Attacks via Affine Transformation on Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS) into critical applications, ensuring their resilience against cyberattacks is paramount. A particularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks that degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper investigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The proposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals, exploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and symmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these attacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform, highlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and resilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats. Furthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state monitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a carefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect the presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.</description>

      <title>A Generalizable Physics-informed Learning Framework for Risk Probability Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of long-term risk probabilities and their gradients are critical for many stochastic safe control methods. However, computing such risk probabilities in real-time and in unseen or changing environments is challenging. Monte Carlo (MC) methods cannot accurately evaluate the probabilities and their gradients as an infinitesimal devisor can amplify the sampling noise. In this paper, we develop an efficient method to evaluate the probabilities of long-term risk and their gradients. The proposed method exploits the fact that long-term risk probability satisfies certain partial differential equations (PDEs), which characterize the neighboring relations between the probabilities, to integrate MC methods and physics-informed neural networks. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimation error given certain choices of training configurations. Numerical results show the proposed method has better sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and can adapt to systems with changing parameters. The proposed method can also accurately estimate the gradients of risk probabilities, which enables first- and second-order techniques on risk probabilities to be used for learning and control.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a general and practical approach to estimate the economic benefits of optimally controlling deferrable loads in a Distribution System Operator's (DSO) grid, without relying on historical observations. We achieve this by learning the simulated response of flexible loads to random control signals, using a non-parametric global forecasting model. An optimal control policy is found by including the latter in an optimization problem. We apply this method to electric water heaters and heat pumps operated through ripple control and show how flexibility, including rebound effects, can be characterized and controlled. Finally, we show that the forecaster's accuracy is sufficient to completely bypass the simulations and directly use the forecaster to estimate the economic benefit of flexibility control.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of group target tracking (GTT), wherein multiple closely spaced targets within a group pose a coordinated motion. To improve the tracking performance, the labeled random finite sets (LRFSs) theory is adopted, and this paper develops a new kind of LRFSs, i.e., augmented LRFSs, which introduces group information into the definition of LRFSs. Specifically, for each element in an LRFS, the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of its represented target are incorporated. Furthermore, by means of the labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs, the group structure is iteratively propagated and updated during the tracking process, which achieves the simultaneously estimation of the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of multiple group targets, and further improves the GTT tracking performance. Finally, simulation experiments are provided, which well demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeled multi-Bernoulli filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs for GTT tracking.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated control strategy for optimal fast charging and active thermal management of Lithium-ion batteries in extreme ambient temperatures, striking a balance between charging speed and battery health. A control-oriented thermal-NDC (nonlinear double-capacitor) battery model is proposed to describe the electrical and thermal dynamics, incorporating the effects of both an active thermal source and ambient temperature. A state-feedback model predictive control algorithm is then developed for optimal fast charging and active thermal management. Numerical experiments validate the algorithm under extreme temperatures, showing that the proposed algorithm can energy-efficiently adjust the battery temperature, thereby balancing charging speed and battery health. Additionally, an output-feedback model predictive control algorithm with an extended Kalman filter is proposed for battery charging when states are partially measurable. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness under extreme temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a correct-by-design controller for an autonomous vehicle interacting with opponent vehicles with unknown intentions. We define an intention-aware control problem incorporating epistemic uncertainties of the opponent vehicles and model their intentions as discrete-valued random variables. Then, we focus on a control objective specified as belief-space temporal logic specifications. From this stochastic control problem, we derive a sound deterministic control problem using stochastic expansion and solve it using shrinking-horizon model predictive control. The solved intention-aware controller allows a vehicle to adjust its behaviors according to its opponents' intentions. It ensures provable safety by restricting the probabilistic risk under a desired level. We show with experimental studies that the proposed method ensures strict limitation of risk probabilities, validating its efficacy in autonomous driving cases. This work provides a novel solution for the risk-aware control of interactive vehicles with formal safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Remaining Discharge Energy Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries Over Broad Current Ranges: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have found their way into myriad sectors of industry to drive electrification, decarbonization, and sustainability. A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy levels. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics especially at high C-rates. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The experimental validation shows that the proposed approach can predict the remaining discharge energy with a relative error of less than 3% when the current varies between 0~8 C for an NCA cell and 0~15 C for an LFP cell. The approach, by design, is amenable to training and computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a joint sensing and communication system is presented for smart agriculture. The system integrates an Ultra-compact Soil Moisture Sensor (UCSMS) for precise sensing, along with a Pattern Reconfigurable Antenna (PRA) for efficient transmission of information to the base station. A multiturn complementary spiral resonator (MCSR) is etched onto the ground plane of a microstrip transmission line to achieve miniaturization. The UCSMS operates at 180 MHz with a 3-turn complementary spiral resonator (3-CSR), at 102 MHz with a 4- turn complementary spiral resonator (4-CSR), and at 86 MHz with a 5-turn complementary spiral resonator (5-CSR). Due to its low resonance frequency, the proposed UCSMS is insensitive to variations in the Volume Under Test (VUT) of soil. A probe-fed circular patch antenna is designed in the Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) band (2.45 GHz) with a maximum measured gain of 5.63 dBi. Additionally, four varactor diodes are integrated across the slots on the bottom side of the substrate to achieve pattern reconfiguration. Six different radiation patterns have been achieved by using different bias conditions of the diodes. In standby mode, PRA can serve as a means for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) or Energy Harvesting (EH) to store power in a battery. This stored power can then be utilized to bias the varactor diodes. The combination of UCSMS and PRA enables the realization of a joint sensing and communication system. The proposed system's planar and simple geometry, along with its high sensitivity of 2.05 %, makes it suitable for smart agriculture applications. Moreover, the sensor is adaptive and capable of measuring the permittivity of various Material Under Test (MUT) within the range of 1 to 23.</description>

      <title>Multidirectional Pixelated Cubic Antenna with Enhanced Isolation for Vehicular Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14760v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a pixelated cubic antenna design with enhanced isolation and diverse radiation pattern for vehicular applications. The design consists of four radiating patches to take advantage of a nearly omnidirectional radiation pattern with enhanced isolation and high gain. The antenna system with four patches has been pixelated and optimized simultaneously to achieve desired performance and high isolation at 5.4 GHz band. The antenna achieved measured isolation of more than -34 dB between antenna elements. The overall isolation improvement obtained by the antenna is about 18 dB compared to a configuration using standard patch antennas. Moreover, isolation improvement is achieved through patch pixelization without additional resonators or elements. The antenna achieved up to 6.9 dB realized gain in each direction. Additionally, the cubic antenna system is equipped with an E-shaped GPS antenna to facilitate connectivity with GPS satellite. Finally, the antenna performance has been investigated using a simulation model of the vehicle roof and roof rack. The reflection coefficient, isolation and radiation patterns of the antenna remains unaffected. The antenna prototype has been fabricated on Rogers substrate and measured to verify the simulation results. The measured results correlate well with the simulation results. The proposed antenna features low-profile, simple design for ease of manufacture, good radiation characteristics with multidirectional property and high isolation, which are well-suited to vehicular applications in different environments.</description>

      <title>Wireless MAC Protocol Synthesis and Optimization with Multi-Agent Distributed Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) framework for Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design. Unlike centralized approaches, which rely on a single entity for decision-making, MADRL empowers individual network nodes to autonomously learn and optimize their MAC based on local observations. Leveraging ns3-ai and RLlib, as far as we are aware of, our framework is the first of a kind that enables distributed multi-agent learning within the ns-3 environment, facilitating the design and synthesis of adaptive MAC protocols tailored to specific environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MADRL MAC framework through extensive simulations, showcasing superior performance compared to legacy protocols across diverse scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of MADRL-based MAC protocols to significantly enhance Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for future wireless applications.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Deep Learning for Reachability Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite any disturbance within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reach-avoid value function and post-learning certification. Compared to prior works, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway takeover example.</description>

      <title>On Safety and Liveness Filtering Using Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based filtering provides a powerful framework to co-optimize performance and safety (or liveness) for autonomous systems. Under this filtering scheme, a nominal controller is minimally modified to ensure system safety or liveness. However, the resulting controllers can exhibit abrupt switching and bang-bang behavior, which is not suitable for applications of autonomous systems in the real world. This work presents a novel, unifying framework to design safety and liveness filters through reachability analysis. We explicitly characterize the maximal set of control inputs that ensures safety (or liveness) at a given state. Different safety filters can then be constructed using different subsets of this maximal set along with a projection operator to modify the nominal controller. We use the proposed framework to design three safety filters, each balancing performance, computation time, and smoothness differently. We highlight their relative strengths and limitations by applying these filters to autonomous navigation and rocket landing scenarios and on a physical robot testbed. We also discuss practical aspects associated with implementing these filters on real-world autonomous systems. Our research advances the understanding and potential application of reachability-based controllers on real-world autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Control of Discrete-Time Stochastic Systems: Integrating Kalman Filter and Worst-case CVaR in Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes control approaches for discrete-time linear systems subject to stochastic disturbances. It employs Kalman filter to estimate the mean and covariance of the state propagation, and the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) to quantify the tail risk using the estimated mean and covariance. The quantified risk is then integrated into a control barrier function (CBF) to derive constraints for controller synthesis, addressing tail risks near safe set boundaries. Two optimization-based control methods are presented using the obtained constraints for half-space and ellipsoidal safe sets, respectively. The effectiveness of the obtained results is demonstrated using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards Near-Field 3D Spot Beamfocusing: Possibilities, Challenges, and Use-cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spot beamfocusing (SBF) is the process of focusing the signal power in a small spot-like region in the 3D space, which can be either hard-tuned (HT) using traditional tools like lenses and mirrors or electronically reconfigured (ER) using modern large-scale intelligent surface phased arrays. ER-SBF can be a key enabling technology (KET) for the next-generation 6G wireless networks offering benefits to many future wireless application areas such as wireless communication and security, mid-range high-power and safe wireless chargers, medical and health, physics, etc. Although near-field HT-SBF and ER-beamfocusing have been studied in the literature and applied in the industry, there is no comprehensive study of different aspects of ER-SBF and its future applications, especially for nonoptical (mmWave, sub-THz, and THz) electromagnetic waves in the next generation wireless technology, which is the aim of this paper. The theoretical concepts behind ER-SBF, different antenna technologies for implementing ER-SBF, employing machine learning (ML)-based schemes for enabling channel-state-information (CSI)-independent ER-SBF, and different practical application areas that can benefit from ER-SBF will be explored.</description>

      <title>PowerGraph: A power grid benchmark dataset for graph neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and, therefore, engineered to operate under diverse conditions and failures. The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, developing grid analysis algorithms is important for supporting reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling. The dataset is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PowerGraph/22820534 and the code at https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets.</description>

      <title>Conjectural Online Learning with First-order Beliefs in Asymmetric Information Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18781v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymmetric information stochastic games (AISGs) arise in many complex socio-technical systems, such as cyber-physical systems and IT infrastructures. Existing computational methods for AISGs are primarily offline and can not adapt to equilibrium deviations. Further, current methods are limited to particular information structures to avoid belief hierarchies. Considering these limitations, we propose conjectural online learning (COL), an online learning method under generic information structures in AISGs. COL uses a forecaster-actor-critic (FAC) architecture, where subjective forecasts are used to conjecture the opponents' strategies within a lookahead horizon, and Bayesian learning is used to calibrate the conjectures. To adapt strategies to nonstationary environments based on information feedback, COL uses online rollout with cost function approximation (actor-critic). We prove that the conjectures produced by COL are asymptotically consistent with the information feedback in the sense of a relaxed Bayesian consistency. We also prove that the empirical strategy profile induced by COL converges to the Berk-Nash equilibrium, a solution concept characterizing rationality under subjectivity. Experimental results from an intrusion response use case demonstrate COL's {faster convergence} over state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods against nonstationary attacks.</description>

      <title>ForzaETH Race Stack -- Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing in robotics combines high-speed dynamics with the necessity for reliability and real-time decision-making. While such racing pushes software and hardware to their limits, many existing full-system solutions necessitate complex, custom hardware and software, and usually focus on Time-Trials rather than full unrestricted Head-to-Head racing, due to financial and safety constraints. This limits their reproducibility, making advancements and replication feasible mostly for well-resourced laboratories with comprehensive expertise in mechanical, electrical, and robotics fields. Researchers interested in the autonomy domain but with only partial experience in one of these fields, need to spend significant time with familiarization and integration. The ForzaETH Race Stack addresses this gap by providing an autonomous racing software platform designed for F1TENTH, a 1:10 scaled Head-to-Head autonomous racing competition, which simplifies replication by using commercial off-the-shelf hardware. This approach enhances the competitive aspect of autonomous racing and provides an accessible platform for research and development in the field. The ForzaETH Race Stack is designed with modularity and operational ease of use in mind, allowing customization and adaptability to various environmental conditions, such as track friction and layout. Capable of handling both Time-Trials and Head-to-Head racing, the stack has demonstrated its effectiveness, robustness, and adaptability in the field by winning the official F1TENTH international competition multiple times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work in reinforcement learning has leveraged symmetries in the model to improve sample efficiency in training a policy. A commonly used simplifying assumption is that the dynamics and reward both exhibit the same symmetry; however, in many real-world environments, the dynamical model exhibits symmetry independent of the reward model. In this paper, we assume only the dynamics exhibit symmetry, extending the scope of problems in reinforcement learning and learning in control theory to which symmetry techniques can be applied. We use Cartan's moving frame method to introduce a technique for learning dynamics that, by construction, exhibit specified symmetries. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns a more accurate dynamical model</description>

      <title>PhiBE: A PDE-based Bellman Equation for Continuous Time Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of continuous-time reinforcement learning in scenarios where the dynamics follow a stochastic differential equation. When the underlying dynamics remain unknown and we have access only to discrete-time information, how can we effectively conduct policy evaluation? We first highlight that the commonly used Bellman equation (BE) is not always a reliable approximation to the true value function. We then introduce a new bellman equation, PhiBE, which integrates the discrete-time information into a PDE formulation. The new bellman equation offers a more accurate approximation to the true value function, especially in scenarios where the underlying dynamics change slowly. Moreover, we extend PhiBE to higher orders, providing increasingly accurate approximations. We conduct the error analysis for both BE and PhiBE with explicit dependence on the discounted coefficient, the reward and the dynamics. Additionally, we present a model-free algorithm to solve PhiBE when only discrete-time trajectory data is available. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical guarantees we propose.</description>

      <title>Sim-to-Real Transfer of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents for Online Coverage Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer presents a difficult challenge, where models trained in simulation are to be deployed in the real world. The distribution shift between the two settings leads to biased representations of the dynamics, and thus to suboptimal predictions in the real-world environment. In this work, we tackle the challenge of sim-to-real transfer of reinforcement learning (RL) agents for coverage path planning (CPP). In CPP, the task is for a robot to find a path that covers every point of a confined area. Specifically, we consider the case where the environment is unknown, and the agent needs to plan the path online while mapping the environment. We bridge the sim-to-real gap through a semi-virtual environment, including a real robot and real-time aspects, while utilizing a simulated sensor and obstacles to enable environment randomization and automated episode resetting. We investigate what level of fine-tuning is needed for adapting to a realistic setting, comparing to an agent trained solely in simulation. We find that a high inference frequency allows first-order Markovian policies to transfer directly from simulation, while higher-order policies can be fine-tuned to further reduce the sim-to-real gap. Moreover, they can operate at a lower frequency, thus reducing computational requirements. In both cases, our approaches transfer state-of-the-art results from simulation to the real domain, where direct learning would take in the order of weeks with manual interaction, that is, it would be completely infeasible.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Physics-Informed Learning for Stochastic Safety-Critical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimate of long-term risk is critical for safe decision-making, but sampling from rare risk events and long-term trajectories can be prohibitively costly. Risk gradient can be used in many first-order techniques for learning and control methods, but gradient estimate is difficult to obtain using Monte Carlo (MC) methods because the infinitesimal divisor may significantly amplify sampling noise. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method to evaluate long-term risk probabilities and their gradients using short-term samples without sufficient risk events. We first derive that four types of long-term risk probability are solutions of certain partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, we propose a physics-informed learning technique that integrates data and physics information (aforementioned PDEs). The physics information helps propagate information beyond available data and obtain provable generalization beyond available data, which in turn enables long-term risk to be estimated using short-term samples of safe events. Finally, we demonstrate in simulation that the proposed technique has improved sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and adapts to changing system parameters.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning for Intra-Day Power Grid Operation through Topology Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the increase in generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. In this paper we study the performance of imitation learning for day-ahead power grid operation through topology actions. In particular, we consider two rule-based expert agents: a greedy agent and a N-1 agent. While the latter is more computationally expensive since it takes N-1 safety considerations into account, it exhibits a much higher operational performance. We train a fully-connected neural network (FCNN) on expert state-action pairs and evaluate it in two ways. First, we find that classification accuracy is limited despite extensive hyperparameter tuning, due to class imbalance and class overlap. Second, as a power system agent, the FCNN performs only slightly worse than expert agents. Furthermore, hybrid agents, which incorporate minimal additional simulations, match expert agents' performance with significantly lower computational cost. Consequently, imitation learning shows promise for developing fast, high-performing power grid agents, motivating its further exploration in future L2RPN studies.</description>

Abstract: This paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in a novel and practical next-generation cellular network where two modes of semantic communication (SemCom) and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist, namely hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we comprehensively develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with several practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by employing a Lagrange primal-dual method and devising a preference list-based heuristic algorithm. Finally, numerical results validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.</description>
