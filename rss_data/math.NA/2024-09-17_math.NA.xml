      <title>Strengthening Interpretability: An Investigative Study of Integrated Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a reproducibility study on Integrated Gradients (IG) based methods and the Important Direction Gradient Integration (IDGI) framework. IDGI eliminates the explanation noise in each step of the computation of IG-based methods that use the Riemann Integration for integrated gradient computation. We perform a rigorous theoretical analysis of IDGI and raise a few critical questions that we later address through our study. We also experimentally verify the authors' claims concerning the performance of IDGI over IG-based methods. Additionally, we varied the number of steps used in the Riemann approximation, an essential parameter in all IG methods, and analyzed the corresponding change in results. We also studied the numerical instability of the attribution methods to check the consistency of the saliency maps produced. We developed the complete code to implement IDGI over the baseline IG methods and evaluated them using three metrics since the available code was insufficient for this study.</description>

      <title>Measurability and continuity of parametric low-rank approximation in Hilbert spaces: linear operators and random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified theoretical framework for low-rank approximation techniques in parametric settings, where traditional methods like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) face significant challenges due to repeated queries. Applications include, e.g., the numerical treatment of parameter-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs), where operators vary with parameters, and the statistical analysis of longitudinal data, where complex measurements like audio signals and images are collected over time. Although the applied literature has introduced partial solutions through adaptive algorithms, these advancements lack a comprehensive mathematical foundation. As a result, key theoretical questions -- such as the existence and parametric regularity of optimal low-rank approximants -- remain inadequately addressed. Our goal is to bridge this gap between theory and practice by establishing a rigorous framework for parametric low-rank approximation under minimal assumptions, specifically focusing on cases where parameterizations are either measurable or continuous. The analysis is carried out within the context of separable Hilbert spaces, ensuring applicability to both finite and infinite-dimensional settings. Finally, connections to recently emerging trends in the Deep Learning literature, relevant for engineering and data science, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LSMR algorithms for large-scale general-form regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hybrid LSMR algorithm is proposed for large-scale general-form regularization. It is based on a Krylov subspace projection method where the matrix $A$ is first projected onto a subspace, typically a Krylov subspace, which is implemented via the Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization process applied to $A$, with starting vector $b$. Then a regularization term is employed to the projections. Finally, an iterative algorithm is exploited to solve a least squares problem with constraints. The resulting algorithms are called the {hybrid LSMR algorithm}. At every step, we exploit LSQR algorithm to solve the inner least squares problem, which is proven to become better conditioned as the number of $k$ increases, so that the LSQR algorithm converges faster. We prove how to select the stopping tolerances for LSQR in order to guarantee that the regularized solution obtained by iteratively computing the inner least squares problems and the one obtained by exactly computing the inner least squares problems have the same accuracy. Numerical experiments illustrate that the best regularized solution by the hybrid LSMR algorithm is as accurate as that by JBDQR which is a joint bidiagonalization based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust optimal design of large-scale Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider robust optimal experimental design (ROED) for nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). An optimal design is one that maximizes some utility quantifying the quality of the solution of an inverse problem. However, the optimal design is dependent on elements of the inverse problem such as the simulation model, the prior, or the measurement error model. ROED aims to produce an optimal design that is aware of the additional uncertainties encoded in the inverse problem and remains optimal even after variations in them. We follow a worst-case scenario approach to develop a new framework for robust optimal design of nonlinear Bayesian inverse problems. The proposed framework a) is scalable and designed for infinite-dimensional Bayesian nonlinear inverse problems constrained by PDEs; b) develops efficient approximations of the utility, namely, the expected information gain; c) employs eigenvalue sensitivity techniques to develop analytical forms and efficient evaluation methods of the gradient of the utility with respect to the uncertainties we wish to be robust against; and d) employs a probabilistic optimization paradigm that properly defines and efficiently solves the resulting combinatorial max-min optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated for optimal sensor placement problem in an inverse problem governed by an elliptic PDE.</description>

      <title>Matrix perturbation analysis of methods for extracting singular values from approximate singular subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given (orthonormal) approximations $\tilde{U}$ and $\tilde{V}$ to the left and right subspaces spanned by the leading singular vectors of a matrix $A$, we discuss methods to approximate the leading singular values of $A$ and study their accuracy. In particular, we focus our analysis on the generalized Nystr\"om approximation, as surprisingly, it is able to obtain significantly better accuracy than classical methods, namely Rayleigh-Ritz and (one-sided) projected SVD.
  A key idea of the analysis is to view the methods as finding the exact singular values of a perturbation of $A$. In this context, we derive a matrix perturbation result that exploits the structure of such $2\times2$ block matrix perturbation. Furthermore, we extend it to block tridiagonal matrices. We then obtain bounds on the accuracy of the extracted singular values. This leads to sharp bounds that predict well the approximation error trends and explain the difference in the behavior of these methods. Finally, we present an approach to derive an a-posteriori version of those bounds, which are more amenable to computation in practice.</description>

      <title>Rational-WENO: A lightweight, physically-consistent three-point weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional WENO3 methods are known to be highly dissipative at lower resolutions, introducing significant errors in the pre-asymptotic regime. In this paper, we employ a rational neural network to accurately estimate the local smoothness of the solution, dynamically adapting the stencil weights based on local solution features. As rational neural networks can represent fast transitions between smooth and sharp regimes, this approach achieves a granular reconstruction with significantly reduced dissipation, improving the accuracy of the simulation. The network is trained offline on a carefully chosen dataset of analytical functions, bypassing the need for differentiable solvers. We also propose a robust model selection criterion based on estimates of the interpolation's convergence order on a set of test functions, which correlates better with the model performance in downstream tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several one-, two-, and three-dimensional fluid flow problems: our scheme generalizes across grid resolutions while handling smooth and discontinuous solutions. In most cases, our rational network-based scheme achieves higher accuracy than conventional WENO3 with the same stencil size, and in a few of them, it achieves accuracy comparable to WENO5, which uses a larger stencil.</description>

      <title>Error estimates of finite element methods for nonlocal problems using exact or approximated interaction neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic error between the finite element solutions of nonlocal models with a bounded interaction neighborhood and the exact solution of the limiting local model. The limit corresponds to the case when the horizon parameter, the radius of the spherical nonlocal interaction neighborhood of the nonlocal model, and the mesh size simultaneously approach zero. Two important cases are discussed: one involving the original nonlocal models and the other for nonlocal models with polygonal approximations of the nonlocal interaction neighborhood. Results of numerical experiments are also reported to substantiate the theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Factorization method for inverse elastic cavity scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the inverse elastic scattering problem to determine the shape and location of an elastic cavity. By establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the Herglotz wave function and its kernel, we introduce the far-field operator which is crucial in the factorization method. We present a theoretical factorization of the far-field operator and rigorously prove the properties of its associated operators involved in the factorization. Unlike the Dirichlet problem where the boundary integral operator of the single-layer potential involved in the factorization of the far-field operator is weakly singular, the boundary integral operator of the conormal derivative of the double-layer potential involved in the factorization of the far-field operator with Neumann boundary conditions is hypersingular, which forces us to prove that this operator is isomorphic using Fredholm's theorem. Meanwhile, we present theoretical analyses of the factorization method for various illumination and measurement cases, including compression-wave illumination and compression-wave measurement, shear-wave illumination and shear-wave measurement, and full-wave illumination and full-wave measurement. In addition, we also consider the limited aperture problem and provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the factorization method in this case. Numerous numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and to analyze the influence of various factors, such as polarization direction, frequency, wavenumber, and multi-scale scatterers on the reconstructed results.</description>

      <title>Two-grid convergence theory for symmetric positive semidefinite linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the convergence theory of two-grid methods for symmetric positive semidefinite linear systems, with particular focus on the singular case. In the case where the Moore--Penrose inverse of coarse-grid matrix is used as a coarse solver, we derive a succinct identity for characterizing the convergence factor of two-grid methods. More generally, we present some convergence estimates for two-grid methods with approximate coarse solvers, including both linear and general cases. A key feature of our analysis is that it does not require any additional assumptions on the system matrix, especially on its null space.</description>

      <title>Randomized sketched TT-GMRES for linear systems with tensor structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, tensors have shown their potential as valuable tools for various tasks in numerical linear algebra. While most of the research has been focusing on how to compress a given tensor in order to maintain information as well as reducing the storage demand for its allocation, the solution of linear tensor equations is a less explored venue. Even if many of the routines available in the literature are based on alternating minimization schemes (ALS), we pursue a different path and utilize Krylov methods instead. The use of Krylov methods in the tensor realm is not new. However, these routines often turn out to be rather expensive in terms of computational cost and ALS procedures are preferred in practice. We enhance Krylov methods for linear tensor equations with a panel of diverse randomization-based strategies which remarkably increase the efficiency of these solvers making them competitive with state-of-the-art ALS schemes. The up-to-date randomized approaches we employ range from sketched Krylov methods with incomplete orthogonalization and structured sketching transformations to streaming algorithms for tensor rounding. The promising performance of our new solver for linear tensor equations is demonstrated by many numerical results.</description>

      <title>High-order accurate structure-preserving finite volume schemes on adaptive moving meshes for shallow water equations: Well-balancedness and positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops high-order accurate, well-balanced (WB), and positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume schemes for shallow water equations on adaptive moving structured meshes. The mesh movement poses new challenges in maintaining the WB property, which not only depends on the balance between flux gradients and source terms but is also affected by the mesh movement. To address these complexities, the WB property in curvilinear coordinates is decomposed into flux source balance and mesh movement balance. The flux source balance is achieved by suitable decomposition of the source terms, the numerical fluxes based on hydrostatic reconstruction, and appropriate discretization of the geometric conservation laws (GCLs). Concurrently, the mesh movement balance is maintained by integrating additional schemes to update the bottom topography during mesh adjustments. The proposed schemes are rigorously proven to maintain the WB property by using the discrete GCLs and these two balances. We provide rigorous analyses of the PP property under a sufficient condition enforced by a PP limiter. Due to the involvement of mesh metrics and movement, the analyses are nontrivial, while some standard techniques, such as splitting high-order schemes into convex combinations of formally first-order PP schemes, are not directly applicable. Various numerical examples validate the high-order accuracy, high efficiency, WB, and PP properties of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Robust DG Schemes on Unstructured Triangular Meshes: Oscillation Elimination and Bound Preservation via Optimal Convex Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes on unstructured meshes offer the advantages of compactness and the ability to handle complex computational domains. However, their robustness and reliability in solving hyperbolic conservation laws depend on two critical abilities: suppressing spurious oscillations and preserving intrinsic bounds or constraints. This paper introduces two significant advancements in enhancing the robustness and efficiency of DG methods on unstructured meshes for general hyperbolic conservation laws, while maintaining their accuracy and compactness. First, we investigate the oscillation-eliminating (OE) DG methods on unstructured meshes. These methods not only maintain key features such as conservation, scale invariance, and evolution invariance but also achieve rotation invariance through a novel rotation-invariant OE (RIOE) procedure. Second, we propose, for the first time, the optimal convex decomposition for designing efficient bound-preserving (BP) DG schemes on unstructured meshes. Finding the optimal convex decomposition that maximizes the BP CFL number is an important yet challenging problem.While this challenge was addressed for rectangular meshes, it remains an open problem for triangular meshes. This paper successfully constructs the optimal convex decomposition for the widely used $P^1$ and $P^2$ spaces on triangular cells, significantly improving the efficiency of BP DG methods.The maximum BP CFL numbers are increased by 100%--200% for $P^1$ and 280.38%--350% for $P^2$, compared to classic decomposition. Furthermore, our RIOE procedure and optimal decomposition technique can be integrated into existing DG codes with little and localized modifications. These techniques require only edge-neighboring cell information, thereby retaining the compactness and high parallel efficiency of original DG methods.</description>

      <title>High-Order Oscillation-Eliminating Hermite WENO Method for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes high-order accurate, oscillation-eliminating Hermite weighted essentially non-oscillatory (OE-HWENO) finite volume schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws. The OE-HWENO schemes apply an OE procedure after each Runge--Kutta stage, dampening the first-order moments of the HWENO solution to suppress spurious oscillations without any problem-dependent parameters. This OE procedure acts as a filter, derived from the solution operator of a novel damping equation, solved exactly without discretization. As a result, the OE-HWENO method remains stable with a normal CFL number, even for strong shocks producing highly stiff damping terms. To ensure the method's non-oscillatory property across varying scales and wave speeds, we design a scale- and evolution-invariant damping equation and propose a dimensionless transformation for HWENO reconstruction. The OE-HWENO method offers several advantages over existing HWENO methods: the OE procedure is efficient and easy to implement, requiring only simple multiplication of first-order moments; it preserves high-order accuracy, local compactness, and spectral properties. The non-intrusive OE procedure can be integrated seamlessly into existing HWENO codes. Finally, we analyze the bound-preserving (BP) property using optimal cell average decomposition, relaxing the BP time step-size constraint and reducing decomposition points, improving efficiency. Extensive benchmarks validate the method's accuracy, efficiency, resolution, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Local MALA-within-Gibbs for Bayesian image deblurring with total variation prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Bayesian inference for image deblurring with total variation (TV) prior. Since the posterior is analytically intractable, we resort to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, since most MCMC methods significantly deteriorate in high dimensions, they are not suitable to handle high resolution imaging problems. In this paper, we show how low-dimensional sampling can still be facilitated by exploiting the sparse conditional structure of the posterior. To this end, we make use of the local structures of the blurring operator and the TV prior by partitioning the image into rectangular blocks and employing a blocked Gibbs sampler with proposals stemming from the Metropolis-Hastings adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA). We prove that this MALA-within-Gibbs (MLwG) sampling algorithm has dimension-independent block acceptance rates and dimension-independent convergence rate. In order to apply the MALA proposals, we approximate the TV by a smoothed version, and show that the introduced approximation error is evenly distributed and dimension-independent. Since the posterior is a Gibbs density, we can use the Hammersley-Clifford Theorem to identify the posterior conditionals which only depend locally on the neighboring blocks. We outline computational strategies to evaluate the conditionals, which are the target densities in the Gibbs updates, locally and in parallel. In two numerical experiments, we validate the dimension-independent properties of the MLwG algorithm and demonstrate its superior performance over MALA.</description>

      <title>Forward Propagation of Low Discrepancy Through McKean-Vlasov Dynamics: From QMC to MLQMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work develops a particle system addressing the approximation of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The novelty of the approach lies in involving low discrepancy sequences nontrivially in the construction of a particle system with coupled noise and initial conditions. Weak convergence for SDEs with additive noise is proven. A numerical study demonstrates that the novel approach presented here doubles the respective convergence rates for weak and strong approximation of the mean-field limit, compared with the standard particle system. These rates are proven in the simplified setting of a mean-field ordinary differential equation in terms of appropriate bounds involving the star discrepancy for low discrepancy sequences with a group structure, such as Rank-1 lattice points. This construction nontrivially provides an antithetic multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo estimator. An asymptotic error analysis reveals that the proposed approach outperforms methods based on the classic particle system with independent initial conditions and noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:1906.09232v2, Golovaty et al. present a $Q$-tensor model for liquid crystal dynamics which reduces to the well-known Oseen-Frank director field model in uniaxial states. We study a closely related model and present an energy stable scheme for the corresponding gradient flow. We prove the convergence of this scheme via fixed-point iteration and rigorously show the $\Gamma$-convergence of discrete minimizers as the mesh size approaches zero. In the numerical experiments, we successfully simulate isotropic-to-nematic phase transitions as expected.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary high order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of initial value problems for systems of first-order ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adaptation of the arbitrary high order ADER-DG numerical method with local DG predictor for solving the IVP for a first-order non-linear ODE system is proposed. The proposed numerical method is a completely one-step ODE solver with uniform steps, and is simple in algorithmic and software implementations. It was shown that the proposed version of the ADER-DG numerical method is A-stable and L-stable. The ADER-DG numerical method demonstrates superconvergence with convergence order 2N+1 for the solution at grid nodes, while the local solution obtained using the local DG predictor has convergence order N+1. It was demonstrated that an important applied feature of this implementation of the numerical method is the possibility of using the local solution as a solution with a subgrid resolution, which makes it possible to obtain a detailed solution even on very coarse coordinate grids. The scale of the error of the local solution, when calculating using standard representations of single or double precision floating point numbers, using large values of the degree N, practically does not differ from the error of the solution at the grid nodes. The capabilities of the ADER-DG method for solving stiff ODE systems characterized by extreme stiffness are demonstrated. Estimates of the computational costs of the ADER-DG numerical method are obtained.</description>

      <title>Approximating the signature of Brownian motion for high order SDE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature is a collection of iterated integrals describing the "shape" of a path. It appears naturally in the Taylor expansions of controlled differential equations and, as a consequence, is arguably the central object within rough path theory. In this paper, we will consider the signature of Brownian motion with time, and present both new and recently developed approximations for some of its integrals. Since these integrals (or equivalent L\'{e}vy areas) are nonlinear functions of the Brownian path, they are not Gaussian and known to be challenging to simulate. To conclude the paper, we will present some applications of these approximations to the high order numerical simulation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs).</description>

      <title>Data-free Non-intrusive Model Reduction for Nonlinear Finite Element Models via Spectral Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of spectral submanifolds (SSMs) has emerged as a powerful tool for constructing rigorous, low-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs) of high-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems. A direct computation of SSMs requires explicit knowledge of nonlinear coefficients in the equations of motion, which limits their applicability to generic finite-element (FE) solvers. Here, we propose a non-intrusive algorithm for the computation of the SSMs and the associated ROMs up to arbitrary polynomial orders. This non-intrusive algorithm only requires system nonlinearity as a black box and hence, enables SSM-based model reduction via generic finite-element software. Our expressions and algorithms are valid for systems with up to cubic-order nonlinearities, including velocity-dependent nonlinear terms, asymmetric damping, and stiffness matrices, and hence work for a large class of mechanics problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed non-intrusive approach over a variety of FE examples of increasing complexity, including a micro-resonator FE model containing more than a million degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Tailored Finite Point Operator Network for Parametric Interface Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning operators for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks has gained significant attention in recent years. However, standard approaches like Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) require extensive labeled data, and physics-informed DeepONets encounter training challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel physics-informed tailored finite point operator network (PI-TFPONet) method to solve parametric interface problems without the need for labeled data. Our method fully leverages the prior physical information of the problem, eliminating the need to include the PDE residual in the loss function, thereby avoiding training challenges. The PI-TFPONet is specifically designed to address certain properties of the problem, allowing us to naturally obtain an approximate solution that closely matches the exact solution. Our method is theoretically proven to converge if the local mesh size is sufficiently small and the training loss is minimized. Notably, our approach is uniformly convergent for singularly perturbed interface problems. Extensive numerical studies show that our unsupervised PI-TFPONet is comparable to or outperforms existing state-of-the-art supervised deep operator networks in terms of accuracy and versatility.</description>

      <title>On joint eigen-decomposition of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of approximate joint diagonalization of a collection of matrices arises in a number of diverse engineering and signal processing problems. This problem is usually cast as an optimization problem, and it is the main goal of this publication to provide a theoretical study of the corresponding cost-functional. As our main result, we prove that this functional tends to infinity in the vicinity of rank-deficient matrices with probability one, thereby proving that the optimization problem is well posed. Secondly, we provide unified expressions for its higher-order derivatives in multilinear form, and explicit expressions for the gradient and the Hessian of the functional in standard form, thereby opening for new improved numerical schemes for the solution of the joint diagonalization problem. A special section is devoted to the important case of self-adjoint matrices.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis with a 3D mixed-dimensional code for DC geoelectrical investigations of landfills: synthetic tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical resistivity tomography is a suitable technique for non-invasive monitoring of municipal solid waste landfills, but accurate sensitivity analysis is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of geoelectrical investigations and to properly design data acquisition. Commonly, a thin high-resistivity membrane in placed underneath the waste to prevent leachate leakage. In the construction of a numerical framework for sensitivity computation, taking into account the actual dimensions of the electrodes and, in particular, of the membrane, can lead to extremely high computational costs. In this work, we present a novel approach for numerically computing sensitivity effectively by adopting a mixed-dimensional framework, where the membrane is approximated as a 2D object and the electrodes as 1D objects. The code is first validated against analytical expressions for simple 4-electrode arrays and a homogeneous medium. It is then tested in simplified landfill models, where a 2D box-shaped liner separates the landfill body from the surrounding media, and 48 electrodes are used. The results show that electrodes arranged linearly along both sides of the perimeter edges of the box-shaped liner are promising for detecting liner damage, with sensitivity increasing by 2-3 orders of magnitude, even for damage as small as one-sixth of the electrode spacing in diameter. Good results are also obtained when simulating an electrical connection between the landfill and the surrounding media that is not due to liner damage. The next steps involve evaluating the minimum number of configurations needed to achieve suitable sensitivity with a manageable field effort and validating the modeling results with downscaled laboratory tests.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann framework for multiphase flows by Eulerian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) is relatively straightforward, it demands a well-crafted framework to handle the complex partial differential equations involved in multiphase flow simulations. This document presents some potential strategies for developing an Eulerian-Eulerian LBM solver tailored for multiphase systems. The paper first states what are the starting equations governing a multiphase flow in classical CFD. Secondly, it derives a pseudo-compressible (targeting the incompressible limit) system of equations for deriving the Eulerian-Eulerian LBM framework to simulate multiphase flows. Finally, a dispersed phase volume fraction equation is provided to balance the degree of freedom less due to the pressure gradient coupling. The effectiveness of these approaches can only be confirmed through rigorous numerical experimentation.</description>

      <title>A stabilized total pressure-formulation of the Biot's poroelasticity equations in frequency domain: numerical analysis and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the numerical solution of the dynamics of a poroelastic material in the frequency domain. We provide a detailed stability analysis based on the application of the Fredholm alternative in the continuous case, considering a total pressure formulation of the Biot's equations. In the discrete setting, we propose a stabilized equal order finite element method complemented by an additional pressure stabilization to enhance the robustness of the numerical scheme with respect to the fluid permeability. Utilizing the Fredholm alternative, we extend the well-posedness results to the discrete setting, obtaining theoretical optimal convergence for the case of linear finite elements. We present different numerical experiments to validate the proposed method. First, we consider model problems with known analytic solutions in two and three dimensions. As next, we show that the method is robust for a wide range of permeabilities, including the case of discontinuous coefficients. Lastly, we show the application for the simulation of brain elastography on a realistic brain geometry obtained from medical imaging.</description>

      <title>FB-HyDON: Parameter-Efficient Physics-Informed Operator Learning of Complex PDEs via Hypernetwork and Finite Basis Domain Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep operator networks (DeepONet) and neural operators have gained significant attention for their ability to map infinite-dimensional function spaces and perform zero-shot super-resolution. However, these models often require large datasets for effective training. While physics-informed operators offer a data-agnostic learning approach, they introduce additional training complexities and convergence issues, especially in highly nonlinear systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Finite Basis Physics-Informed HyperDeepONet (FB-HyDON), an advanced operator architecture featuring intrinsic domain decomposition. By leveraging hypernetworks and finite basis functions, FB-HyDON effectively mitigates the training limitations associated with existing physics-informed operator learning methods. We validated our approach on the high-frequency harmonic oscillator, Burgers' equation at different viscosity levels, and Allen-Cahn equation demonstrating substantial improvements over other operator learning models.</description>

      <title>Robust Training of Neural Networks at Arbitrary Precision and Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discontinuous operations inherent in quantization and sparsification introduce obstacles to backpropagation. This is particularly challenging when training deep neural networks in ultra-low precision and sparse regimes. We propose a novel, robust, and universal solution: a denoising affine transform that stabilizes training under these challenging conditions. By formulating quantization and sparsification as perturbations during training, we derive a perturbation-resilient approach based on ridge regression. Our solution employs a piecewise constant backbone model to ensure a performance lower bound and features an inherent noise reduction mechanism to mitigate perturbation-induced corruption. This formulation allows existing models to be trained at arbitrarily low precision and sparsity levels with off-the-shelf recipes. Furthermore, our method provides a novel perspective on training temporal binary neural networks, contributing to ongoing efforts to narrow the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.</description>

      <title>Tensor-Based Synchronization and the Low-Rankness of the Block Trifocal Tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The block tensor of trifocal tensors provides crucial geometric information on the three-view geometry of a scene. The underlying synchronization problem seeks to recover camera poses (locations and orientations up to a global transformation) from the block trifocal tensor. We establish an explicit Tucker factorization of this tensor, revealing a low multilinear rank of $(6,4,4)$ independent of the number of cameras under appropriate scaling conditions. We prove that this rank constraint provides sufficient information for camera recovery in the noiseless case. The constraint motivates a synchronization algorithm based on the higher-order singular value decomposition of the block trifocal tensor. Experimental comparisons with state-of-the-art global synchronization methods on real datasets demonstrate the potential of this algorithm for significantly improving location estimation accuracy. Overall this work suggests that higher-order interactions in synchronization problems can be exploited to improve performance, beyond the usual pairwise-based approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of centrifugal clutch systems integrated with a two-speed automatic transmission, a key component in automotive torque transfer. Centrifugal clutches enable torque transmission based on rotational speed without external controls. The study systematically examines various clutch configurations effects on transmission dynamics, focusing on torque transfer, upshifting, and downshifting behaviors under different conditions. A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model predicts clutch engagement using parameters such as spring preload and shoe mass, offering an efficient alternative to complex simulations. The integration of deep learning and numerical modeling provides critical insights for optimizing clutch designs, enhancing transmission performance and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of the Ensemble Kalman Filter in the Near-Linear Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution captures the statistics of the state of a dynamical system from partial and noisy observations. Classical particle filters provably approximate this distribution in quite general settings; however they behave poorly for high dimensional problems, suffering weight collapse. This issue is circumvented by the ensemble Kalman filter which is an equal-weight interacting particle system. However, this finite particle system is only proven to approximate the true filter in the linear Gaussian case. In practice, however, it is applied in much broader settings; as a result, establishing its approximation properties more generally is important. There has been recent progress in the theoretical analysis of the algorithm, establishing stability and error estimates in non-Gaussian settings, but the assumptions on the dynamics and observation models rule out the unbounded vector fields that arise in practice and the analysis applies only to the mean field limit of the ensemble Kalman filter. The present work establishes error bounds between the filtering distribution and the finite particle ensemble Kalman filter when the model exhibits linear growth.</description>

      <title>PROSE-FD: A Multimodal PDE Foundation Model for Learning Multiple Operators for Forecasting Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose PROSE-FD, a zero-shot multimodal PDE foundational model for simultaneous prediction of heterogeneous two-dimensional physical systems related to distinct fluid dynamics settings. These systems include shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes equations with incompressible and compressible flow, regular and complex geometries, and different buoyancy settings. This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories. Our model outperforms popular operator learning, computer vision, and multi-physics models, in benchmark forward prediction tasks. We test our architecture choices with ablation studies.</description>

      <title>Variance-reduced first-order methods for deterministically constrained stochastic nonconvex optimization with strong convergence guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09906v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of deterministically constrained stochastic optimization problems. Existing methods typically aim to find an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the expected violations of both constraints and first-order stationarity are within a prescribed accuracy $\epsilon$. However, in many practical applications, it is crucial that the constraints be nearly satisfied with certainty, making such an $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point potentially undesirable due to the risk of significant constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose single-loop variance-reduced stochastic first-order methods, where the stochastic gradient of the stochastic component is computed using either a truncated recursive momentum scheme or a truncated Polyak momentum scheme for variance reduction, while the gradient of the deterministic component is computed exactly. Under the error bound condition with a parameter $\theta \geq 1$ and other suitable assumptions, we establish that the proposed methods achieve a sample complexity and first-order operation complexity of $\widetilde O(\epsilon^{-\max\{4, 2\theta\}})$ for finding a stronger $\epsilon$-stochastic stationary point, where the constraint violation is within $\epsilon$ with certainty, and the expected violation of first-order stationarity is within $\epsilon$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to develop methods with provable complexity guarantees for finding an approximate stochastic stationary point of such problems that nearly satisfies all constraints with certainty.</description>

      <title>Space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting for multidimensional detonation waves simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER-DG finite element method with LST-DG predictor and a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting was used for simulation of multidimensional reacting flows with detonation waves. The presented numerical method does not use any ideas of splitting or fractional time steps methods. The modification of the LST-DG predictor has been developed, based on a local partition of the time step in cells in which strong reactivity of the medium is observed. This approach made it possible to obtain solutions to classical problems of flows with detonation waves and strong stiffness, without significantly decreasing the time step. The results obtained show the very high applicability and efficiency of using the ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell limiting for simulating reactive flows with detonation waves. The numerical solution shows the correct formation and propagation of ZND detonation waves. The structure of detonation waves is resolved by this numerical method with subcell resolution even on coarse spatial meshes. The smooth components of the numerical solution are correctly and very accurately reproduced by the numerical method. Non-physical artifacts of the numerical solution, typical for problems with detonation waves, such as the propagation of non-physical shock waves and weak detonation fronts ahead of the main detonation front, did not arise in the results obtained. The results of simulating rather complex problems associated with the propagation of detonation waves in significantly inhomogeneous domains are presented, which show that all the main features of detonation flows are correctly reproduced by this numerical method. It can be concluded that the space-time adaptive ADER-DG-PN method with a posteriori sub-cell ADER-WENO finite-volume limiting is perfectly applicable to simulating complex reacting flows with detonation waves.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of Graph Neural Network Force Fields for Predicting Solid-State Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) promise to offer a computationally efficient alternative to ab initio simulations for complex molecular systems. However, ensuring their generalizability beyond training data is crucial for their wide application in studying solid materials. This work investigates the ability of a graph neural network (GNN)-based MLFF, trained on Lennard-Jones Argon, to describe solid-state phenomena not explicitly included during training. We assess the MLFF's performance in predicting phonon density of states (PDOS) for a perfect face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure at both zero and finite temperatures. Additionally, we evaluate vacancy migration rates and energy barriers in an imperfect crystal using direct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the string method. Notably, vacancy configurations were absent from the training data. Our results demonstrate the MLFF's capability to capture essential solid-state properties with good agreement to reference data, even for unseen configurations. We further discuss data engineering strategies to enhance the generalizability of MLFFs. The proposed set of benchmark tests and workflow for evaluating MLFF performance in describing perfect and imperfect crystals pave the way for reliable application of MLFFs in studying complex solid-state materials.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter was used to simulate non-stationary compressible multicomponent reactive flows. The multicomponent composition of the reacting medium and the reactions occurring in it were described by expanding the original system of Euler equations by a system of non-stationary convection-reaction equations. The use of this method to simulate high stiff problems associated with reactions occurring in a multicomponent medium requires the use of the adaptive change in the time step. The solution of the classical problem related to the formation and propagation of a ZND detonation wave is carried out. It was shown that the space-time adaptive ADER finite element DG method with a posteriori correction technique of solutions on subcells by the finite-volume ADER-WENO limiter can be used to simulate flows without using of splitting in directions and fractional step methods.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>

      <title>Kernel Descent -- a Novel Optimizer for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, variational quantum algorithms have garnered significant attention as a candidate approach for near-term quantum advantage using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this article we introduce kernel descent, a novel algorithm for minimizing the functions underlying variational quantum algorithms. We compare kernel descent to existing methods and carry out extensive experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. In particular, we showcase scenarios in which kernel descent outperforms gradient descent and quantum analytic descent. The algorithm follows the well-established scheme of iteratively computing classical local approximations to the objective function and subsequently executing several classical optimization steps with respect to the former. Kernel descent sets itself apart with its employment of reproducing kernel Hilbert space techniques in the construction of the local approximations -- which leads to the observed advantages.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving learning for multi-symplectic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an energy-preserving machine learning method for inferring reduced-order models (ROMs) by exploiting the multi-symplectic form of partial differential equations (PDEs). The vast majority of energy-preserving reduced-order methods use symplectic Galerkin projection to construct reduced-order Hamiltonian models by projecting the full models onto a symplectic subspace. However, symplectic projection requires the existence of fully discrete operators, and in many cases, such as black-box PDE solvers, these operators are inaccessible. In this work, we propose an energy-preserving machine learning method that can infer the dynamics of the given PDE using data only, so that the proposed framework does not depend on the fully discrete operators. In this context, the proposed method is non-intrusive. The proposed method is grey box in the sense that it requires only some basic knowledge of the multi-symplectic model at the partial differential equation level. We prove that the proposed method satisfies spatially discrete local energy conservation and preserves the multi-symplectic conservation laws. We test our method on the linear wave equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation, and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. We test the generalization of our learned models by testing them far outside the training time interval.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the convergence rate of Orthomin(k) for a class of linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:1109.2669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we show that the convergence rate of Orthomin($k$) applied to systems of the form $(I+\rho U) x = b$, where $U$ is a unitary operator and $0&lt;\rho&lt;1$, is less than or equal to $\rho$. Moreover, we give examples of operators $U$ and $\rho&gt;0$ for which the asymptotic convergence rate of Orthomin($k$) is exactly $\rho$, thus showing that the estimate is sharp. While the systems under scrutiny may not be of great interest in themselves, their existence shows that, in general, Orthomin($k$) does not converge faster than Orthomin(1). Furthermore, we give examples of systems for which Orthomin($k$) has the same asymptotic convergence rate as Orthomin(2) for $k\ge 2$, but smaller than that of Orthomin(1). The latter systems are related to the numerical solution of certain partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied an anisotropic modified Crouzeix--Raviart finite element method for the rotational form of a stationary incompressible Navier--Stokes equation with large irrotational body forces. We present an anisotropic $H^1$ error estimate for the velocity of the modified Crouzeix--Raviart finite element method for the Navier--Stokes equation. The modified Crouzeix--Raviart finite element scheme was obtained using a lifting operator that mapped the velocity test functions to $H(\div;\Omega)$-conforming finite element spaces. Because no shape-regularity mesh conditions are imposed, anisotropic meshes can be used for the analysis. The core idea of the proof involves using the relation between the Raviart--Thomas and Crouzeix--Raviart finite element spaces. Furthermore, we present a discrete Sobolev inequality under semi-regular mesh conditions to estimate the stability of the proposed method, and confirm the results obtained through numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of the ground states of special multi-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) can be formulated as an energy functional minimization problem with spherical constraints. It leads to a nonconvex quartic-quadratic optimization problem after suitable discretizations. First, we generalize the Newton-based methods for single-component BECs to the alternating minimization scheme for multi-component BECs. Second, the global convergent alternating Newton-Noda iteration (ANNI) is proposed. In particular, we prove the positivity preserving property of ANNI under mild conditions. Finally, our analysis is applied to a class of more general "multi-block" optimization problems with spherical constraints. Numerical experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of proposed methods for different multi-component BECs, including pseudo spin-1/2, anti-ferromagnetic spin-1 and spin-2 BECs. These results support our theory and demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The reduction of Hamiltonian systems aims to build smaller reduced models, valid over a certain range of time and parameters, in order to reduce computing time. By maintaining the Hamiltonian structure in the reduced model, certain long-term stability properties can be preserved. In this paper, we propose a non-linear reduction method for models coming from the spatial discretization of partial differential equations: it is based on convolutional auto-encoders and Hamiltonian neural networks. Their training is coupled in order to simultaneously learn the encoder-decoder operators and the reduced dynamics. Several test cases on non-linear wave dynamics show that the method has better reduction properties than standard linear Hamiltonian reduction methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new theoretical and computational framework for a data driven Koopman mode analysis of nonlinear dynamics. To alleviate the potential problem of ill-conditioned eigenvectors in the existing implementations of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), the new method introduces a Koopman-Schur decomposition that is entirely based on unitary transformations. The analysis in terms of the eigenvectors as modes of a Koopman operator compression is replaced with a modal decomposition in terms of a flag of invariant subspaces that correspond to selected eigenvalues. The main computational tool from the numerical linear algebra is the partial ordered Schur decomposition that provides convenient orthonormal bases for these subspaces. In the case of real data, a real Schur form is used and the computation is based on real orthogonal transformations. The new computational scheme is presented in the framework of the Extended DMD and the kernel trick is used.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Problems Approach to Pulse Wave Analysis in the Human Brain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac pulsations in the human brain have received recent interest due to their possible role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Further interest stems from their possible application as an endogenous signal source that can be utilized for brain imaging in general. The (pulse-)wave describing the blood flow velocity along an intracranial artery consists of a forward (anterograde) and a backward (retrograde, reflected) part, but measurements of this wave usually consist of a superposition of these components. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for the inverse problem of estimating the pulse wave velocity, as well as the forward and backward component of the pulse wave separately from MRI measurements on intracranial arteries. After a mathematical analysis of this problem, we consider possible reconstruction approaches, and derive an alternate direction approach for its solution. The resulting methods provide estimates for anterograde/retrograde wave forms and the pulse wave velocity under specified assumptions on a cerebrovascular model system. Numerical experiments on simulated and experimental data demonstrate the applicability and preliminary in vivo feasibility of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Improving the accuracy of the Newmark method through backward error analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use backward error analysis for differential equations to obtain modified or distorted equations describing the behaviour of the Newmark scheme applied to the transient structural dynamics equation. Based on the newly derived distorted equations, we give expressions for the numerically or algorithmically distorted stiffness and damping matrices of a system simulated using the Newmark scheme. Using these results, we show how to construct compensation terms from the original parameters of the system, which improve the performance of Newmark simulations. The required compensation terms turn out to be slight modifications to the original system parameters (e.g. the damping or stiffness matrices), and can be applied without changing the time step or modifying the scheme itself. Two such compensations are given: one eliminates numerical damping, while the other achieves fourth-order accurate calculations using the traditionally second-order Newmark method. The performance of both compensation methods is evaluated numerically to demonstrate their validity, and they are compared to the uncompensated Newmark method, the generalized-$\alpha$ method and the 4th-order Runge--Kutta scheme.</description>

      <title>Unique reconstruction for discretized inverse problems: a random sketching approach via subsampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical inverse problems are often studied in an ideal infinite-dimensional setting. The well-posedness theory provides a unique reconstruction of the parameter function, when an infinite amount of data is given. Through the lens of PDE-constrained optimization, this means one attains the zero-loss property of the mismatch function in this setting. This is no longer true in computations when we are limited to finite amount of measurements due to experimental or economical reasons. Consequently, one must compromise the goal, from inferring a function, to a discrete approximation.
  What is the reconstruction power of a fixed number of data observations? How many parameters can one reconstruct? Here we describe a probabilistic approach, and spell out the interplay of the observation size $(r)$ and the number of parameters to be uniquely identified $(m)$. The technical pillar here is the random sketching strategy, in which the matrix concentration inequality and sampling theory are largely employed. By analyzing a randomly subsampled Hessian matrix, we attain a well-conditioned reconstruction problem with high probability. Our main theory is validated in numerical experiments, using an elliptic inverse problem as an example.</description>

      <title>Entropy Increasing Numerical Methods for Prediction of Reversible and Irreversible Heating in Supercapacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate characterization of entropy plays a pivotal role in capturing reversible and irreversible heating in supercapacitors during charging/discharging cycles. However, numerical methods that can faithfully capture entropy variation in supercapacitors are still in lack. This work develops first-order and second-order finite-volume schemes for the prediction of non-isothermal electrokinetics in supercapacitors. Semi-implicit discretization that decouples temperature from ionic concentrations and electric potential results in an efficient first-order accurate scheme. Its numerical analysis theoretically establishes the unique solvability of the nonlinear scheme with the existence of positive ionic concentrations and temperature at discrete level. To obtain an entropy-increasing second-order scheme, a modified Crank-Nicolson approach is proposed for discretization of the logarithm of both temperature and ionic concentrations, which is employed to enforce numerical positivity. Moreover, numerical analysis rigorously demonstrates that both first-order and second-order schemes are able to unconditionally preserve ionic mass conservation and original entropy increase for a closed, thermally insulated supercapacitor. Extensive numerical simulations show that the proposed schemes have expected accuracy and robust performance in preserving the desired properties. Temperature oscillation in the charging/discharging processes is successfully predicted, unraveling a quadratic scaling law of temperature rising slope against voltage scanning rate. It is also demonstrated that the variation of ionic entropy contribution, which is the underlying mechanism responsible for reversible heating, is faithfully captured. Our work provides a promising tool in predicting reversible and irreversible heating in supercapacitors.</description>

      <title>Efficient and provably convergent randomized greedy algorithms for neural network optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Greedy algorithms have been successfully analyzed and applied in training neural networks for solving variational problems, ensuring guaranteed convergence orders. However, their practical applicability is limited due to the subproblems, which often require an exhaustive search over a discrete dictionary and incur significant computational costs. This limitation becomes critical, especially in high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we propose a more practical approach of randomly discretizing the dictionary at each iteration of the greedy algorithm. We quantify the required size of the randomized discrete dictionary and prove that, with high probability, the proposed algorithm realizes a weak greedy algorithm, achieving optimal convergence orders. Through numerous numerical experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of using randomized discrete dictionaries over a deterministic one by showing orders of magnitude reductions in the size of the discrete dictionary, particularly in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generating customized field concentration via virtue surface transmission resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for generating strong customized field concentration locally around the inhomogeneous medium inclusion via surface transmission resonance. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we show that for a given inclusion embedded in an otherwise uniformly homogeneous background space, we can design an incident field to generate strong localized field concentration at any specified places around the inclusion. The aforementioned customized field concentration is crucially reliant on the peculiar spectral and geometric patterns of certain transmission eigenfunctions. Secondly, we prove the existence of a sequence of transmission eigenfunctions for a specific wavenumber and they exhibit distinct surface resonant behaviors, accompanying strong surface-localization and surface-oscillation properties. These eigenfunctions as the surface transmission resonant modes fulfill the requirement for generating the field concentration.</description>

Abstract: The area of inverse problems in mathematics is highly interdisciplinary. In various fields of science, engineering, medicine, and industry, there arises a need to reconstruct information about unknown entities that cannot be directly observed. Examples include medical imaging techniques such as X-ray CT and optical tomography. Indeed, the mathematics of inverse problems has often originated from challenges posed by other fields. Inverse problems are often ill-posed and solutions are unstable. In this lecture, we will explore methods to solve such inverse problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nernst-Planck model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the behavior of electrolyte systems. However, inherent deficiencies in this model have spurred the exploration of alternative approaches. In this context, this study presents simulation in multidimensional contexts for a new, fully-coupled, non-linear, thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model introduced by Dreyer et al. We present a robust mathematical formulation and employ a conforming finite element approximation to comprehensively explore both compressible and incompressible variants of the electrolyte mixture. Our investigation extends across diverse spatial dimensions, facilitating an in-depth analysis of parametric dependencies governing space-charge layer formation at boundaries under external voltage influence. Furthermore, meticulous consideration is given to finite ion size effects, which play a critical role in electrolyte flow dynamics. Insights from annular battery designs are also incorporated, which introduce unique dynamics to ion transport phenomena. Through rigorous simulations, we validate the accuracy and reliability of our numerical scheme, thereby laying the groundwork for an enhanced understanding and optimization of electrolyte system behaviors across various applications, notably in semiconductor devices and electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Approximation by non-symmetric networks for cross-domain learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03890v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the past 30 years or so, machine learning has stimulated a great deal of research in the study of approximation capabilities (expressive power) of a multitude of processes, such as approximation by shallow or deep neural networks, radial basis function networks, and a variety of kernel based methods. Motivated by applications such as invariant learning, transfer learning, and synthetic aperture radar imaging, we initiate in this paper a general approach to study the approximation capabilities of kernel based networks using non-symmetric kernels. While singular value decomposition is a natural instinct to study such kernels, we consider a more general approach to include the use of a family of kernels, such as generalized translation networks (which include neural networks and translation invariant kernels as special cases) and rotated zonal function kernels. Naturally, unlike traditional kernel based approximation, we cannot require the kernels to be positive definite. In particular, we obtain estimates on the accuracy of uniform approximation of functions in a Sobolev class by ReLU$^r$ networks when $r$ is not necessarily an integer. Our general results apply to the approximation of functions with small smoothness compared to the dimension of the input space.</description>

      <title>Improving the Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) stochastic optimizer through an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) time-stepping approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer, often used in Machine Learning for neural network training, corresponds to an underlying ordinary differential equation (ODE) in the limit of very small learning rates. This work shows that the classical Adam algorithm is a first-order implicit-explicit (IMEX) Euler discretization of the underlying ODE. Employing the time discretization point of view, we propose new extensions of the Adam scheme obtained by using higher-order IMEX methods to solve the ODE. Based on this approach, we derive a new optimization algorithm for neural network training that performs better than classical Adam on several regression and classification problems.</description>

      <title>Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Formulation of the Role of Shear Loads on Multi-Layered Thin Shells and Classification of Their Deformation Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shell structures are generally modeled based on kinematic hypotheses, where some of the parameters are preferentially evaluated in a phenomenological manner. In this article, asymptotic analysis against the underlying three-dimensional equation system is considered so as to provide a rational framework for modeling and interpreting the deformation behavior of multi-layered thin shells (MTSs). Capable of accurate predictions of not only the overall stiffness of MTSs, but also the detailed stress distribution, the proposed shell theory shows its distinguishing features at least in the following aspects. Firstly, it naturally introduces a rule for classifying the deformation modes of MTSs. One mode resembles a plate, where the transverse load is withstood through bending, while the other is like a supporting structure, where the load gets conducted to adjacent inclined sections. Secondly, in contrast with the existing arguments where an applied shear load on the shell surface necessitates the inclusion of transverse shear stresses for analysis, it is demonstrated that a leading-order multi-layered shell theory derived from asymptotic analysis should suffice to output satisfactory predictions over the shell stiffness, as well as its internal stress distribution. Numerical examples of the deformation and strength analysis for MTSs are also presented to show the reliability of the leading-order model.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian Vortex Method on Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an Eulerian vortex method based on the theory of flow maps to simulate the complex vortical motions of incompressible fluids. Central to our method is the novel incorporation of the flow-map transport equations for line elements, which, in combination with a bi-directional marching scheme for flow maps, enables the high-fidelity Eulerian advection of vorticity variables. The fundamental motivation is that, compared to impulse $\mathbf{m}$, which has been recently bridged with flow maps to encouraging results, vorticity $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ promises to be preferable for its numerical stability and physical interpretability. To realize the full potential of this novel formulation, we develop a new Poisson solving scheme for vorticity-to-velocity reconstruction that is both efficient and able to accurately handle the coupling near solid boundaries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with a range of vortex simulation examples, including leapfrog vortices, vortex collisions, cavity flow, and the formation of complex vortical structures due to solid-fluid interactions.</description>
