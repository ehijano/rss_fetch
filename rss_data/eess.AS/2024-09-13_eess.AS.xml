      <title>SSR-Speech: Towards Stable, Safe and Robust Zero-shot Text-based Speech Editing and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SSR-Speech, a neural codec autoregressive model designed for stable, safe, and robust zero-shot text-based speech editing and text-to-speech synthesis. SSR-Speech is built on a Transformer decoder and incorporates classifier-free guidance to enhance the stability of the generation process. A watermark Encodec is proposed to embed frame-level watermarks into the edited regions of the speech so that which parts were edited can be detected. In addition, the waveform reconstruction leverages the original unedited speech segments, providing superior recovery compared to the Encodec model. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the RealEdit speech editing task and the LibriTTS text-to-speech task, surpassing previous methods. Furthermore, SSR-Speech excels in multi-span speech editing and also demonstrates remarkable robustness to background sounds. Source code and demos are released.</description>

      <title>Super Monotonic Alignment Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monotonic alignment search (MAS), introduced by Glow-TTS, is one of the most popular algorithm in TTS to estimate unknown alignments between text and speech. Since this algorithm needs to search for the most probable alignment with dynamic programming by caching all paths, the time complexity of the algorithm is $O(T \times S)$. The authors of Glow-TTS run this algorithm on CPU, and while they mentioned it is difficult to parallelize, we found that MAS can be parallelized in text-length dimension and CPU execution consumes an inordinate amount of time for inter-device copy. Therefore, we implemented a Triton kernel and PyTorch JIT script to accelerate MAS on GPU without inter-device copy. As a result, Super-MAS Triton kernel is up to 72 times faster in the extreme-length case. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/supertone-inc/super-monotonic-align}.</description>

      <title>Music auto-tagging in the long tail: A few-shot approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of digital music, using tags to efficiently organize and retrieve music from extensive databases is crucial for music catalog owners. Human tagging by experts is labor-intensive but mostly accurate, whereas automatic tagging through supervised learning has approached satisfying accuracy but is restricted to a predefined set of training tags. Few-shot learning offers a viable solution to expand beyond this small set of predefined tags by enabling models to learn from only a few human-provided examples to understand tag meanings and subsequently apply these tags autonomously. We propose to integrate few-shot learning methodology into multi-label music auto-tagging by using features from pre-trained models as inputs to a lightweight linear classifier, also known as a linear probe. We investigate different popular pre-trained features, as well as different few-shot parametrizations with varying numbers of classes and samples per class. Our experiments demonstrate that a simple model with pre-trained features can achieve performance close to state-of-the-art models while using significantly less training data, such as 20 samples per tag. Additionally, our linear probe performs competitively with leading models when trained on the entire training dataset. The results show that this transfer learning-based few-shot approach could effectively address the issue of automatically assigning long-tail tags with only limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Universal Pooling Method of Multi-layer Features from Pretrained Models for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in automatic speaker verification (ASV) studies have been achieved by leveraging large-scale pretrained networks. In this study, we analyze the approaches toward such a paradigm and underline the significance of interlayer information processing as a result. Accordingly, we present a novel approach for exploiting the multilayered nature of pretrained models for ASV, which comprises a layer/frame-level network and two steps of pooling architectures for each layer and frame axis. Specifically, we let convolutional architecture directly processes a stack of layer outputs.Then, we present a channel attention-based scheme of gauging layer significance and squeeze the layer level with the most representative value. Finally, attentive statistics over frame-level representations yield a single vector speaker embedding. Comparative experiments are designed using versatile data environments and diverse pretraining models to validate the proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate the stability of the approach using multi-layer outputs in leveraging pretrained architectures. Then, we verify the superiority of the proposed ASV backend structure, which involves layer-wise operations, in terms of performance improvement along with cost efficiency compared to the conventional method. The ablation study shows how the proposed interlayer processing aids in maximizing the advantage of utilizing pretrained models.</description>

      <title>Audio Decoding by Inverse Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider audio decoding as an inverse problem and solve it through diffusion posterior sampling. Explicit conditioning functions are developed for input signal measurements provided by an example of a transform domain perceptual audio codec. Viability is demonstrated by evaluating arbitrary pairings of a set of bitrates and task-agnostic prior models. For instance, we observe significant improvements on piano while maintaining speech performance when a speech model is replaced by a joint model trained on both speech and piano. With a more general music model, improved decoding compared to legacy methods is obtained for a broad range of content types and bitrates. The noisy mean model, underlying the proposed derivation of conditioning, enables a significant reduction of gradient evaluations for diffusion posterior sampling, compared to methods based on Tweedie's mean. Combining Tweedie's mean with our conditioning functions improves the objective performance. An audio demo is available at https://dpscodec-demo.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Defending Against Adversarial Attacks on Automatic Speech Recognition via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper addresses detection and defence against targeted white-box attacks on speech signals for ASR systems. While existing work has utilised diffusion models (DMs) to purify adversarial examples, achieving state-of-the-art results in keyword spotting tasks, their effectiveness for more complex tasks such as sentence-level ASR remains unexplored. Additionally, the impact of the number of forward diffusion steps on performance is not well understood. In this paper, we systematically investigate the use of DMs for defending against adversarial attacks on sentences and examine the effect of varying forward diffusion steps. Through comprehensive experiments on the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, we demonstrate that two forward diffusion steps can completely defend against adversarial attacks on sentences. Moreover, we introduce a novel, training-free approach for detecting adversarial attacks by leveraging a pre-trained DM. Our experimental results show that this method can detect adversarial attacks with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Auto-Landmark: Acoustic Landmark Dataset and Open-Source Toolkit for Landmark Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the speech signal, acoustic landmarks identify times when the acoustic manifestations of the linguistically motivated distinctive features are most salient. Acoustic landmarks have been widely applied in various domains, including speech recognition, speech depression detection, clinical analysis of speech abnormalities, and the detection of disordered speech. However, there is currently no dataset available that provides precise timing information for landmarks, which has been proven to be crucial for downstream applications involving landmarks. In this paper, we selected the most useful acoustic landmarks based on previous research and annotated the TIMIT dataset with them, based on a combination of phoneme boundary information and manual inspection. Moreover, previous landmark extraction tools were not open source or benchmarked, so to address this, we developed an open source Python-based landmark extraction tool and established a series of landmark detection baselines. The first of their kinds, the dataset with landmark precise timing information, landmark extraction tool and baselines are designed to support a wide variety of future research.</description>

      <title>Faster Speech-LLaMA Inference with Multi-token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at solving a wide variety of tasks, including those involving multi-modal inputs. In particular, instantiating an LLM (such as LLaMA) with a speech encoder and training it on paired data imparts speech recognition (ASR) abilities to the decoder-only model, hence called Speech-LLaMA. Nevertheless, due to the sequential nature of auto-regressive inference and the relatively large decoder, Speech-LLaMA models require relatively high inference time. In this work, we propose to speed up Speech-LLaMA inference by predicting multiple tokens in the same decoding step. We explore several model architectures that enable this, and investigate their performance using threshold-based and verification-based inference strategies. We also propose a prefix-based beam search decoding method that allows efficient minimum word error rate (MWER) training for such models. We evaluate our models on a variety of public benchmarks, where they reduce the number of decoder calls by ~3.2x while maintaining or improving WER performance.</description>

      <title>Dark Experience for Incremental Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken keyword spotting (KWS) is crucial for identifying keywords within audio inputs and is widely used in applications like Apple Siri and Google Home, particularly on edge devices. Current deep learning-based KWS systems, which are typically trained on a limited set of keywords, can suffer from performance degradation when encountering new domains, a challenge often addressed through few-shot fine-tuning. However, this adaptation frequently leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance on original data deteriorates. Progressive continual learning (CL) strategies have been proposed to overcome this, but they face limitations such as the need for task-ID information and increased storage, making them less practical for lightweight devices. To address these challenges, we introduce Dark Experience for Keyword Spotting (DE-KWS), a novel CL approach that leverages dark knowledge to distill past experiences throughout the training process. DE-KWS combines rehearsal and distillation, using both ground truth labels and logits stored in a memory buffer to maintain model performance across tasks. Evaluations on the Google Speech Command dataset show that DE-KWS outperforms existing CL baselines in average accuracy without increasing model size, offering an effective solution for resource-constrained edge devices. The scripts are available on GitHub for the future research.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Symbolic Pop Music Generation with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Music is inherently made up of complex structures, and representing them as graphs helps to capture multiple levels of relationships. While music generation has been explored using various deep generation techniques, research on graph-related music generation is sparse. Earlier graph-based music generation worked only on generating melodies, and recent works to generate polyphonic music do not account for longer-term structure. In this paper, we explore a multi-graph approach to represent both the rhythmic patterns and phrase structure of Chinese pop music. Consequently, we propose a two-step approach that aims to generate polyphonic music with coherent rhythm and long-term structure. We train two Variational Auto-Encoder networks - one on a MIDI dataset to generate 4-bar phrases, and another on song structure labels to generate full song structure. Our work shows that the models are able to learn most of the structural nuances in the training dataset, including chord and pitch frequency distributions, and phrase attributes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparse Coding with the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm for Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers are exploring novel computational paradigms such as sparse coding and neuromorphic computing to bridge the efficiency gap between the human brain and conventional computers in complex tasks. A key area of focus is neuromorphic audio processing. While the Locally Competitive Algorithm has emerged as a promising solution for sparse coding, offering potential for real-time and low-power processing on neuromorphic hardware, its applications in neuromorphic speech classification have not been thoroughly studied. The Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm builds upon the Locally Competitive Algorithm by dynamically adjusting the modulation parameters of the filter bank to fine-tune the filters' sensitivity. This adaptability enhances lateral inhibition, improving reconstruction quality, sparsity, and convergence time, which is crucial for real-time applications. This paper demonstrates the potential of the Locally Competitive Algorithm and its adaptive variant as robust feature extractors for neuromorphic speech classification. Results show that the Locally Competitive Algorithm achieves better speech classification accuracy at the expense of higher power consumption compared to the LAUSCHER cochlea model used for benchmarking. On the other hand, the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm mitigates this power consumption issue without compromising the accuracy. The dynamic power consumption is reduced to a range of 0.004 to 13 milliwatts on neuromorphic hardware, three orders of magnitude less than setups using Graphics Processing Units. These findings position the Adaptive Locally Competitive Algorithm as a compelling solution for efficient speech classification systems, promising substantial advancements in balancing speech classification accuracy and power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Improved Visually Prompted Keyword Localisation in Real Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an image query, visually prompted keyword localisation (VPKL) aims to find occurrences of the depicted word in a speech collection. This can be useful when transcriptions are not available for a low-resource language (e.g. if it is unwritten). Previous work showed that VPKL can be performed with a visually grounded speech model trained on paired images and unlabelled speech. But all experiments were done on English. Moreover, transcriptions were used to get positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. This paper introduces a few-shot learning scheme to mine pairs automatically without transcriptions. On English, this results in only a small drop in performance. We also - for the first time - consider VPKL on a real low-resource language, Yoruba. While scores are reasonable, here we see a bigger drop in performance compared to using ground truth pairs because the mining is less accurate in Yoruba.</description>

      <title>Flexible Control in Symbolic Music Generation via Musical Metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the demonstration of symbolic music generation, focusing on providing short musical motifs that serve as the central theme of the narrative. For the generation, we adopt an autoregressive model which takes musical metadata as inputs and generates 4 bars of multitrack MIDI sequences. During training, we randomly drop tokens from the musical metadata to guarantee flexible control. It provides users with the freedom to select input types while maintaining generative performance, enabling greater flexibility in music composition. We validate the effectiveness of the strategy through experiments in terms of model capacity, musical fidelity, diversity, and controllability. Additionally, we scale up the model and compare it with other music generation model through a subjective test. Our results indicate its superiority in both control and music quality. We provide a URL link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0drPrFJdMQ to our demonstration video.</description>

      <title>FlowSep: Language-Queried Sound Separation with Rectified Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) focuses on separating sounds using textual descriptions of the desired sources. Current methods mainly use discriminative approaches, such as time-frequency masking, to separate target sounds and minimize interference from other sources. However, these models face challenges when separating overlapping soundtracks, which may lead to artifacts such as spectral holes or incomplete separation. Rectified flow matching (RFM), a generative model that establishes linear relations between the distribution of data and noise, offers superior theoretical properties and simplicity, but has not yet been explored in sound separation. In this work, we introduce FlowSep, a new generative model based on RFM for LASS tasks. FlowSep learns linear flow trajectories from noise to target source features within the variational autoencoder (VAE) latent space. During inference, the RFM-generated latent features are reconstructed into a mel-spectrogram via the pre-trained VAE decoder, followed by a pre-trained vocoder to synthesize the waveform. Trained on 1,680 hours of audio data, FlowSep outperforms the state-of-the-art models across multiple benchmarks, as evaluated with subjective and objective metrics. Additionally, our results show that FlowSep surpasses a diffusion-based LASS model in both separation quality and inference efficiency, highlighting its strong potential for audio source separation tasks. Code, pre-trained models and demos can be found at: https://audio-agi.github.io/FlowSep_demo/.</description>

      <title>Full-text Error Correction for Chinese Speech Recognition with Large Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential for error correction in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most research focuses on utterances from short-duration speech recordings, which are the predominant form of speech data for supervised ASR training. This paper investigates the effectiveness of LLMs for error correction in full-text generated by ASR systems from longer speech recordings, such as transcripts from podcasts, news broadcasts, and meetings. First, we develop a Chinese dataset for full-text error correction, named ChFT, utilizing a pipeline that involves text-to-speech synthesis, ASR, and error-correction pair extractor. This dataset enables us to correct errors across contexts, including both full-text and segment, and to address a broader range of error types, such as punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization, thus making the correction process comprehensive. Second, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM on the constructed dataset using a diverse set of prompts and target formats, and evaluate its performance on full-text error correction. Specifically, we design prompts based on full-text and segment, considering various output formats, such as directly corrected text and JSON-based error-correction pairs. Through various test settings, including homogeneous, up-to-date, and hard test sets, we find that the fine-tuned LLMs perform well in the full-text setting with different prompts, each presenting its own strengths and weaknesses. This establishes a promising baseline for further research. The dataset is available on the website.</description>

      <title>Bridging Paintings and Music -- Exploring Emotion based Music Generation through Paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced generative tasks involving music and images, employing both unimodal and multimodal approaches. This research develops a model capable of generating music that resonates with the emotions depicted in visual arts, integrating emotion labeling, image captioning, and language models to transform visual inputs into musical compositions. Addressing the scarcity of aligned art and music data, we curated the Emotion Painting Music Dataset, pairing paintings with corresponding music for effective training and evaluation. Our dual-stage framework converts images to text descriptions of emotional content and then transforms these descriptions into music, facilitating efficient learning with minimal data. Performance is evaluated using metrics such as Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), Inception Score (IS), and KL divergence, with audio-emotion text similarity confirmed by the pre-trained CLAP model to demonstrate high alignment between generated music and text. This synthesis tool bridges visual art and music, enhancing accessibility for the visually impaired and opening avenues in educational and therapeutic applications by providing enriched multi-sensory experiences.</description>

      <title>TSELM: Target Speaker Extraction using Discrete Tokens and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose TSELM, a novel target speaker extraction network that leverages discrete tokens and language models. TSELM utilizes multiple discretized layers from WavLM as input tokens and incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to integrate target speaker information. Language models are employed to capture the sequence dependencies, while a scalable HiFi-GAN is used to reconstruct the audio from the tokens. By applying a cross-entropy loss, TSELM models the probability distribution of output tokens, thus converting the complex regression problem of audio generation into a classification task. Experimental results show that TSELM achieves excellent results in speech quality and comparable results in speech intelligibility.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Parkinsons Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the promising performance of state of the art approaches for Parkinsons Disease (PD) detection, these approaches often analyze individual speech segments in isolation, which can lead to suboptimal results. Dysarthric cues that characterize speech impairments from PD patients are expected to be related across segments from different speakers. Isolated segment analysis fails to exploit these inter segment relationships. Additionally, not all speech segments from PD patients exhibit clear dysarthric symptoms, introducing label noise that can negatively affect the performance and generalizability of current approaches. To address these challenges, we propose a novel PD detection framework utilizing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). By representing speech segments as nodes and capturing the similarity between segments through edges, our GCN model facilitates the aggregation of dysarthric cues across the graph, effectively exploiting segment relationships and mitigating the impact of label noise. Experimental results demonstrate theadvantages of the proposed GCN model for PD detection and provide insights into its underlying mechanisms</description>

      <title>A corpus-based investigation of pitch contours of monosyllabic words in conversational Taiwan Mandarin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Mandarin, the tonal contours of monosyllabic words produced in isolation or in careful speech are characterized by four lexical tones: a high-level tone (T1), a rising tone (T2), a dipping tone (T3) and a falling tone (T4). However, in spontaneous speech, the actual tonal realization of monosyllabic words can deviate significantly from these canonical tones due to intra-syllabic co-articulation and inter-syllabic co-articulation with adjacent tones. In addition, Chuang et al. (2024) recently reported that the tonal contours of disyllabic Mandarin words with T2-T4 tone pattern are co-determined by their meanings. Following up on their research, we present a corpus-based investigation of how the pitch contours of monosyllabic words are realized in spontaneous conversational Mandarin, focusing on the effects of contextual predictors on the one hand, and the way in words' meanings co-determine pitch contours on the other hand. We analyze the F0 contours of 3824 tokens of 63 different word types in a spontaneous Taiwan Mandarin corpus, using the generalized additive (mixed) model to decompose a given observed pitch contour into a set of component pitch contours. We show that the tonal context substantially modify a word's canonical tone. Once the effect of tonal context is controlled for, T2 and T3 emerge as low flat tones, contrasting with T1 as a high tone, and with T4 as a high-to-mid falling tone. The neutral tone (T0), which in standard descriptions, is realized based on the preceding tone, emerges as a low tone in its own right, modified by the other predictors in the same way as the standard tones T1, T2, T3, and T4. We also show that word, and even more so, word sense, co-determine words' F0 contours. Analyses of variable importance using random forests further supported the substantial effect of tonal context and an effect of word sense.</description>

      <title>Tidal MerzA: Combining affective modelling and autonomous code generation through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Tidal-MerzA, a novel system designed for collaborative performances between humans and a machine agent in the context of live coding, specifically focusing on the generation of musical patterns. Tidal-MerzA fuses two foundational models: ALCAA (Affective Live Coding Autonomous Agent) and Tidal Fuzz, a computational framework. By integrating affective modelling with computational generation, this system leverages reinforcement learning techniques to dynamically adapt music composition parameters within the TidalCycles framework, ensuring both affective qualities to the patterns and syntactical correctness. The development of Tidal-MerzA introduces two distinct agents: one focusing on the generation of mini-notation strings for musical expression, and another on the alignment of music with targeted affective states through reinforcement learning. This approach enhances the adaptability and creative potential of live coding practices and allows exploration of human-machine creative interactions. Tidal-MerzA advances the field of computational music generation, presenting a novel methodology for incorporating artificial intelligence into artistic practices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative Zero-Shot any-to-any Singing Voice Conversion (SVC) method, leveraging a novel clustering-based phoneme representation to effectively separate content, timbre, and singing style. This approach enables precise voice characteristic manipulation. We discovered that datasets with fewer recordings per artist are more susceptible to timbre leakage. Extensive testing on over 10,000 hours of singing and user feedback revealed our model significantly improves sound quality and timbre accuracy, aligning with our objectives and advancing voice conversion technology. Furthermore, this research advances zero-shot SVC and sets the stage for future work on discrete speech representation, emphasizing the preservation of rhyme.</description>

      <title>The Faetar Benchmark: Speech Recognition in a Very Under-Resourced Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Faetar Automatic Speech Recognition Benchmark, a benchmark corpus designed to push the limits of current approaches to low-resource speech recognition. Faetar, a Franco-Proven\c{c}al variety spoken primarily in Italy, has no standard orthography, has virtually no existing textual or speech resources other than what is included in the benchmark, and is quite different from other forms of Franco-Proven\c{c}al. The corpus comes from field recordings, most of which are noisy, for which only 5 hrs have matching transcriptions, and for which forced alignment is of variable quality. The corpus contains an additional 20 hrs of unlabelled speech. We report baseline results from state-of-the-art multilingual speech foundation models with a best phone error rate of 30.4%, using a pipeline that continues pre-training on the foundation model using the unlabelled set.</description>

      <title>AudioBERT: Audio Knowledge Augmented Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified that language models, pretrained on text-only datasets, often lack elementary visual knowledge, \textit{e.g.,} colors of everyday objects. Motivated by this observation, we ask whether a similar shortcoming exists in terms of the \textit{auditory} knowledge. To answer this question, we construct a new dataset called AuditoryBench, which consists of two novel tasks for evaluating auditory knowledge. Based on our analysis using the benchmark, we find that language models also suffer from a severe lack of auditory knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose AudioBERT, a novel method to augment the auditory knowledge of BERT through a retrieval-based approach. First, we detect auditory knowledge spans in prompts to query our retrieval model efficiently. Then, we inject audio knowledge into BERT and switch on low-rank adaptation for effective adaptation when audio knowledge is required. Our experiments demonstrate that AudioBERT is quite effective, achieving superior performance on the AuditoryBench. The dataset and code are available at \bulurl{https://github.com/HJ-Ok/AudioBERT}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial filters can exploit deep-learning-based speech enhancement models to increase their reliability in scenarios with multiple speech sources scenarios. To further improve speech quality, it is common to perform postfiltering on the estimated target speech obtained with spatial filtering. In this work, Generalized Eigenvalue (GEV) beamforming is employed to provide the leakage estimation, along with the estimation of the target speech, to be later used for postfiltering. This improves the enhancement performance over a postfilter that uses the target speech and a reference microphone signal. This work also demonstrates that the spatial covariance matrices (SCMs) can be accurately estimated from the direction of arrival (DoA) of the target and a discriminative selection amongst the pairwise estimated time-frequency masks.</description>

      <title>StyleSinger: Style Transfer for Out-of-Domain Singing Voice Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Style transfer for out-of-domain (OOD) singing voice synthesis (SVS) focuses on generating high-quality singing voices with unseen styles (such as timbre, emotion, pronunciation, and articulation skills) derived from reference singing voice samples. However, the endeavor to model the intricate nuances of singing voice styles is an arduous task, as singing voices possess a remarkable degree of expressiveness. Moreover, existing SVS methods encounter a decline in the quality of synthesized singing voices in OOD scenarios, as they rest upon the assumption that the target vocal attributes are discernible during the training phase. To overcome these challenges, we propose StyleSinger, the first singing voice synthesis model for zero-shot style transfer of out-of-domain reference singing voice samples. StyleSinger incorporates two critical approaches for enhanced effectiveness: 1) the Residual Style Adaptor (RSA) which employs a residual quantization module to capture diverse style characteristics in singing voices, and 2) the Uncertainty Modeling Layer Normalization (UMLN) to perturb the style attributes within the content representation during the training phase and thus improve the model generalization. Our extensive evaluations in zero-shot style transfer undeniably establish that StyleSinger outperforms baseline models in both audio quality and similarity to the reference singing voice samples. Access to singing voice samples can be found at https://stylesinger.github.io/.</description>

      <title>E2 TTS: Embarrassingly Easy Fully Non-Autoregressive Zero-Shot TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces Embarrassingly Easy Text-to-Speech (E2 TTS), a fully non-autoregressive zero-shot text-to-speech system that offers human-level naturalness and state-of-the-art speaker similarity and intelligibility. In the E2 TTS framework, the text input is converted into a character sequence with filler tokens. The flow-matching-based mel spectrogram generator is then trained based on the audio infilling task. Unlike many previous works, it does not require additional components (e.g., duration model, grapheme-to-phoneme) or complex techniques (e.g., monotonic alignment search). Despite its simplicity, E2 TTS achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS capabilities that are comparable to or surpass previous works, including Voicebox and NaturalSpeech 3. The simplicity of E2 TTS also allows for flexibility in the input representation. We propose several variants of E2 TTS to improve usability during inference. See https://aka.ms/e2tts/ for demo samples.</description>

      <title>Towards Unsupervised Speaker Diarization System for Multilingual Telephone Calls Using Pre-trained Whisper Model and Mixture of Sparse Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing speaker diarization systems typically rely on large amounts of manually annotated data, which is labor-intensive and difficult to obtain, especially in real-world scenarios. Additionally, language-specific constraints in these systems significantly hinder their effectiveness and scalability in multilingual settings. In this paper, we propose a cluster-based speaker diarization system designed for multilingual telephone call applications. Our proposed system supports multiple languages and eliminates the need for large-scale annotated data during training by utilizing the multilingual Whisper model to extract speaker embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a network architecture called Mixture of Sparse Autoencoders (Mix-SAE) for unsupervised speaker clustering. Experimental results on the evaluation dataset derived from two-speaker subsets of benchmark CALLHOME and CALLFRIEND telephonic speech corpora demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed Mix-SAE network to other autoencoder-based clustering methods. The overall performance of our proposed system also highlights the promising potential for developing unsupervised, multilingual speaker diarization systems within the context of limited annotated data. It also indicates the system's capability for integration into multi-task speech analysis applications based on general-purpose models such as those that combine speech-to-text, language detection, and speaker diarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing prominence of the field of audio deepfake detection is driven by its wide range of applications, notably in protecting the public from potential fraud and other malicious activities, prompting the need for greater attention and research in this area. The ADD 2023 challenge goes beyond binary real/fake classification by emulating real-world scenarios, such as the identification of manipulated intervals in partially fake audio and determining the source responsible for generating any fake audio, both with real-life implications, notably in audio forensics, law enforcement, and construction of reliable and trustworthy evidence. To further foster research in this area, in this article, we describe the dataset that was used in the fake game, manipulation region location and deepfake algorithm recognition tracks of the challenge. We also focus on the analysis of the technical methodologies by the top-performing participants in each task and note the commonalities and differences in their approaches. Finally, we discuss the current technical limitations as identified through the technical analysis, and provide a roadmap for future research directions. The dataset is available for download at http://addchallenge.cn/downloadADD2023.</description>
