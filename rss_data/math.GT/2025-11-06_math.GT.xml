      <title>The pretzel knot $P(4, -3, 5)$ is not squeezed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that an infinite family of three-strand pretzel knots is not squeezed. In particular, we show that $P(4, -3, 5)$ is not squeezed. This answers a question posed by Lewark (2024). Our proof is obtained by comparing the Rasmussen invariant with the $q_M$-invariant introduced by Iida and Taniguchi.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic invariants of torus links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical analogy between knots and primes motivates the study of Alexander polynomials through an arithmetic perspective. In this article we study the two-parameter family of torus knots and links $T_{p,q}$ and analyze the asymptotic behaviour of the zeros of their Alexander polynomials $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$, defined with respect to the total linking number covering. We prove that as $p,q\to\infty$ these zeros become equidistributed on the unit circle and derive an explicit formula for the limiting frequency with which primitive $r$-th roots of unity appear. To capture finer statistical information, we introduce the moment sequence of the zero distribution and compute its generating function in closed form. We further examine the Iwasawa theory of the corresponding branched covers, determining the Iwasawa invariants. The logarithmic Mahler measure of $\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ vanishes identically and the associated homological growth in towers of abelian covers of $S^3$ branched along $T_{p,q}$ is subexponential.</description>

      <title>Median geometry for spaces with measured walls and for groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:1708.00254v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that uniform lattices of isometries of products of real hyperbolic spaces act properly discontinuously and cocompactly on a median space. For lattices in products of at least two factors, this is the strongest degree of compatibility possible with the median geometry. Our theorem is also relevant for potential Rips-type theorems for median spaces. The result follows from an analysis of a quasification of median geometry that provides a geometric characterization of spaces at finite Hausdorff distance from a median space. We explain how the case of complex hyperbolic metric spaces is different, and that such spaces cannot be at finite Hausdorff distance from a median space.</description>

      <title>Bounds for the number of moves between pants decompositions, and between triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two pants decompositions of a compact orientable surface $S$, we give an upper bound for their distance in the pants graph that depends logarithmically on their intersection number and polynomially on the Euler characteristic of $S$. As a consequence, we find an upper bound on the volume of the convex core of a maximal cusp (which is a hyperbolic structures on $S \times \mathbb{R}$ where given pants decompositions of the conformal boundary are pinched to annular cusps). As a further application, we give an upper bound for the Weil--Petersson distance between two points in the Teichm\"uller space of $S$ in terms of their corresponding short pants decompositions. Similarly, given two one-vertex triangulations of $S$, we give an upper bound for the number of flips and twist maps needed to convert one triangulation into the other. The proofs rely on using pre-triangulations, train tracks, and an algorithm of Agol, Hass, and Thurston.</description>

      <title>A note on the unknotting number and the region unknotting number of weaving knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A weaving knot is an alternating knot whose minimal diagram is a closed braid of a lattice-like pattern. In this paper, the warping degree of a braid diagram is defined, and upper bounds of the unknotting number and the region unknotting number for some families of weaving knots are given by diagrammatical and combinatorial examination of the warping degree of weaving knot diagrams.</description>

      <title>Effective bounds on characterising slopes for all knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A slope $p/q$ is characterising for a knot $K \subset \mathbb{S}^3$ if the orientation-preserving homeomorphism type of the manifold $\mathbb{S}^3_K(p/q)$ obtained by performing Dehn surgery of slope $p/q$ along $K$ uniquely determines the knot $K$. We combine new applications of results from hyperbolic geometry with previous individual work of the authors to determine, for any given knot $K$, an explicit bound $\mathcal{C}(K)$ such that $|q| &gt; \mathcal{C}(K)$ implies that $p/q$ is a characterising slope for $K$. Furthermore, we find an optimal such $\mathcal{C}(K)$ for certain satellite knots with winding number zero patterns.</description>

      <title>Twisted torus knots with Horadam parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17850v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sangyop Lee has done much work to determine the knot types of twisted torus knots, including classifying the twisted torus knots which are the unknot. Among the unknotted twisted torus knots are those of the form $K(F_{n+2}, F_n, F_{n+1}, -1)$, where $F_i$ is the $i$th Fibonacci number. Here, we consider twisted torus knots with parameters that are defined recursively, similarly to the Fibonacci sequence. We call these Horadam parameters, after the generalization of the Fibonacci sequence introduced by A.F. Horadam. Here, we provide families of twisted torus knots that generalize Lee's work with Horadam parameters. Additionally, we provide lists of primitive/primitive and primitive/Seifert twisted torus knots and connect these lists to the Horadam twisted torus knots.</description>

      <title>Positive scalar curvature with point singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20163v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that in every dimension $n \geq 8$, there exists a smooth closed manifold $M^n$ which does not admit a smooth positive scalar curvature ("psc") metric, but $M$ admits an $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-metric which is smooth and has psc outside a singular set of codimension $\geq 8$. This provides counterexamples to a conjecture of Schoen. In fact, there are such examples of arbitrarily high dimension with only single point singularities. We also discuss related phenomena on exotic spheres and tori. In addition, we provide examples of $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-metrics on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for certain $n \geq 8$ which are smooth and have psc outside the origin, but cannot be smoothly approximated away from the origin by everywhere smooth Riemannian metrics of non-negative scalar curvature. This stands in precise contrast to established smoothing results via Ricci-DeTurck flow for singular metrics with stronger regularity assumptions. Finally, as a positive result, we describe a $\mathrm{KO}$-theoretic condition which obstructs the existence of $\mathrm{L}^\infty$-metrics that are smooth and of psc outside a finite subset. This shows that closed enlargeable spin manifolds do not carry such metrics.</description>
