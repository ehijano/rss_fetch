      <title>Novel nonlinear system family generated from coupling effect of Sin-Cosine function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sine-Cosine function, which is widely adopted in mathematics and physics, has attracted our attention due to its unique properties. By delving into the coupling effect of the Sine-Cosine function, we discover a previously unreported class of nonlinear systems, namely the Sine-Cosine Nonlinear System Family (SCNSF). This discovery is motivated by the need to expand the repertoire of nonlinear systems and understand the complex behaviors that can emerge from the combination of basic trigonometric functions. The SCNSF has both chaotic characteristics in the real number domain and fractal characteristics in the complex number domain. The classification and general mathematical description of SCNSF provide a solid theoretical foundation for further research. The proposal of three types of classic systems within SCNSF and the investigation of their chaotic properties and hardware implementation open up new avenues for practical applications. The large chaotic range exhibited by these systems implies their potential applications in various fields such as secure communication and chaotic circuit design. Moreover, the discovery of the chaos generation mechanism based on the coupling effect of the Sine-Cosine function deepens our understanding of the origin of chaos. In the complex number domain, the high parameter sensitivity and rich fractal patterns of SCNSF can be can be harnessed to develop more advanced encryption algorithms and more sensitive signal detection methods, thereby contributing to the advancement of information security and signal processing technologies. Overall, the chaotic and fractal properties of SCNSF make it a valuable asset in the pursuit of innovative solutions in multiple scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>When a periodic forcing and a time-delayed nonlinear forcing drive a non-delayed Duffing oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When two systems are coupled, the driver system can function as an external forcing over the driven or response system. Also, an external forcing can independently perturb the driven system, leading us to examine the interplay between the dynamics induced by the driver system and the external forcing acting on the response system. The cooperation of the two external perturbations can induce different kinds of behavior and initiate a resonance phenomenon. Here, we analyze and characterize this resonance phenomenon. Moreover, this resonance may coexist in the parameter set and coincide with other resonances typical of coupled systems, as {\it the transmitted resonance} and {\it the coupling-induced resonance}. Thus, we analyze the outcomes to discern their distinctions and understand when the increase in oscillation amplitudes is attributable to one phenomenon, to one of both the others, or a combination of the three.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of multiple limit cycles created in boundary equilibrium bifurcations in hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A boundary equilibrium bifurcation (BEB) in a hybrid dynamical system occurs when a regular equilibrium collides with a switching surface in phase space. This causes a transition to a pseudo-equilibrium embedded within the switching surface, but limit cycles (LCs) and other invariant sets can also be created and the nature of these is not well understood for systems with more than two dimensions. This work treats two codimension-two scenarios in hybrid systems of any number of dimensions, where the number of small-amplitude limit cycles bifurcating from a BEB changes. The first scenario involves a limit cycle (LC) with a Floquet multiplier $1$ and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a pair of limit cycles. The second scenario involves a limit cycle with a Floquet multiplier $-1$ and for nearby parameter values the BEB creates a period-doubled solution. Both scenarios are unfolded in a general setting, showing that typical two-parameter bifurcation diagrams have a curve of saddle-node or period-doubling bifurcations emanating transversally from a curve of BEBs at the codimension-two point. The results are illustrated with three-dimensional examples and an eight-dimensional airfoil model. Detailed computational results show excellent agreement to the unfolding theory and reveal further interesting dynamical features that remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of vorticity moments in shell models of turbulence: A comparison with the Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shell models allow much greater scale separations than those presently achievable with direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, they are an invaluable tool for testing new concepts and ideas in the theory of fully developed turbulence. They also successfully display energy cascades and intermittency in homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flows. Moreover, they are also of great interest to mathematical analysts because, while retaining some of the key features of the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations, they are much more tractable. A comparison of the mathematical properties of shell models and of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations is therefore essential in understanding the correspondence between the two systems. Here we focus on the temporal evolution of the moments, or $L^{2m}$-norms, of the vorticity. Specifically, differential inequalities for the moments of the vorticity in shell models are derived. The contribution of the nonlinear term turns out to be much weaker than its equivalent for the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. Consequently, pointwise-in-time estimates are shown to exist for the vorticity moments for shell models of any order. This result is also recovered via a high-low frequency slaving argument that highlights the scaling relations between vorticity moments of different orders. Finally, it is shown that the estimates for shell models formally correspond to those for the Navier-Stokes equations 'on a point'.</description>

      <title>Isochronous and period-doubling diagrams for symplectic maps of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symplectic mappings of the plane serve as key models for exploring the fundamental nature of complex behavior in nonlinear systems. Central to this exploration is the effective visualization of stability regimes, which enables the interpretation of how systems evolve under varying conditions. While the area-preserving quadratic H\'enon map has received significant theoretical attention, a comprehensive description of its mixed parameter-space dynamics remain lacking. This limitation arises from early attempts to reduce the full two-dimensional phase space to a one-dimensional projection, a simplification that resulted in the loss of important dynamical features. Consequently, there is a clear need for a more thorough understanding of the underlying qualitative aspects.
  This paper aims to address this gap by revisiting the foundational concepts of reversibility and associated symmetries, first explored in the early works of G.D. Birkhoff. We extend the original framework proposed by H\'enon by adding a period-doubling diagram to his isochronous diagram, which allows to represents the system's bifurcations and the groups of symmetric periodic orbits that emerge in typical bifurcations of the fixed point. A qualitative and quantitative explanation of the main features of the region of parameters with bounded motion is provided, along with the application of this technique to other symplectic mappings, including cases of multiple reversibility. Modern chaos indicators, such as the Reversibility Error Method and the Generalized Alignment Index, are employed to distinguish between various dynamical regimes in the mixed space of variables and parameters. These tools prove effective in differentiating regular and chaotic dynamics, as well as in identifying twistless orbits and their associated bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for membrane lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>
