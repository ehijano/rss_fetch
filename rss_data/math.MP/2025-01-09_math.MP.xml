      <title>Pairs of Subspaces, Split Quaternions and the Modular Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the work of Rieffel and van Daele on pairs of subspaces of a real Hilbert space, while relaxing as much as possible the assumption that all the relevant subspaces are in general positions with respect to each other. We work out, in detail, how two real projection operators lead to the construction of a complex Hilbert space where the theory of the modular operator is applicable, with emphasis on the relevance of a central extension of the group of split quaternions. Two examples are given for which the subspaces have unequal dimension and therefore are not in generic position.</description>

      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bi-frequency solitary waves are generically present in fermionic systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system and the Soler model. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available. We conjecture that stable bi-frequency modes serve as storages of the Dark Matter.</description>

      <title>Galaxy dynamics, gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system, Landau damping, and scattering theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system linearized around steady states that are extensively used in galaxy dynamics. Namely, polytropes and King steady states. We develop a complete stationary scattering theory for the selfadjoint, strictly positive, Antonov operator that governs the plane-symmetric linearized dynamics. We identify the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Antonov operator. Namely, we prove that the absolutely continuous spectrum of the Antonov operator coincides with its essential spectrum and with the spectrum of the unperturbed Antonov operator. Moreover, we prove that the part of the singular spectrum of the Antonov operator that is embedded in its absolutely continuous spectrum is contained in a closed set of measure zero, that we characterize. We construct the generalized Fourier maps and we prove that they are partially isometric with initial subspace the absolutely continuous subspace of the Antonov operator and that they are onto the Hilbert space where the Antonov operator is defined. Furthermore, we prove that the wave operators exist, are isometric, and are complete. Moreover, we obtain stationary formulae for the wave operators and we prove that Birman's invariance principle holds.Further, we prove that the gravitational Landau damping holds for the solutions to the linearized gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system with initial data in the absolutely continuous subspace of the Antonov operator. Namely, we prove that the gravitational force and its time derivative, as well as the gravitational potential and its time derivative, tend to zero as time tends to $\pm \infty.$ Furthermore, for these initial states the solutions to the linearized gravitational Vlasov-Poisson system are asymptotic, for large times, to the orbits of the gravitational potential of the steady state, in the sense that they are transported along these orbits.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of generic Riemann solutions for Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-asymptotic stability of generic Riemann solution, consisting of a rarefaction wave, a contact discontinuity and a shock, for the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation, has been a long-standing open problem in kinetic theory. In this paper, we proved that the composite waves of generic Riemann profile including the inviscid self-similar rarefaction wave, the viscous contact wave (i.e., the viscous version of contact discontinuity) and the viscous shock profile with the time-dependent shift to both macroscopic and microscopic components are nonlinearly stable for the one-dimensional Boltzmann equation, by the first using the $a$-contraction method to the Boltzmann equation. Compared with the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, the new difficulties here lie in the microscopic effects of the Boltzmann shock profile and their interactions and/or couplings with the rarefaction wave, viscous contact wave and the macroscopic components from the macro-micro decomposition of the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality relation. An orthoset with 0 is an orthoset augmented with an additional element 0, called falsity, which is orthogonal to every element. The collection of subspaces of a Hilbert space that are spanned by a single vector provides a motivating example.
  We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \colon Y \to X$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp y$ if and only if $x \perp g(y)$. We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We discuss in this paper adjointability from several perspectives and we put a particular focus on maps preserving the orthogonality relation.
  We moreover investigate the category OS of all orthosets with 0 and adjointable maps between them. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthosets with 0. iOS can be made into a dagger category, the dagger of a morphism being its unique adjoint. iOS contains dagger subcategories of various sorts and provides in particular a framework for the investigation of projective Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Reduction by stages for affine W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pair of nilpotent orbits in a simple Lie algebra, one can associate a pair of vertex algebras called affine W-algebras. Under some compatibility conditions on these orbits, we prove that one of these W-algebras can be obtained as the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the other. This property is called reduction by stages. We provide several examples in classical and exceptional types.
  To prove reduction by stages for affine W-algebras, we use our previous work on reduction by stages for the Slodowy slices associated with these nilpotent orbits, these slices being the associated varieties of the W-algebras. We also prove and use the fact that each W-algebra can be defined using several equivalent BRST cohomology constructions: choosing the right BRST complexes allows us to connect the two W-algebras in a natural way.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the Relative Entropy and the Two-sided Bogoliubov Inequality in von Neumann Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This text studies, on the one hand, certain monotonicity properties of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy and, on the other hand, unbounded perturbation theory of KMS-states which facilitates a proof of the two-sided Bogoliubov inequality in general von Neumann algebras. After introducing the necessary background from the theory of operator algebras and Tomita-Takesaki modular theory, the relative entropy functional is defined and its basic properties are studied. In particular, a full and detailed proof of Uhlmann's important monotonicity theorem for the relative entropy is provided. This theorem will then be used to derive a number of monotonicity inequalities for the relative entropy of normal functionals induced by vectors of the form $V \varOmega, V \varPhi \in \mathcal{H}$, where $V \in \mathscr{B}(\mathcal{H})$ is a suitable transformation. After that, an introduction to perturbation theory in von Neumann algebras is given, with an emphasis on unbounded perturbations of KMS-states following the framework of Derezi\'{n}ski-Jak\v{s}i\'{c}-Pillet. This mathematical apparatus will then be used to extend the two-sided Bogoliubov inequality for the relative free energy, which was very recently proved for quantum-mechanical systems, to arbitrary von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>Stability of stationary states for mean field models with multichromatic interaction potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider weakly interacting diffusions on the torus, for multichromatic interaction potentials. We consider interaction potentials that are not H-stable, leading to phase transitions in the mean field limit. We show that the mean field dynamics can exhibit multipeak stationary states, where the number of peaks is related to the number of nonzero Fourier modes of the interaction. We also consider the effect of a confining potential on the structure of non-uniform steady states. We approach the problem by means of analysis, perturbation theory and numerical simulations for the interacting particle systems and the PDEs.</description>

      <title>Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples &amp; Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.04133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the macroscopic behavior of asymmetric attractive zero-range processes on $\mathbb{Z}$ where particles are destroyed at the origin at a rate of order $N^\beta$, where $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ and $N\in\mathbb{N}$ is the scaling parameter. We prove that the hydrodynamic limit of this particle system is described by the unique entropy solution of a hyperbolic conservation law, supplemented by a boundary condition depending on the range of $\beta$. Namely, if $\beta \geqslant 0$, then the boundary condition prescribes the particle current through the origin, whereas if $\beta&lt;0$, the destruction of particles at the origin has no macroscopic effect on the system and no boundary condition is imposed at the hydrodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Carpi-Kawahigashi-Longo-Weiner correspondence between vertex operator algebras and conformal nets to the case of vertex operator superalgebras and graded-local conformal nets by introducing the notion of strongly graded-local vertex operator superalgebra. Then we apply our machinery to a number of well-known examples including superconformal field theory models. We also prove that all lattice VOSAs are strongly graded-local. Furthermore, we prove strong graded-locality of the super-Moonshine VOSA, whose group of automorphisms preserving the superconformal structure is isomorphic to Conway's largest sporadic simple group, and of the shorter Moonshine VOSA, whose automorphisms group is isomorphic to the direct product of the baby Monster with a cyclic group of order two.</description>

      <title>Geometric approach for the identification of Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some new Hamiltonian systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type are presented and the analogue of Okamoto's space of initial conditions computed. Using the geometric approach that was introduced originally for the identification problem of Painlev\'e equations, comparing the irreducible components of the inaccessible divisors arising in the blow-up process, we find bi-rational coordinate changes between some of these systems that give rise to the same global Hamiltonian structure. This scheme thus gives a method for identifying Hamiltonian systems up to bi-rational maps, which is performed in this article for systems of quasi-Painlev\'e type having singularities that are either square-root type algebraic poles or ordinary poles.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of building non-invertible quantum symmetries (as characterized by actions of unitary fusion categories) on noncommutative tori. We introduce a general method to construct actions of fusion categories on inductive limit C*-algberas using finite dimenionsal data, and then apply it to obtain AT-actions of arbitrary Haagerup-Izumi categories on noncommutative 2-tori, of the even part of the $E_{8}$ subfactor on a noncommutative 3-torus, and of $\text{PSU}(2)_{15}$ on a noncommutative 4-torus.</description>

      <title>Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.</description>

      <title>Operational meaning of the classical fidelity and the path length in Fisher-Kubo-Mori-Bogoliubov geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the minimum entropy production in near-reversible quantum state transport along a path is simple function of the path length measured according to the Fisher-KMB metrics. Hence the sharp values of path lengths, also called statistical lengths, obtain operational meaning to quantify the residual irreversibility in near-reversible state transport. In the classical limit, the Bhattacharyya fidelity obtains a sharp operational meaning after eighty years.</description>

      <title>Left-Right Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of \textit{left-right relative entropy} as a measure of distinguishability within the space of boundary states. We compute the left-right relative entropy for reduced density matrices by tracing over either the right- or left-moving modes, deriving a universal formula for two arbitrary, regularized boundary states in conformal field theories (CFTs) on a circle. Furthermore, we provide a detailed expression of the left-right relative entropy for diagonal CFTs with specific boundary state choices, utilizing the theory's modular $\mathcal{S}$ matrix. We also present a general formula for the left-right sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and the left-right quantum fidelity. Through explicit calculations in specific models, including the Ising model, the tricritical Ising model, and the $\widehat{su}(2)_{\tilde{k}}$ WZW model, we have made an intriguing finding: zero left-right relative entropy between certain boundary states, despite their apparent differences. Notably, we introduce the concept of the \textit{relative entanglement sector}, representing the set of boundary states with zero left-right relative entropy. Our findings suggest a profound connection between the relative entanglement sector and the underlying symmetry properties of the boundary states, offering the relative entanglement sector transforms as NIM-reps of a global symmetry of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions and reductions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, Schr\"odinger equations with cubic and more complex nonlinearities containing the unknown function with constant delay are analyzed. The physical considerations that can lead to the appearance of a delay in such nonlinear equations and mathematical models are expressed. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the studied partial differential equations with delay to simpler ordinary differential equations and ordinary differential equations with delay. New exact solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation of the general form with delay, which are expressed in quadratures, are found. To construct exact solutions, a combination of methods of generalized separation of variables and the method of functional constraints are used. Special attention is paid to three equations with cubic nonlinearity, which allow simple solutions in elementary functions, as well as more complex exact solutions with generalized separation of variables. Solutions representing a nonlinear superposition of two traveling waves, the amplitude of which varies periodically in time and space, are constructed. Some more complex nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of a general form with variable delay are also studied. The results of this work can be useful for the development and improvement of mathematical models described by nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with delay and related functional PDEs, and the obtained exact solutions can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics with delay.</description>

      <title>Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates and Higher Order Trotter Product Formulas in Jordan-Banach Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</description>
