      <title>Modular assurance of an Autonomous Ferry using Contract-Based Design and Simulation-based Verification Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the introduction of autonomous technology into our society, e.g. autonomous shipping, it is important to assess and assure the safety of autonomous systems in a real-world context. Simulation-based testing is a common approach to attempt to verify performance of autonomous systems, but assurance also requires formal evidence. This paper introduces the Assurance of Digital Assets (ADA) framework, a structured method for the assurance of digital assets, i.e. novel, complex, or intelligent systems enabled by digital technologies, using contract-based design. Results are shown for an autonomous ferry assurance case, focusing on collision avoidance during the ferry's transit. Further, we discuss the role of simulation-based testing in verifying compliance to contract specifications, to build the necessary evidence for an assurance case.</description>

      <title>Flexible Type-Based Resource Estimation in Quantum Circuit Description Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a type system for the Quipper language designed to derive upper bounds on the size of the circuits produced by the typed program. This size can be measured according to various metrics, including width, depth and gate count, but also variations thereof obtained by considering only some wire types or some gate kinds. The key ingredients for achieving this level of flexibility are effects and refinement types, both relying on indices, that is, generic arithmetic expressions whose operators are interpreted differently depending on the target metric. The approach is shown to be correct through logical predicates, under reasonable assumptions about the chosen resource metric. This approach is empirically evaluated through the QuRA tool, showing that, in many cases, inferring tight bounds is possible in a fully automatic way.</description>

      <title>Preservation theorems for Tarski's relation algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04656v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a number of semantically defined fragments of Tarski's algebra of binary relations, including the function-preserving fragment. We address the question whether they are generated by a finite set of operations. We obtain several positive and negative results along these lines. Specifically, the homomorphism-safe fragment is finitely generated (both over finite and over arbitrary structures). The function-preserving fragment is not finitely generated (and, in fact, not expressible by any finite set of guarded second-order definable function-preserving operations). Similarly, the total-function-preserving fragment is not finitely generated (and, in fact, not expressible by any finite set of guarded second-order definable total-function-preserving operations). In contrast, the forward-looking function-preserving fragment is finitely generated by composition, intersection, antidomain, and preferential union. Similarly, the forward-and-backward-looking injective-function-preserving fragment is finitely generated by composition, intersection, antidomain, inverse, and an `injective union' operation.</description>

      <title>Complexity results for modal logic with recursion via translations and tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16881v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of classical modal logics and of their extension with fixed-point operators, using translations to transfer results across logics. In particular, we show several complexity results for multi-agent logics via translations to and from the $\mu$-calculus and modal logic, which allow us to transfer known upper and lower bounds. We also use these translations to introduce terminating and non-terminating tableau systems for the logics we study, based on Kozen's tableau for the $\mu$-calculus and the one of Fitting and Massacci for modal logic. Finally, we describe these tableaux with $\mu$-calculus formulas, thus reducing the satisfiability of each of these logics to the satisfiability of the $\mu$-calculus, resulting in a general 2EXP upper bound for satisfiability testing.</description>

      <title>LOGIC-LM++: Multi-Step Refinement for Symbolic Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02514v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning tasks. Although recent works have started to employ formal languages as an intermediate representation for reasoning tasks, they often face challenges in accurately generating and refining these formal specifications to ensure correctness. To address these issues, this paper proposes Logic-LM++, an improvement on Logic-LM . It uses the ability of LLMs to do pairwise comparisons, allowing the evaluation of the refinements suggested by the LLM. The paper demonstrates that Logic-LM++ outperforms Logic-LM and other contemporary techniques across natural language reasoning tasks on three datasets, FOLIO, ProofWriter and AR-LSAT, with an average improvement of 18.5% on standard prompting, 12.3% on chain of thought prompting and 5% on Logic-LM.</description>

      <title>Persistent homology of partially ordered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore links between natural homology and persistent homology for the classification of directed spaces. The former is an algebraic invariant of directed spaces, a semantic model of concurrent programs. The latter was developed in the context of topological data analysis, in which topological properties of point-cloud data sets are extracted while eliminating noise. In both approaches, the evolution homological properties are tracked through a sequence of inclusions of usual topological spaces. Exploiting this similarity, we show that natural homology may be considered a persistence object, and may be calculated as a colimit of uni-dimensional persistent homologies along traces. Finally, we suggest further links and avenues of future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Robustness Assessment of a Runway Object Classifier for Safe Aircraft Taxiing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00035v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming the prominent solution for many computational problems, the aviation industry seeks to explore their potential in alleviating pilot workload and in improving operational safety. However, the use of DNNs in this type of safety-critical applications requires a thorough certification process. This need can be addressed through formal verification, which provides rigorous assurances -- e.g.,~by proving the absence of certain mispredictions. In this case-study paper, we demonstrate this process using an image-classifier DNN currently under development at Airbus and intended for use during the aircraft taxiing phase. We use formal methods to assess this DNN's robustness to three common image perturbation types: noise, brightness and contrast, and some of their combinations. This process entails multiple invocations of the underlying verifier, which might be computationally expensive; and we therefore propose a method that leverages the monotonicity of these robustness properties, as well as the results of past verification queries, in order to reduce the overall number of verification queries required by nearly 60%. Our results provide an indication of the level of robustness achieved by the DNN classifier under study, and indicate that it is considerably more vulnerable to noise than to brightness or contrast perturbations.</description>
