      <title>Characterizing Spin-Orbit Torques by Tensorial Spin Hall Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance (MR) provides a crucial tool for experimentally studying spin torques. While MR is well established in the device geometry of the spin Hall effect (SHE), as exemplified by the magnet/heavy-metal heterostructures, its role and manifestation beyond the SHE paradigm remain elusive. Here we propose a previously unknown form of MR where the underlying charge-to-spin conversion and its inverse process violate the simple geometry of the SHE, calling for tensorial descriptions. This novel MR can generate a series of unique harmonic responses essential for the experimental characterization of unconventional spin-orbit torques in non-SHE materials. Our results are demonstrated in semimetal WTe$_2$ thin films.</description>

      <title>Band engineering aided by topological edge state proximity effects: Inducing anti-chirality in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we analyze infinite graphene nanoribbons subjected to non-uniform magnetic fields that produce topological domain walls in the quantum Hall regime. We show how the proximity between edge states from neighboring domains modifies the band structure due to the state coupling near the domain walls. The proximity-induced band deformations produce phenomena such as bulk-like dispersion that coexist with Landau levels and valley-polarized current paths. It is shown that edge state coupling can be enhanced by continuously varying the magnetic field between two non-trivial topological phases. The mechanism by which neighboring edge states modify the band structure is addressed by tracking their wave-functions over isolated bands and by analyzing the magnetic confinement potential near the domain wall. By calculating the local current density, we show that the coexistence of topological edge states with bulk-like dispersion can lead to the appearance of anti-chirality, in which co-propagating currents appear in the edges while the rest of the nanoribbon is occupied with bulk states. The appearance of anti-chirality is justified by comparing the proposed non-uniform magnetic field profile with an anti-chiral modified Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Shift current in 2D Janus Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides: the role of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the shift current in two two-dimensional (2D) Janus transition metal dichalcogenides: molybdenum diselenide (MoSSe) and tungsten diselenide (WSSe). The shift current is evaluated using a real-time approach, in which the coupling with an external field is described in terms of a dynamical Berry phase. This approach incorporates electron-hole interactions and quasiparticle band structure renormalization through an effective Hamiltonian derived from many-body perturbation theory. We find that the shift current is strongly enhanced in correspondence of C excitons. An analysis in terms of the electron-hole pairs reveals that electron and hole are localized on different atoms, and thus following an optical excitation, the center of the electron charge is shifted thus giving rise to a significant photocurrent. These results highlight the role played by excitons in the shift-current response of Janus TMDs and demonstrate that these materials are promising building blocks for future photovoltaic devices.</description>

      <title>Finite Thickness Effects on Metallization Vs. Chiral Majorana Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heterostructures composed of quantum anomalous Hall insulators and \textit{s}-wave superconductors (SCs), metallization hinders the identification of chiral Majorana fermions (CMFs). In this Letter, we study how the thickness of SC affects the competition between metallization and CMFs by a holistic approach previously developed for hybrid nanowire systems [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 266605 (2024)]. We predict three types of structures that vary with thickness of SC: (i) Periodic structure of metallization. For thin SCs ($\sim$10\,nm), the metallization region exhibits oscillations as the thickness of SC changes, with the oscillation period corresponding to the Fermi wavelength of SC. (ii) Periodic structure of CMFs. For intermediate thicknesses ($\sim$100\,nm), the window width for observing CMFs exhibits a periodic behavior, oscillating with the same period. (iii) Stable structure of CMFs. For thick SCs ($\sim$1000\,nm), the behavior of CMFs becomes uniform as the thickness varies. Optimizing the thickness of SC may thus improve data quality and provide clearer evidence for CMFs.</description>

      <title>Coherent Spin Waves in Curved Ferromagnetic Nanocaps of a 3D-printed Magnonic Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent magnon modes in a truly three-dimensional (3D) magnonic crystal have not yet been investigated. This scientific gap exists despite the numerous theoretical predictions about miniband formation and edge modes with topological protection. Such properties are key to advance nanomagnonics for ultrafast data processing. In this work, we use a scalable nanotechnology and integrate a 3D magnonic crystal to an on-chip microresonator. It was fabricated by two-photon lithography of a 3D woodpile structure and atomic layer deposition of 30-nm-thick nickel. Operated near 14 and 24~GHz, the microresonator output revealed numerous coherent magnons with distinct angular dependencies reflecting the underlying face-centred cubic lattice. Micromagnetic simulations show that the edge modes are localised in curved nanocaps and robust against changes in field orientation. Along an edge, they exhibit an unexpected phase evolution. Our findings advance functional microwave circuits with 3D magnonic crystals and fuel their visionary prospects of edge-dominated magnon modes.</description>

      <title>Pseudo anomalous Hall effect in semiconductors and semimetals: A classical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the non-linear field dependence in the Hall effect, often indistinguishable from the anomalous Hall effect, can be realized entirely within the classical mechanism due to the Lorentz force by analyzing multi-valley models for semiconductors and semimetals. The non-linear component in the Hall resistivity $\rho_H^{\rm NL}$ originates from carrier mobility anisotropy or the coexistence of different charges. Since $\rho_H^{\rm NL}$ is inversely proportional to the carrier difference between electrons and holes $\Delta n$, it exceeds its zero-field value near charge neutrality. As a practical example, we show that the magnitude of the classical non-linear Hall response in ZrTe$_5$ is comparable to the experimental values, underscoring the importance of accounting for classical contributions before attributing non-linear Hall effects to quantum mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamical signatures of non-Hermitian boundary modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence features an interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous boundary-mode behavior. Whereas the skin effect is known to manifest itself in quantum dynamics in the form of chiral damping, it has remained less clear what impact the boundary modes may have. Here we derive experimentally accessible signatures of the boundary modes. We also establish clear criteria, based on the effective generalized Brillouin zone, that determine when bulk and boundary effects can be dynamically discerned using the Liouvillian separation gap. This leads to telltale signatures in both stable regimes -- where particle number remains finite -- and in the unstable regimes -- where a macroscopic boundary mode population occurs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the nature of excitons in the 2D magnetic semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitonic effects dominate the optoelectronic properties of van der Waals semiconductors, a characteristic equally true for recently discovered 2D magnetic semiconductors. This brings new possibilities for investigating fundamental interactions between excitons and a correlated spin environment, particularly pronounced in CrSBr. Here, we demonstrate that CrSBr hosts both localised Frenkel-like and delocalised Wannier-Mott-like excitons a duality rare among other magnetic or nonmagnetic 2D materials. Our combined theoretical and experimental high magnetic field studies reveal that these two exciton types exhibit strikingly different responses to magnetic and lattice perturbations. We show that the high-energy exciton (XB) is an order of magnitude more sensitive to magnetic order changes than XA, establishing XB as a highly effective optical probe of the magnetic state. The presented self-consistent many-body perturbation theory provides detailed insight into their electronic and spatial structure, quantitatively explaining the observed differences, based on their relative Wannier-Mott and Frenkel characters. By probing the diamagnetic response in magnetic fields up to 85 T, we estimate the relative spatial extent of the two excitons, with results aligning well with the predictions of our many-body perturbation theory. Furthermore, we observe exceptionally distinct coupling of the two excitons to lattice vibrations: a strong temperature dependent redshift for XB between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, which is almost temperature-invariant for XA. This is attributed to XBs tendency for out-of-plane delocalisation in the FM phase, leading to enhanced coupling with Ag phonon modes. These findings provide a detailed microscopic understanding of both types of excitons and their distinct magneto-exciton coupling.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Time-resolved Magneto-optical Kerr Effect for High-fidelity Magnetic Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spintronics has emerged as a key technology for fast and non-volatile memory with great CMOS compatibility. As the building blocks for these cutting-edge devices, magnetic materials require precise characterization of their critical properties, such as the effective anisotropy field ($H_{\rm{k,eff}}$, related to magnetic stability) and damping ($\alpha$ key factor in device energy efficiency). Accurate measurements of these properties are essential for designing and fabricating high-performance spintronic devices. Among advanced metrology techniques, Time-resolved Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (TR-MOKE) stands out for its superb temporal and spatial resolutions, surpassing traditional methods like ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). However, the full potential of TR-MOKE has not yet been fully pledged due to the lack of systematic optimization and robust operational guidelines. In this study, we address this gap by developing experimentally validated guidelines for optimizing TR-MOKE metrology across materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Our work identifies the optimal ranges of the field angle to simultaneously achieve high signal amplitudes and improve measurement sensitivities to $H_{\rm{k,eff}}$ and $\alpha$. By suppressing the influence of inhomogeneities and boosting sensitivity, our work significantly enhances TR-MOKE capability to extract magnetic properties with high accuracy and reliability. This optimization framework positions TR-MOKE as an indispensable tool for advancing spintronics, paving the way for energy-efficient and high-speed devices that will redefine the landscape of modern computing and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of magnon-polaron bands and thermal Hall conductivity in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-phonon coupling and its efficacy in inducing multiple topological phase transitions in a frustrated kagome antiferromagnet have not been addressed in the literature. To this end, we study the ramifications of invoking optical phonons in a non-collinear antiferromagnet via two different kinds of coupling mechanisms, namely, a local and a non-local one, which are distinct in their macroscopic origin. In the case of a local spin-phonon coupling, a single phonon mode affects the magnetic interactions, whereas in the non-local case, two neighbouring phonon modes are involved in the energy renormalization, and it would be worthwhile to compare and contrast the two. To tackle these phonons, we propose an analytical approach through a canonical spin-Peierls transformation applied to magnons, that renders a hybridization between the magnons and the phonon modes and yields a magnon-polaron quasiparticle state. In both the coupling regimes, the robust support of the topological signatures is derived systematically from the bulk and edge spectral properties of the magnon-polaron bands that are characterized by their corresponding Chern numbers. Thereafter, we witness transitions from one topological phase to another solely via tuning the spin-phonon coupling strength. Moreover, these transitions significantly impact the behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity, which aid in discerning distinct topological phases. Additionally, the explicit dependencies on the temperature and the external magnetic field are explored in inducing topological phase transitions associated with the magnon-polaron bands. Thus, our work serves as an ideal platform to probe the interplay of frustrated magnetism and polaronic physics.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breaking the intrinsic chirality of quasiparticles in graphene enables the emergence of new and intriguing phases. One such paradigmatic example is the bond density wave, which leads to a Kekul\'{e}-ordered structure and underpins exotic electronic states where electron-phonon interactions can play a fundamental role. Here, it is shown that the relevant physics of these correlations can be resolved locally, according to the behavior of interatomic characteristics. For this purpose a robust distance-dependent framework for describing electronic structure of graphene with Kekul\'{e} bond order is presented. Given this insight, the strength of electron-phonon interactions is found to scale linearly with the electronic coupling, contributing to a uniform picture of this relationship in distorted graphene structures. Moreover, it is shown that the introduced distortion yields a strongly non-uniform spatial distribution of the pairing strength that eventually leads to the induction of periodically distributed domains of enhanced electron-phonon coupling. These findings help elucidate certain peculiar aspects of phonon-mediated phenomena in graphene, particularly the associated superconducting phase, and offer potential pathways for their further engineering.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of a Noncollinear Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an effective field theory for a noncollinear altermagnet and magnons on top of the noncollinear ground state from an altermagnetic Heisenberg model. We obtain the ground-state phase diagram, revealing a noncollinear phase and four distinct collinear phases. The ground state of the noncollinear phase fully breaks the spin rotational symmetry, while the ground state of the collinear phases possesses unbroken $\mathrm{SO}(2)$ symmetry. The resulting effective field theory for the noncollinear phase is an $\mathrm{SO}(3)$ sigma model in which the magnonic excitation has three independent degrees of freedom and exhibits the $d$-wave-like anisotropic linear dispersion. We also discuss possible topological solitons, including $\mathbb{Z}_2$ vortices.</description>

      <title>An investigation of the two-dimensional non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This communication presents an examination of a two-dimensional, non-Hermitian Su -Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, which is differentiated from its conventional Hermitian counterpart by incorporating gain and/or loss terms, mathematically represented by imaginary on-site potentials. The time-reversal symmetry is disrupted due to these on-site potentials. Exceptional points in a non-Hermitian system feature eigenvalue coalescence and non-trivial eigenvector degeneracies. Utilization of the rank-nullity theorem and graphical analysis of the phase rigidity factor enable identification of true exceptional points. Furthermore, this investigation achieves vectorized Zak phase quantization and examines a topolectric RLC circuit to derive the corresponding topological boundary resonance condition and the quantum Hall susceptance. Although Chern number quantization is not feasible, staggered hopping amplitudes corresponding to unit-cell lattice sites lead to broken inversion symmetry with non-zero Berry curvature, resulting in finite anomalous Nernst conductivity.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of quantum skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnets have recently emerged as promising candidates for quantum computing, particularly using topologically-protected nanoscale spin textures. While the quantum dynamics of such spin textures has been theoretically studied, direct experimental evidence of their non-classical behavior remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose to employ Brillouin light scattering (BLS) as a method to probe the quantum nature of skyrmions in frustrated magnets. We show that, for a specific geometry, classical skyrmions produce symmetric sidebands in the BLS spectrum, whereas quantum skyrmions exhibit a distinct asymmetry arising from vacuum fluctuations of their rotation. By studying the photon-skyrmion interaction, we calculate the BLS spectrum using a quantum master equation and show that sideband asymmetry serves as a robust witness of energy level quantization. We find that this asymmetry is pronounced at low temperatures, and can be controlled by input laser power. These findings establish a concrete protocol for the optical detection of non-classical features in spin textures, paving the way for exploring their role in quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Winding-Control Mechanism of Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit various interesting and inter-connected spectral, topological, and boundary-sensitive features. By introducing conditional boundary conditions (CBCs) for non-Hermitian quantum systems, we explore a winding-control mechanism that selectively collapses specific periodic boundary condition (PBC) spectra onto their open boundary condition (OBC) counterparts, guided by their specific winding numbers, together with a composite reconstruction of the Brillouin zone (BZ) and generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). The corresponding eigenstates also manifest nontrivial skin effects or extended behaviors arising from the interplay between BZ and GBZ structures. Furthermore, we can generalize our control by incorporating similarity transformations and holomorphic mappings with the boundary controls. We demonstrate the winding control numerically within various models, which enriches our knowledge of non-Hermitian physics across the spectrum, topology, and bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Space Group Symmetry of Chiral Fe-deficient van der Waals Magnet $\text{Fe}_{\text{3-x}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ Probed by Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure symmetry of Fe-deficient $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room temperature has been investigated by a combination of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) and convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED). By symmetry analysis of CBED patterns along different zone axis, the space group of $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ at room-temperature has been identified as $P6_3mc$ (No.186), which derives from the high-symmetry parent system $\text{Fe}_{\text{3}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ ($P6_3/mmc$) by breaking the mirror symmetry along the six-fold rotation axis. The $P3m1$ (No.156) space group previously reported for $\text{Fe}_{\text{2.9}}\text{GeTe}_{\text{2}}$ is a subgroup of $P6_3mc$ suggesting further possible symmetry breaks in this non-stochiometric system.</description>

      <title>Nanosculpted 3D helices of a magnetic Weyl semimetal with switchable nonreciprocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergent properties of materials are defined by the symmetries of their underlying atomic, spin and charge order. The explorations of symmetry breaking effects are therefore usually limited by the intrinsic properties of known, stable materials. In recent years, advances in focused ion beam (FIB) fabrication have enabled the nanostructuring of bulk crystals into ultraprecise transport devices [1-4], facilitating the investigation of geometrical effects on mesoscopic length scales. In this work, we expand such explorations into three-dimensional (3D), curvilinear shapes, by sculpting helical nanostructure devices from single crystals of the high-mobility, centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ [5,6]. The combination of the imposed chiral geometry and intrinsic ferromagnetism yields nonreciprocal electron transport [7-9]. The high coercivity results in an anomalous, reversable diode effect remnant under zero applied magnetic field, which is orders of magnitude larger than can be explained by a classical self-field mechanism. We argue the enhancement originates from the high carrier mobility and the resulting quasi-ballistic transport: the conduction electron mean free path approaches the length scale of the curvature, resulting in increased asymmetrical scattering at the boundaries. We further demonstrate the inverse effect of the nonreciprocal transport: the field-free, current-induced switching of the magnetisation. The results establish the vast potential of 3D nanosculpting to explore and enrich the functionality of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Multistability and Noise-Induced Transitions in Dispersively-Coupled Nonlinear Nanomechanical Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of two coupled bistable modes of a nanomechanical beam. When de-coupled, each driven mode obeys the Duffing equation of motion, with a well-defined bistable region in the frequency domain. When both modes are driven, intermodal dispersive coupling emerges due to the amplitude dependence of the modal frequencies and leads to coupled states of the two modes. We map out the dynamics of the system by sweeping the drive frequencies of both modes in the presence of added noise. The system then samples all accessible states at each combination of frequencies, with the probability of each stable state being proportional to its occupancy time at steady state. In the frequency domain, the system exhibits four stable regions -- one for each coupled state -- which are separated by five curves. These curves are reminiscent of coexistence curves in an equilibrium phase diagram: each curve is defined by robust inter-state transitions, with equal probabilities of finding the system in the two contiguous states. Remarkably, the curves intersect in two triple points, where the system now transitions between three distinct contiguous states. A physical analogy can be made between this nonequilibrium system and a multi-phase thermodynamic system, with possible applications in computing, precision sensing, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum current source on commercial 22-nm CMOS process technology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum effects in nanoscopic devices has in the past mostly been accessible through academic cleanrooms and research foundries. Opening the quantum frontier for wider industrial applications likely requires the scale of well-established complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) foundries for manufacturing transistor-based quantum devices operable above subkelvin temperatures. Here, we operate a commercial 22-nm-node fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) CMOS device as dual parallel-connected charge-pumps for the implementation of a quantum current standard in the International System of Units (SI). We measure the accuracy of (1.2 +/- 0.1)E-3 A/A for this scalable architecture at 50 MHz with reference to SI-traceable voltage and resistance standards in a pumped helium system. Looking ahead we propose a practical monolithic CMOS chip that incorporates one million parallel-connected charge pumps along with on-chip control electronics. This can be operated as a table-top primary standard, generating quantum currents up to microampere levels.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of three-dimensional Kane plasmons in the narrow-bandgap Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on an ultrafast terahertz spectroscopic study on the dynamics of free carriers and the pertinent bulk plasmons in Hg$_{0.8}$Cd$_{0.2}$Te (MCT) film, a narrowband semiconductor accommodating three dimensional massless Kane fermions. The ultrabroadband terahertz source enables the investigation of the lightly doped equilibrium state in the presence of plasmon-phonon hybridization through the heavily doped excited state, primarily dominated by plasmons. Without the recourse to the resource consuming cryogenic high magnetic field spectroscopy that hinges on observable related to the interband transition, we show that the massless band dispersion can instead be conveniently perceived by the room temperature study of the intraband transition through the determination of the plasmon carrier density relationship. We found the plasma frequency in MCT scales with the cube root of carrier density, in contrast with the square root scaling in the conventional massive fermion system of parabolic band dispersion. This work also answers the curious question of whether the MCT can maintain its massless Kane fermion character in case the strict gapless condition is deviated from. The method presented herein provides a convenient approach to identifying the landscape of both massless and massive band dispersion.</description>

      <title>Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 Lateral Heterostructures Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lateral in-plane heterostructures enable precise control of electronic properties and quantum effects in 2D materials. However, their periodic synthesis is challenging because it requires precise control to maintain sharp, coherent interfaces and compatible growth conditions across different domains. Herein, we report the successful heteroepitaxial growth of Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 and periodic lateral heterostructures on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) through in-situ multiple growth steps at different stages using a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system. These trilateral heterostructures are fabricated by growing triangular or hexagonal Bi2Te3 islands at the very beginning, with typical sizes of several hundred nanometers, on the single-crystalline hBN, followed by the lateral growth of Sb2Te3 to form bilateral heterostructures, and finally growing Bi2Te3 on the side facets of the bilateral heterostructures. The electron microscopy results confirm the core area as Bi2Te3, the intermediate layer as Sb2Te3, and the outermost region as Bi2Te3. The resulting heterostructures are approximately 4-8 nm thick and several hundred nanometers in lateral dimensions. These heterostructures are found to grow epitaxially on hBN (&lt; +-4 deg misalignment), and the individual layers are strongly epitaxially aligned with each other. The in-plane heterojunctions are analyzed using the aberration-corrected (Cs-corrected) high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy technique. We have explored and established the plasmonic properties of these fabricated Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3-Bi2Te3 lateral heterostructures. In addition, the electronic states and the topological properties of the few quintuple layers (QLs) (2- to 4-QLs) Bi2Te3-Sb2Te3 lateral periodic heterostructures are investigated by first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of zero-dimensional topological states in ultranarrow germanene nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected zero-dimensional (0D) modes, such as corner and end states with fractionalized charge, promise robust qubits and efficient electronics. Yet, reversible, electric-field manipulation and control of these modes has remained elusive. Here, we show theoretically and experimentally electric-field-driven on/off switching of 0D topological end modes in two- and three-hexagon wide germanene nanoribbons in a vertical tunnel junction set-up. We demonstrate the annihilation and restoration of end states in topological samples, but also the induction of 0D topological modes in initially trivial ribbons. The process is reversible, and the system operates at 77 Kelvin. This atomic-scale platform realizes a proof-of-principle for a 0D topological field-effect device, opening an unexpected path for ultra-small memory, quantum computing, and neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vibrational properties of semiconducting graphene buffer layer epitaxially grown on hexagonal silicon carbide are determined using first-principles calculations on a realistic structural model. Despite the important chemical and structural disorder associated with the partial covalent bonding with the substrate, the buffer-layer carbon atoms still display quasidispersive phonons mimicking those of graphene. The related frequency softening and broadening provide a natural interpretation of the measured Raman signal. The vibrations determining thermal conduction are found to delocalize completely on the SiC substrate, leading to an effective spatial separation between material components determining, respectively, electronic and thermal transport properties. This situation opens perspectives for thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the field of multilevel quantum batteries, we present the model of a quantum device for energy storage with anharmonic level spacing, based on a superconducting circuit in the transmon regime. It is charged via the sequential interaction with a collection of identical and independent ancillary two-level systems. By means of a numerical analysis we show that, in case these ancillas are coherent, this kind of quantum battery can achieve remarkable performances for what it concerns the control of the stored energy and its extraction in regimes of parameters within reach in nowadays quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material CrI3 has aroused extensive attention, because it could provide a new platform for investigating the relations between crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties. Here, we study crystal structures and electronic and magnetic properties of three configurations (Cl-Cl I-I and Cl-I) of Janus bilayer Cl3Cr2I3 with two stacking orders (AB and AA1=3) by using the first principles approach incorporating the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect and the dipole correction. It is found that the spin polarization and the SOC effect can expand the lattice constant and the interlayer distance (ID) of the three configurations. Especially, the ID of the I-I configuration is 1 {\AA} larger than that of the Cl-Cl configuration. The total energy calculation results show that the atomic configuration, the SOC effect and the stacking order play an important role in determining the magnetic ground states of the Janus layers. Our results indicate the atomic configurations of the Janus bilayers are not conducive to the increase of critical temperature. Interestingly, the Cl-I configuration has a vertical dipole moment, and its AFM state has large spin splitting. It is revealed that the non-periodic structure, the symmetry breaking of the average potential and the weak interlayer interaction lead to the vertical dipole moment and the abnormal AFM state that is not the most stable state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used to measure surface topography of solid, soft, and living matter at the nanoscale. Moreover, by mapping forces as a function of distance to the surface, AFM can provide a wealth of information beyond topography, with nanomechanical properties as a prime example. Here we present a method based on photothermal off-resonance tapping (PORT) to increase the speed of such force spectroscopy measurements by at least an order of magnitude, thereby enabling high-throughput, quantitative nanomechanical mapping of a wide range of materials. Specifically, we use photothermal actuation to modulate the position of the AFM probe at frequencies that far exceed those possible with traditional actuation by piezo-driven z scanners. Understanding and accounting for the microscale thermal and mechanical behavior of the AFM probe, we determine the resulting probe position at sufficient accuracy to allow rapid and quantitative nanomechanical examination of polymeric and metallic materials.</description>

Abstract: Bismuth nanoparticles are being investigated due to their reported photothermal and photocatalytic properties. In this study, we synthesised spherical bismuth nanoparticles (50-600 nm) and investigated their structural and optical properties at the single particle level using analytical transmission electron microscopy. Our experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, demonstrate that bismuth nanoparticles support localised surface plasmon resonances, which can be tuned from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet spectral region by changing the nanoparticle size. Furthermore, plasmonic resonances demonstrate stability across the entire spectral bandwidth, enhancing the attractiveness of bismuth nanoparticles for applications over a wide spectral range. Bismuth's lower cost, biocompatibility, and oxidation resistance make it a suitable candidate for utilisation, particularly in industrial and large-scale plasmonic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The plasmonic optical absorption of the silica glasses containing copper selenide nanoparticles is simulated on the basis of Drude theory. The plasmonic resonance absorption is studied in dependence on plasmonic frequency, damping factor and the matrix dielectric function. The charge carrier concentration in the nanoparticles is evaluated through the plasmonic frequency for the spectra of closest correspondence to experimental. The plasmon resonance position and the width of maxima are varied throughout the visible and near-IR ranges for the above parameters of experimental glasses with Cu2-xSe nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Flat Midgap Topological Surface and Hypersurface Bands without Parameter Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model is extended to the three and higher dimensional systems. Nearly or absolutely flat midgap surface and hypersurface bands are predicted based on the topological analysis, which do not require fine tuning of parameters. By adding the on-site Coulomb interaction for the three dimensional systems, we computationally show that the large difference in the band widths between the surface and the bulk leads to the strongly correlated phenomena, specifically magnetism, confined only on the surface. Possible experimental realizations in solid state materials and metamaterials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Line Tension Reshapes Nucleation at Surface Edges: A Generalized Theory for Nanopore Activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation at surface edges is pervasive across nature and industry, yet the role of line tension, arising from asymmetric capillary interactions at geometric singularities, remains poorly understood. Herein we develop a generalized nucleation theory that explicitly incorporates line tension induced by edge pinning, thereby extending classical frameworks to account for nanoscale confinement and interfacial asymmetry. Through analytical treatment of droplet formation within geometrically defined nanopores, we derive a closed-form expression for the edge-pinned line tension as a function of Laplace pressure, pore geometry, and wettability. This formulation reveals that line tension can significantly reshape the nucleation energy landscape, introducing nontrivial dependencies on contact angle and pore morphology. Our results uncover a tunable, geometry-mediated mechanism for controlling nucleation barriers, offering predictive insight into phase transitions in confined environments and suggesting new strategies for design in applications ranging from nanofluidics to crystallization control.</description>

      <title>High-accuracy inference using HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate high accuracy classification for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset ($\sim$98.00$\%$) and RGB images from the CIFAR-10 dataset ($\sim$86.80$\%$) by using resistive memories based on a 2D van-der-Waals semiconductor: hafnium disulfide (HfS$_2$). These memories are fabricated via dry thermal oxidation, forming vertical crossbar HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$ devices with a highly-ordered oxide-semiconductor structure. Our devices operate without electroforming or current compliance and exhibit multi-state, non-volatile resistive switching, allowing resistance to be tuned using voltage pulse trains. Using low-energy potentiation and depression pulses (0.7V-0.995V, 160ns-350ns), we achieve 31 ($\sim$5 bits) stable conductance states with high linearity, symmetry, and low variation over 100 cycles. Key performance metrics-such as weight update, quantisation, and retention-are extracted from these experimental devices. These characteristics are used to simulate neural networks with our resistive memories as weights. Neural networks are trained on state-of-the-art (SOTA) digital hardware (CUDA cores) and a baseline inference accuracy is extracted. IBM's Analog Hardware Acceleration Kit (AIHWKIT) is used to modify and remap digital weights in the pretrained network, based on the characteristics of our devices. Simulations account for factors like conductance linearity, device variation, and converter resolution. In both image recognition tasks, we demonstrate excellent performance, similar to SOTA, with only $&lt;$0.07$\%$ and $&lt;$1.00$\%$ difference in inference accuracy for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets respectively. The forming-free, compliance-free operation, fast switching, low energy consumption, and high accuracy classification demonstrate the potential of HfO$_x$S$_y$/HfS$_2$-based resistive memories for energy-efficient neural network acceleration and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of in-plane magnetic fields to Josephson junctions enables fundamental exploration of quantum phenomena, including Zeeman-driven 0-$\pi$ transitions and planar topological superconductivity. However, intrinsic orbital effects arising from nanoscale rippled geometries in practical devices can dominate phase interference signatures, complicating their interpretation. Here, we experimentally probe superconducting interference in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions under combined perpendicular and in-plane magnetic fields. The critical supercurrent reveals a distinct diamond-shaped interference pattern, with nodes progressively opening and evolving into V-shaped features, reminiscent of suppression-recovery patterns associated with 0-$\pi$ transitions. We theoretically analyze the interplay between orbital effects from rippled geometries and non-uniform supercurrent density distributions, demonstrating that their synergistic interaction could reproduce the experimentally observed interference evolution. Our findings elucidate how geometric imperfections and current inhomogeneity cooperatively reshape phase interference, providing critical insights into orbital-dominated phenomena in Josephson systems.</description>

      <title>Higher vortexability: zero field realization of higher Landau levels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of moir\'{e} materials has led to experimental realizations of integer and fractional Chern insulators in small or vanishing magnetic fields. At the same time, a set of minimal conditions sufficient to guarantee a Abelian fractional state in a flat band were identified, namely "ideal" or "vortexable" quantum geometry. Such vortexable bands share essential features with the lowest Landau level, while excluding the need for more fine-tuned aspects such as flat Berry curvature. A natural and important generalization is to ask if such conditions can be extended to capture the quantum geometry of higher Landau levels, particularly the first (1LL), where non-Abelian states at $\nu = 1/2,2/5$ are known to be competitive. The possibility of realizing these states at zero magnetic field , and perhaps even more exotic ones, could become a reality if we could identify the essential structure of the 1LL in Chern bands. In this work, we introduce a precise definition of 1LL quantum geometry, along with a figure of merit that measures how closely a given band approaches the 1LL. We apply the definition to identify two models with 1LL structure -- a toy model of double bilayer twisted graphene and a more realistic model of strained Bernal graphene.</description>

      <title>Transport signatures of single and multiple Floquet Majorana modes in one-dimensional Rashba nanowire and Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the transport signature of single and multiple Floquet Majorana end modes~(FMEMs), appearing in an experimentally feasible setup with Rashba nanowire~(NW) placed in closed proximity to a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, in the presence of an external Zeeman field. Periodic drive causes the anomalous $\pi$-modes to emerge in addition to the regular $0$-modes in the driven system where the former does not exhibit any static analog. For single $0$- and/or $\pi$-FMEM, differential conductance exhibits a quantized value of $2e^{2}/h$ while we consider the sum over all the photon sectors, supporting Floquet sum rule. We examine the stability of this summed conductance against random onsite disorder. We further investigate the summed conductance in several cases hosting multiple~(more than one) $0$- or $\pi$-modes at the end of the NW. In these cases, we obtain quantized values of $n_{M}\times 2e^{2}/h$ in summed differential conductance with $n_{M}$ being the number of modes~($0$ or $\pi$) localized at one end of the NW. We repeat our analysis for another experimentally realizable model system known as helical Shiba chain. Moreover, we corroborate our results by computing the differential conductance for FMEMs using non-equilibrium Green's function method. Our work opens up the possibility of studying the transport signatures of FMEMs in these realistic models.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Lifshitz force with graphene: theory versus experiment, role of spatial non-locality and of losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of spatial non-locality and losses in the electromagnetic response of graphene on the Casimir-Lifshitz interaction. To this purpose, we calculate the Casimir-Lifshitz force (CLF) between a gold sphere and a graphene-coated SiO$_2$ plane and compare our finding with the recent experiment in PRL {\bf 126}, 206802 (2021) and PRB {\bf 104}, 085436 (2021). We calculated the CLF using three different models for the electromagnetic response of graphene: electric conductivity using a non-local and lossy Kubo model, electric conductivity using the local and lossy Kubo model, and the non-local and lossless polarization operator model. The relation between these three models has been recently explored in PRB {\bf 111}, 115428 (2025). We show that, for the parameters of the available experiments, the theoretical predictions for the Casimir-Lifshitz force using the three models are practically identical (having a relative differences smaller than $10^{-3}$). This implies that for those given experiments, both non-local and lossy effects in the graphene response are completely negligible. We also find that this experiment cannot distinguish between the Drude and Plasma prescriptions for the involved materials (gold and graphene). Our findings are relevant for present and future comparisons with experimental measurement of the Casimir-Lifshitz force involving graphene structures. Indeed, we show that an extremely simple local Kubo model for the electric conductivity, explicitly depending on Dirac mass, chemical potential, losses and temperature, is largely enough for a totally comprehensive comparison with typical experimental configurations. We also show how the Polarization tensor must be used and modified in general, for phenomena needing a more fine response function, i.e. requiring both the spatial non-locality and losses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a class of systems, there are gapped boundary-localized states described by a boundary Hamiltonian. The topological classification of gapped boundary Hamiltonians, same as the standard tenfold way for gapped bulk states, can lead to the emergence of boundary topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (TSCs). In this work, we present a theoretical study of boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes. Based on the boundary projection analyses for a $d$-dimensional Dirac continuum model, we demonstrate that nontrivial boundary topology can arise at a $(d-n)$-dimensional boundary if the Dirac model incorporates ($n+1$) mass terms with $0&lt;n&lt;d$ although its bulk and $(d-1)$D, $\cdots$, $(d-n+1)$D boundaries are topologically trivial. Furthermore, we present a unified criterion for the emergence of nontrivial boundary topology by extending bulk classification within the context of the Dirac model, which provides a unified framework for nontrivial bulk and boundary topology. Inspired by the Dirac continuum model analysis, we further construct bulk lattice Hamiltonians for realizing boundary TIs and TSCs of the full Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold symmetry classes, which enables the realization of higher-order TIs and TSCs in arbitrary dimensions with arbitrary orders. We analyze some typical examples of the constructed boundary TIs and TSCs in physical dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Impurities in quantum materials have provided successful strategies for learning properties of complex states, ranging from unconventional superconductors to topological insulators. In quantum magnetism, inferring the Hamiltonian of an engineered system becomes a challenging open problem in the presence of complex interactions. Here we show how a supervised machine-learning technique can be used to infer Hamiltonian parameters from atomically engineered quantum magnets by inferring fluctuations of the ground states due to the presence of impurities. We demonstrate our methodology both with a fermionic model with spin-orbit coupling, as well as with many-body spin models with long-range exchange and anisotropic exchange interactions. We show that our approach enables performing Hamiltonian extraction in the presence of significant noise, providing a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning with experimental observables in atomic-scale quantum magnets. Our results establish a strategy to perform Hamiltonian learning by exploiting the impact of impurities in complex quantum many-body states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a microscopic model, we show that the electron-electron interaction of flat bands deviates significantly from the Coulomb interaction. In particular, we find that large-momentum scattering is enhanced at $\theta\lesssim4^\circ$, with a non-monotonic momentum dependence appearing near the magic angle. For $\theta \gtrsim 1.2^\circ$, the enhanced large-momentum scattering can be attributed to the compact Wannier function. On the other hand, for $\theta\lesssim1.2^\circ$, the nonmonotonic momentum dependence of the interaction matrix cannot be explained by a simple Wannier orbital, indicating a nontrivial modification to the el-el interaction. Notably, the range of angles $\theta$ where the large-momentum scattering is enhanced differs from the magic angles at which nearly-flat bands emerge, suggesting that the angle dependence of material properties provides information about the effect of interaction. The results highlight unusual features of the interaction in moir\'e graphene.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases in Fractals: Local Spin Chern Marker in the Sierpinski carpet Kane-Mele-Rashba Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties and local topology of the Kane-Mele-Rashba model on a Sierpinski Carpet (SC) fractal, constructed from a rectangular flake with an underlying honeycomb arrangement and open boundary conditions. When the system parameters correspond to a topologically trivial phase, the energy spectrum is characterized solely by bulk states that are not significantly modified by the system's fractality. For parameters corresponding to the quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phase, in addition to bulk states, the energy spectrum exhibits in-gap topological states that are strongly influenced by the fractal geometry. As the fractal generation increases, the in-gap topological states acquire a staircase profile, which translates into sharp peaks in the density of states. We also show that both the QSHI and the trivial phase exhibit a large gap in the valence-projected spin spectrum, allowing the use of the local spin Chern marker (LSCM) to index the local topology of the system. Fractality does not affect this gap, allowing the application of LSCM to higher fractal generations. Our results explore the LSCM versatility, showing its potential to access local topology in complex geometries such as fractal systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates magneto-rotational coupling as a distinct contribution to magnetoelastic interactions, which can be influenced by magnetic anisotropy. We determine magneto-rotational coupling coefficients that incorporate the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nanoelement (strip) and demonstrate that this type of coupling can be modified through geometric adjustments. Furthermore, we analyze the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field in a ferromagnetic strip embedded in a nonmagnetic substrate. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are considered sources of the magnetoelastic field, and we examine how the strength of the magneto-rotational coupling varies with the direction of the magnetization, and the aspect ratio of the strip cross-section. We analyze the changes of the magneto-rotational contribution to the magnetoelastic field with an increasing thickness-to-width ratio, assuming a fixed magnetization direction corresponding to the strongest magnetoelastic coupling. For Love wave, the contribution of the out-of-plane component increases monotonically, while that of the in-plane component decreases monotonically. In the case of the Rayleigh wave, only the out-of-plane component contributes, and it approaches zero as the cross-section becomes square. These findings enhance the understanding of magneto-rotational coupling in magnonic nanostructures.</description>

      <title>A non-Lorentzian model for strong exciton-plasmon coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a non-Lorentzian analytical model for quantum emitters (QE) resonantly coupled to localized surface plasmons (LSP) in metal-dielectric structures. Using the explicit form of LSP Green function, we derive non-Lorentzian version of semiclassical Maxwell-Bloch equations that describe LSPs directly in terms of metal complex dielectric function rather than via Lorentzian resonances. For a single QE resonantly coupled to an LSP, we obtain an analytical expression for effective optical polarizability of the hybrid system which, in the Lorentzian approximation, recovers the results of the classical coupled oscillators model. We demonstrate that non-Lorentzian effects originating from temporal dispersion of the metal dielectric function affect significantly the optical spectra as the hybrid system transitions to the strong coupling regime. Specifically, in contrast to results of Lorentzian models, the main spectral weight in the system scattering spectra is shifted toward the lower energy polaritonic band, consistent with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin dynamics across N\'eel phase transition in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the N\'eel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the N\'eel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the N\'eel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the N\'eel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.</description>

      <title>Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Solitonic Andreev Spin Qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of superconducting spin qubit, dubbed solitonic Andreev spin qubit (SASQ), that combines features of Andreev spin qubits and geometric spin qubits. The two SASQ states are the degenerate spin orientations of an Andreev bound state trapped in a circular Josephson junction with a Corbino disk geometry, created on a 2DEG. The junction is subjected to a weak magnetic flux that induces a fluxoid mismatch between the inner disk and outer ring superconductors. The fluxoid mismatch produces a cancellation of the induced pairing that traps unconventional spin-degenerate Andreev bound states analogous to Jackiw-Rebbi soliton states. They are localized at a position around the junction that can be controlled by changing the superconducting phase difference. Moving a soliton state with a phase bias induces a holonomic rotation of its spin, by virtue of the spin-orbit coupling in the 2DEG. The holonomic qubit trajectories can densely cover the full Bloch sphere as the soliton state revolves around the junction. Effects of non-holonomic (dynamic) qubit drift are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Retinomorphic Vision in a Nonlinear Photonic Network Laser</title>

Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for hardware that mimics the brain's ability to extract structure from limited data. In the retina, ganglion cells detect features from sparse inputs via lateral inhibition, where neurons antagonistically suppress activity of neighbouring cells. Biological neurons exhibit diverse heterogeneous nonlinear responses, linked to robust learning and strong performance in low-data regimes.
  Here, we introduce a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' photonic system where spatially-competing lasing modes in a network laser act as heterogeneous, inhibitively-coupled neurons - enabling few-shot classification and segmentation. This compact (150 micron) silicon-compatible scheme addresses key challenges in photonic computing: physical nonlinearity and spatial footprint. We report 98.05% and 87.85% accuracy on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST, and 90.12% on BreaKHis cancer diagnosis - outperforming software CNNs including EfficientNet in few-shot and class-imbalanced regimes. We demonstrate combined segmentation and classification on the HAM10k skin lesion dataset, achieving DICE and Jaccard scores of 84.49% and 74.80%. These results establish a new class of nonlinear photonic hardware for versatile, data-efficient neuromorphic computing.</description>

Abstract: We study new superconductor candidates in functionalized MXenes Zr$_2$NS$_2$, Zr$_2$NCl$_2$, and Sc$_2$NCl$_2$ with $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations based on density functional theory for superconductors (SCDFT). The superconducting transition temperature $(T_c)$ at ambient pressure is predicted to reach 9.48 K (Zr$_2$NS$_2$), with potential further improvements under applied strain. We note that the changes in the profiles of superconducting gap $(\Delta)$ and electron-phonon coupling $(\lambda)$ across the Fermi surface may be influenced by their modified electronic bandstructure components.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Correspondence of Non-Hermitian Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-to-complex spectral transitions and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking of eigenstates are central to non-Hermitian physics, yet a comprehensive and universal theory that precisely describes the underlying physical mechanisms for each individual state remains elusive. Here, we resolve the mystery by employing the complex path integral formalism and developing a generalized Gutzwiller trace formula. These methodologies enable us to establish a universal quantum-classical correspondence that precisely links the real or complex nature of individual energy levels to the symmetry properties of their corresponding semiclassical orbits. Specifically, in systems with a general $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian symmetry, real energy levels are quantized along periodic orbits that preserve the corresponding classical $S_\eta$ symmetry. In contrast, complex conjugate energy levels arise from semiclassical orbits that individually break the $S_\eta$ symmetry but together form $S_\eta$-symmetric pairs. This framework provides a unified explanation for the spectral behaviors in various continuous non-Hermitian models and for the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition in two-level systems. Besides, we demonstrate that the exceptional point is inherently a quantum phenomenon, as it cannot be described by a single classical orbit. Our work uncovers the physical mechanism of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and introduces a new perspective with broad implications for the control and application of non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

Abstract: H. Lamb considered the classical dynamics of a vibrating particle embedded in an elastic medium before the development of quantum theory. Lamb was interested in how the back-action of the elastic waves generated can damp the vibrations of the particle. We propose a quantum version of Lamb's model. We show that this model is exactly solvable by using a multimode Bogoliubov transformation. We find that the exact system ground state is a multimode squeezed vacuum state, and we obtain the exact Bogoliubov frequencies by numerically solving a nonlinear integral equation. A closed-form expression for the damping rate of the particle is obtained, and it agrees with the result obtained by perturbation theory. The model provides a solvable example of the damped quantum harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moir\'e matter beyond one billion sites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e and super-moir\'e materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moir\'e systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moir\'e materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moir\'e systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moir\'e quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Oscillate and Renormalize: Fast Phonons Reshape the Kondo Effect in Flat Band Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the interplay between electron correlations and phonons in an Anderson-Holstein impurity model with an Einstein phonon. When the phonons are slow compared to charge fluctuations (frequency $\omega_0 \ll U/2$, the onsite Coulomb scale $U/2$), we demonstrate analytically that the expected phonon-mediated reduction of interactions is completely suppressed, even in the strong coupling regime. This suppression arises from the oscillator's inability to respond to rapid charge fluctuations, manifested as a compensation effect between the polaronic cloud and the excited-state phonons associated with valence fluctuations. We identify a novel frozen mixed valence phase, above a threshold dimensionless electron-phonon coupling $\alpha^*$ when the phonons are slow, where the static phonon cloud locks the impurity into specific valence configurations, potentially explaining the puzzling coexistence of mixed valence behavior and insulating properties in materials like rust. Conversely, when the phonon is fast ($\omega_0 \gtrsim U/2$), the system exhibits conventional polaronic behavior with renormalized onsite interactions effectively $U_{\text{eff}}$ due to phonon mediated attraction, with additional satellite features in the local spectral function due to phonon excitations. Using numerical renormalization group (NRG) calculations, a fully dynamic renormalization technique, we confirm these behaviors in both regimes. These findings have important implications for strongly correlated systems where phonon energy scales may be comparable to the Coulomb scale, such as in twisted bilayer graphene, necessitating careful consideration of interaction renormalizations in theoretical models.</description>

Abstract: Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.</description>
