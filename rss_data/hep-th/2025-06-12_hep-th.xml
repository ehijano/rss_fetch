      <title>Universal Observables, SUSY RG-Flows and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and analyse infinite classes of regular supergravity backgrounds dual to four-dimensional superconformal field theories (SCFTs) compactified on a circle with a supersymmetry-preserving twist. These flows lead to three-dimensional gapped QFTs preserving four supercharges. The solutions arise in Type IIB, Type IIA, and eleven-dimensional supergravity, and generalise known constructions by incorporating deformations that avoid typical singularities associated with the holographic description of the Coulomb branch of the CFT. We examine several observables: Wilson loops, holographic central charges, and complexity. We show they exhibit a universal factorisation, with each observable decomposing into a UV-CFT contribution times a flow-dependent factor. We also explore the parameter regimes where higher-curvature corrections become relevant, affecting the physical interpretation of certain observables. Our findings provide new insights into universal features of holographic RG flows and resolve a puzzle related to complexity in these systems.</description>

      <title>Hollow-grams: Generalized Entanglement Wedges from the Gravitational Path Integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bousso and Penington (BP) made a proposal for the entanglement wedge associated to a gravitating bulk region. In this paper, we derive this proposal in time-reflection symmetric settings using the gravitational path integral. To do this, we exploit the connection between random tensor networks (RTNs) and fixed-geometry states in gravity. We define the entropy of a bulk region in an RTN by removing tensors in that region and computing the entropy of the open legs thus generated in the "hollowed" RTN. We thus derive the BP proposal for RTNs and hence, also for fixed-geometry states in gravity. By then expressing a general holographic state as a superposition over fixed-geometry states and using a diagonal approximation, we provide a general gravitational path integral derivation of the BP proposal. We demonstrate that the saddles computing the R\'enyi entropy $S_n$ depend on how the bulk region is gauge-invariantly specified. Nevertheless, we show that the BP proposal is universally reproduced in the $n\to1$ limit.</description>

      <title>Large-charge R\'enyi entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charged (symmetry-resolved) vacuum R\'enyi entanglement entropy on a disk is computed in the limit of large U(1) global charge for any R\'enyi index. We show that it behaves universally for a broad class of conformal field theories including the O(2) Wilson-Fisher fixed-point, by using the effective field theory at large global charge. The result establishes one of the first concrete computations of entanglement quantities in strongly-coupled field theories.</description>

      <title>EFT Corrections to Charged Black Hole Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of higher-derivative corrections from Effective Field Theory on the quasinormal mode spectrum of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes. While previous work has explored corrections to Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes - typically using small-rotation approximations - a comprehensive analysis near extremality remains lacking. We focus on Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes as a tractable model admitting an extremal limit, enabling investigation of the effect of these corrections on the so-called zero damped modes, which dominate in this regime. Specifically, we derive a corrected Moncrief equation governing quasinormal modes and present both analytic and numerical results for the corrected frequencies. This work also offers the first explicit test of the recently proposed "Quasinormal Mode Causality" bound arXiv:2401.05524, which constrains Effective Field Theory coefficients by requiring that quasinormal mode lifetimes do not increase measurably under ultraviolet-complete Effective Field Theory corrections. Using Standard Model contributions - particularly those arising from integrating out the electron - we verify that this bound holds. Our results provide new insights into the interplay between Effective Field Theory, extremal black hole dynamics, and causality in gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonperturbative Behaviour of Moments and Cumulants in Quantum Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of quantum fields become nonperturbative when their interactions are probed by a large number of particles. To explore this regime we study correlation functions which involve a large number of fields, focussing on massive scalar theories that feature arbitrary self-interactions, $\phi^{2p}$. Treating quantum fields as operator-valued distributions, we investigate $n$-point correlation functions at ultra-short distances and compute moments and cumulants of fields, using a semiclassical saddle point approximation in the double scaling limit of weak coupling, $\lambda \to 0$, large quantum number, $n \to \infty$, while keeping $\lambda n$ constant. Addressing the nonperturbative regime, where $\lambda n \gtrsim 1$, requires a resummation of the effective saddle point to all orders in $\lambda n$. We perform this resummation in zero and one dimensions, and show that the moments, corresponding to correlation functions including disconnected contributions, grow exponentially with $n$. This growth is significantly reduced for higher-order self-interactions, i.e. for larger $p$. On the other hand, we argue that the cumulants, which represent connected correlation functions, grow even more rapidly and are mostly independent of $p$.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature Casimir effect of a Lorentz-violating scalar with higher order derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work I study the finite temperature Casimir effect caused by a complex and massive scalar field that breaks Lorentz invariance in a CPT-even, aether-like manner. The Lorentz invariance breaking is caused by a constant space-like vector directly coupled to higher order field derivatives. This vector needs to be space-like in order to avoid non-causality problems that will arise with a time-like vector. I investigate the two scenarios of the scalar field satisfying either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on a pair of flat parallel plates. I use the generalized zeta function technique that enables me to obtain the Helmholtz free energy and the Casimir pressure when the Casimir plates are in thermal equilibrium with a heat reservoir at finite temperature. I investigate two different directions of the unit vector, parallel and perpendicular to the plates. I examine both scenarios for both types of boundary conditions and, in both cases and for the two different boundary conditions, I obtain simple analytic expressions of the Casimir energy and pressure in the three asymptotic limits of small plate distance, high temperature, and large mass, examining all combinations of boundary conditions, unit vector direction, and asymptotic limits.</description>

      <title>Universality of the entropy stairway in homogeneous isotropization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy during the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 2 R-Charge Black Hole (2RCBH) model, corresponding to a top-down holographic fluid defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. In addition to the entropy, we also analyze the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. When the system is far-from-equilibrium the dominant and weak energy conditions can be transiently violated. Remarkably, for all initial conditions considered, we observe the emergence of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus forming a stairway for the entropy as the system approaches thermodynamic equilibrium. The entropy stairway allows for the entropy to encode a periodic structure without violating the second law of thermodynamics. In fact, the complex frequency of the lowest quasinormal mode (QNM) of the system is directly tied to the periodic structure of the entropy stairway. Furthermore, when the chemical potential of the fluid exceeds a certain threshold, the pressure anisotropy exhibits a late-time decay governed by a purely imaginary QNM, and as the system is doped with increasing values of R-charge chemical potential the late-time equilibration pattern of the pressure anisotropy gets increasingly deformed, eventually losing the oscillatory behavior observed at lower values of chemical potential. Taken together with previous results for the purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills (SYM) plasma and the 1 R-Charge Black Hole (1RCBH) plasma, our findings lend support to the conjecture of the universality of the entropy stairway in strongly interacting media with holographic duals undergoing homogeneous isotropization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multi-entropy and the Dihedral Measures at Quantum Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-entropy and dihedral measures are a class of tractable measures for multi-partite entanglement, which are labeled by the R\'enyi index (or replica number) $n$ as in the R\'enyi entanglement entropy. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that these quantities are new useful probes of quantum critical points by examining concrete examples. In particular, we compute the multi-entropy and dihedral measures in the $1+1$ dimensional massless free scalar field theory on a lattice and in the transverse-field Ising model. For $n=2$, we find that the numerical results in both lattice theories quantitatively agree with those from conformal field theoretic calculations. For $n=3$ and $n=4$, we provide new predictions of these measures for the massless scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Complexity equals anything for multi-horizon black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ``complexity equals anything" proposal with codimension-one and codimension-zero gravitational observables for multi-horizon black holes, using the Bardeen-AdS class black hole as an example. In particular, we compare the results with the ``complexity equals volume" (CV) proposal and find that the ``complexity equals anything" ($\mathcal{C}_{\text{gen}}$) enables the probing of a more complete black hole interior, that is, all spacetime regions where the blackening factor $f(r)&lt;0$. This is the advantage brought by the flexibility of this holographic complexity conjecture. In addition, we compute the complexity derived from various geometric quantities and show that these constructions can effectively differentiate the distinct interior regions of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Rotating Carroll Black Holes: A No Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a lot of interest in Carroll black holes and in particular whether or not one could find a Carrollian analogue of a rotating black hole spacetime. Here we show that every stationary and axisymmetric solution (and thence also a black hole) of Carrollian general relativity in any number of $d\geq 3$ dimensions is necessarily also static. Using this result, we construct a unique stationary and axisymmetric black hole in three dimensions - a static Carroll BTZ black hole. At the same time, we find a Carrollian analogue of an accelerating black hole, showing that Schwarzschild is not the only possible stationary and axisymmetric Carroll black hole in four dimensions. A generalization of the no go theorem to include Maxwell, dilatonic, and axionic matter fields is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Differential Space of Feynman Integrals: Annihilators and $\mathcal{D}$-module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel algorithm for constructing differential operators with respect to external variables that annihilate Feynman-like integrals and give rise to the associated $\mathcal{D}$-modules, based on Griffiths-Dwork reduction. By leveraging the Macaulay matrix method, we derive corresponding relations among partial differential operators, including systems of Pfaffian equations and Picard-Fuchs operators. Our computational approach is applicable to twisted period integrals in projective coordinates, and we showcase its application to Feynman graphs and Witten diagrams. The method yields annihilators and their algebraic relations for generic regulator values, explicitly avoiding contributions from surface terms. In the cases examined, we observe that the holonomic rank of the $\mathcal{D}$-modules coincides with the dimension of the corresponding de Rham co-homology groups, indicating an equivalence relation between them, which we propose as a conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>

      <title>Topological A-Model for $AdS_5\times S^5$ Superstring and the Maldacena Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological A-model constructed from $CP^{3|4}$ supertwistor variables is proposed for the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring. At zero $AdS$ radius, free N=4 d=4 super-Yang-Mills amplitudes are reproduced by topological amplitudes of the corresponding gauged linear sigma model where the closed superstring vertex operator for a trace of $k$ super-Yang-Mills fields is described by a boundary state with U(1) worldsheet instanton number $k$. After turning on a Fayet-Iliopoulis term in the sigma model with coefficient $R^2 =\sqrt{g^2 N}$, the topological amplitudes are claimed to reproduce the 't Hooft expansion of perturbative super-Yang-Mills amplitudes. Finally, this topological A-model is related to the usual $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring in the pure spinor formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study two-point correlation functions of modular Hamiltonians. We show that in general quantum systems, these correlators obey properties similar to those of von Neumann entropy and capacity of entanglement, both of which are special cases of these correlators. Then we specialize to two spacelike-separated spherical subregions in conformal field theories. We present direct computations of the vacuum two-point function that confirm its equivalence to the stress-tensor conformal block. We explore the two-point function in various kinematic regimes, including imaginary time separation between subsystems. The material presented in this note may be useful for further studying modular Hamiltonian correlators in generic quantum systems and in conformal field theories, including those with holographic duals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the tunneling process of massive scalar particles from a quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder black hole using the tunneling approach proposed by Parikh and Wilczek. We compute the emission rate of these tunneling particles, which includes quantum correction terms compared to the result in classical General Relativity. These correction terms arise from loop quantum gravity effects. Following the scheme outlined in [1, 2], we derive the entropy of the black hole. Consistent with the universal black hole entropy formula in the context of quantum gravity, our findings include a logarithmic correction.</description>

      <title>Viscosity in Isotropic Cosmological Backgrounds in General Relativity and Starobinsky Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05180v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general analysis of the role of shear viscosity in cosmological backgrounds, focusing on isotropic space-time in both Einstein and $f(R)$ gravity. By computing the divergence of the stress-energy tensor in a general class of isotropic (but not necessarily homogeneous) geometries, we show that shear viscosity does not contribute to the background dynamics when the fluid is comoving. This result holds in both the Jordan and Einstein frames, and implies that shear viscosity cannot affect the electromagnetic luminosity distance which is determined by the background light-like geodesics. As an application of our results, we critically examine recent claims that shear viscosity can alter the Hubble evolution and the electromagnetic luminosity distance in Starobinsky gravity. We demonstrate that the continuity equation used in that work is at odds both with the covariant conservation of the stress-energy tensor and the local second law of thermodynamics. We further show that even in models where such modifications could mimic bulk viscosity, the resulting entropy evolution is inconsistent with standard thermodynamic expectations.</description>

      <title>3-dimensional charged black holes in $f({Q})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new exact charged black hole solutions in (2+1) dimensions within the framework of $f({Q})$ gravity, where ${Q}$ denotes the non-metricity scalar. By considering a cubic $f({Q})$ form we derive classes of charged and uncharged spherically symmetric solutions, and we identify conditions under which these reduce to the well-known Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. Notably, our analysis reveals a novel charged solution that is asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) but cannot be continuously deformed into a GR counterpart, and thus arising purely from the
  higher-order nature of the non-metricity corrections. Furthermore, we explore the geometrical properties of the solutions, demonstrating the existence of multiple horizons and a softer central singularity compared to GR. Additionally, we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, such as Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity, with results confirming thermal stability. Finally, a detailed study of the geodesic motion and the effective potentials unveils stable photon orbits, as well as the effect of cubic non-metricity corrections on orbital dynamics.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point with neutron-star observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic model for the QCD critical endpoint (CEP) and the equation of state (EOS) at $\beta$-equilibrium, constrained by neutron-star observations. Using a hybrid framework that combines the holographic V-QCD model with an effective van der Waals description of nuclear matter, we generate a large ensemble of EOSs incorporating nuclear theory uncertainties. Constraining this ensemble with neutron-star mass-radius data and tidal deformability measurements from gravitational waves, we identify a strong first-order deconfinement transition at zero temperature, with a transition strength of $\Delta n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 3.75^{+0.70}_{-0.53}$ and onset density $n_{\rm{PT}}/n_0 = 4.9^{+1.33}_{-1.17}$. The resulting posterior yields $95\%$ credible intervals for the CEP location: $\mu_{\rm{crit}} = 626^{+90}_{-179}\,\rm{MeV}$, $T_{\rm{crit}} = 119^{+14}_{-6}\,\rm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>Precision predictions of Starobinsky inflation with self-consistent Weyl-squared corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a non-trivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.</description>

Abstract: Given a space-time $(\mathscr{M}, g_{ab})$ admitting a dynamical horizon segment (DHS) $\mathscr{H}$, we show that there are stringent constraints on the Killing fields $\xi^a$ that $g_{ab}$ can admit in a neighborhood of $\mathscr{H}$: Generically, $\xi^a$ can only be a rotational Killing field which, furthermore, leaves each marginally trapped 2-sphere cross-section $\mathcal{S}$ of $\mathscr{H}$ invariant. Finally, if $\xi^a$ happens to be hypersurface orthogonal near $\mathscr{H}$, then, not only the angular momentum but also all spin multipoles vanish on every $\mathcal{S}$; the entire spin structure of these DHSs is indistinguishable from that of spherically symmetric DHSs!</description>

      <title>Matter symmetries in supersymmetric standard models from non-invertible selection rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss phenomenological implications of non-invertible selection rules in the framework of the supersymmetric standard model. We find that a remnant $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry of fusion algebras which holds at all-loop order plays the role of $R$-parity, forbidding baryon and lepton violating operators. In addition, a combination of Standard Model gauge symmetry and the non-invertible selection rules lead to baryon triality and proton hexality that can protect the proton from decay. In general, our finding selection rules can not realize the same results as conventional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries in the supersymmetric standard model. We also clarify the assignments of matter fields under the fusion algebras that are consistent with $SU(4) \times SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $SU(5)$, and $SO(10)$ grand unified theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a Hilbert space approach to quantum mechanics (QM) where space and time are treated on an equal footing. Our approach replaces the standard dependence on an external classical time parameter with a spacetime-symmetric algebraic structure, thereby unifying the axioms that traditionally distinguish the treatment of spacelike and timelike separations. Standard quantum evolution can be recovered from timelike correlators, defined by means of a quantum action operator, a quantum version of the action of classical mechanics. The corresponding map also provides a novel perspective on the path integral (PI) formulation, which, in the case of fermions, yields an alternative to the use of Grassmann variables. In addition, the formalism can be interpreted in terms of generalized quantum states, codifying both the conventional information of a quantum system at a given time and its evolution. We show that these states are solutions to a quantum principle of stationary action enabled by the novel notion of timelike correlations.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against recent high-precision data, primarily from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6) combined with Planck, DESI BAO, and BICEP/Keck 2018 observations (P-ACT-LB-BK18). Our results indicate that while the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) for $N_*=60$ lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of the P-ACT-LB-BK18 dataset, the inclusion of GUP effects significantly shifts the predictions for the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Notably, for the GUP parameter $\beta$ values surpassing approximately $10^{13}$, the model predictions are shown to fall well within the 68\% CL region of this combined observational data, enhancing its consistency. The viable parameter space in the $\alpha-\beta$ plane is explored, revealing that a maximum $\alpha \simeq 0.74$ is consistent with the 68\% CL for $\beta \simeq 1.4\times 10^{13}$. In addition, for smaller values of $\alpha$, the predictions of the model remain inside the 68\% CL region for larger values of $\beta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tensor perturbations of the ghost-free generic non-local gravity theory constructed infinite series of higher derivative terms in $D$ dimensions. The infinite series of higher derivative terms are encoded by form factors, the forms of which can be restricted by requiring that the action remains perturbatively free of ghosts and tachyons around maximally symmetric backgrounds for transverse traceless fluctuations. To demonstrate this, we obtain field equations for AdS plane wave metric in Kerr-Schild form, which yield linearized field equations for transverse-traceless spin-$2$ field. Using unitarity and consistency requirements, we present, as an example, the explicit derivation of non-local form factors in $D$ dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We represent the multi-leg tree-level amplitudes of quarks and gluons using a minimal set of lightcone variables, which incorporate all on-shell and momentum conservation conditions and naturally captures the separate longitudinal and transverse momentum components. These variables make it easy to eliminate spurious poles and consider multi-Regge kinematic limits. In this framework we examine the factorization of tree-level amplitudes in rapidity and extract all two, three and four parton Multi-Regge Emission Vertices (MREVs), both central and peripheral, and summarise them in a Mathematica library, MREV. We investigate in detail how relations between amplitudes translate into relations between MREVs. These relations, along with factorization properties in further kinematic limits, provide robust consistency checks of the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the supercritical crossovers for black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical regime beyond the critical point, where small and large black holes are indistinguishable from the conventional viewpoint. We establish a refined supercritical phase diagram that comprehensively characterizes small, large, and indistinguishable black hole phases, whose boundaries are defined by two supercritical crossover lines. The universal scaling laws of the two crossover lines are fully verified using black hole thermodynamics in both the standard consideration and the extended thermodynamic phase space by treating the cosmological constant as a thermodynamic pressure. Remarkable analogies are observed when the supercritical phase diagrams of the two frameworks of black holes are compared to those corresponding to liquid-gas and liquid-liquid phase transitions. The present study can be extended to a variety of more complicated black hole backgrounds and provide valuable insights into the fundamental nature of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Modulated Symmetries in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Ordered Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: Quasinormal modes for bosonic (scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational) and fermionic field perturbations, radiated from black holes that carry quantum gravitational corrections at third order in the curvature to the Schwarzschild solution, are scrutinized from the propagation of analog transonic sound waves across a de Laval nozzle. The thermodynamic variables, the nozzle geometry, the Mach number, and the thrust coefficient are computed as functions of the parameter driving the effective action for quantum gravity containing a dimension-six local operator beyond general relativity. The quasinormal modes for quantum gravitational corrected analog black holes are also determined for higher overtones, yielding a more precise description of the quantum-corrected ringdown process and the gravitational waveform way before the fundamental mode sets in.</description>

Abstract: We present a complete proof of the Weak Gravity Conjecture in any perturbative bosonic string theory in spacetime dimension $D\ge6$. Our proof works by relating the black hole extremality bound to long range forces, which are more easily calculated on the worldsheet, closing the gaps in partial arguments in the existing literature. We simultaneously establish a strict, sublattice form of the conjecture in the same class of theories. We close by discussing the scope and limitations of our analysis, along with possible extensions including an upcoming generalization of our work to the superstring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the time evolution of the non-equilibrium entropy in the homogeneous isotropization dynamics of the 1RCBH model, which has a critical point in its conformal phase diagram defined at finite temperature and R-charge density. We also evaluate the time evolution of the pressure anisotropy and the scalar condensate of the medium. We disclose a new feature (not present in the Bjorken flow dynamics analyzed in previous works), which is observed for all the analyzed initial data: the formation of a periodic sequence of several close plateaus in the form of a stairway for the entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the period of plateau formation in the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode of the system, which is therefore strongly tied to the late time dissipative dynamics of the system associated to the irreversibility of entropy production. For the particular case of the purely thermal SYM plasma at zero density and vanishing scalar condensate, we find that the period of the stairway is half the period of oscillations of the slowest quasinormal mode associated to the late time equilibration of the pressure anisotropy of the fluid, while at finite chemical potential the slowest quasinormal mode of the system is associated to the late time equilibration of the scalar condensate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the bulk dual of holography, huge operators correspond to sources so heavy that they fully backreact on the space-time geometry. Here we study the correlation function of three such huge operators when they are given by $1/2$ BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory, dual to IIB Strings in $AdS_5 \times S^5$. We unveil simple matrix model representations for these correlators which we can sometimes solve analytically. For general huge operators, we translate these matrix model expressions into a $1+1$ dimensional hydrodynamical fluid problem. This fluid is integrable thus unveiling a novel integrable sector of the $AdS/CFT$ duality in a full fledged gravitational regime, very far from the usual free string planar regime where integrability reigns supreme. We explain how an adiabatic deformation method can be developed to yield the solution to an integrable discrete formulation of these fluids -- the rational Calogero-Moser Model -- so we can access the general three point correlation functions of generic huge $1/2$-BPS operators. Everything will be done on the gauge theory side of the duality. It would be fascinating to find the holographic dual of these matrix models and fluids.</description>

      <title>Gravity from AKSZ-Manin theories in two, three, and four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that various dynamical gauge theories in two, three and four dimensions, obtained as Manin deformations of topological Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky (AKSZ) theories, are equivalent to gravitational theories. Since gravity is topological in two and three dimension, this equivalence requires a diffeomorphism breaking background source term. In four dimensions, however, the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant is obtained identically via the Manin deformation of a particular AKSZ theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal effective action and particle creation in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation rate in the context of quantum fields in curved spacetimes, by evaluating the imaginary part of the effective action up to second order in the curvatures. For arbitrary metrics in dimensions $D\geq4$, we express the vacuum persistence amplitude in terms of the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor, showing that, up to their second power, no particle creation occurs for conformal fields in conformally flat spacetimes. We pinpoint an analogy with the electromagnetic pair creation, by writing the squared Weyl tensor invariant in terms of its electric and magnetic parts. In addition, we present an alternative expression for the imaginary part of the effective action employing the Cotton tensor. This is particularly useful in $D=3$, where the Weyl tensor trivially vanishes and the Cotton tensor is related to conformal flatness. Finally, we highlight the importance of the threshold for particle creation, a point that has been overlooked in some recent studies.</description>

      <title>Chiral global embedding of Fibre Inflation with $\overline{\rm D3}$ uplift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carefully analyse the challenges posed by the construction of type IIB chiral global embeddings of Fibre Inflation with $\overline{ \rm D3}$ uplift to a de Sitter vacuum. We present an explicit example involving an $h^{1,1}=4$ Calabi-Yau manifold with a K3 fibration and a del Pezzo divisor supporting non-perturbative effects. The chosen orientifold involution induces O3-planes that can be placed on top of each other at the tip of the throat of a deformed conifold singularity. The D7-brane sector contains standard magnetised branes and a Whitney brane. The former induce chiral matter and generate quantum effects that stabilise the K\"ahler moduli, while the latter helps to increase the total D3-charge. We study in detail the constraints on the parameter space leading to an observationally viable inflationary dynamics, finding several regions where the effective field theory is under control.</description>

      <title>Sphere free energy of scalar field theories with cubic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimensional continuation approach to calculating the free energy of $d$-dimensional Euclidean CFT on the round sphere $S^d$ has been used to develop its $4-\epsilon$ expansion for a number of well-known non-supersymmetric theories, such as the $O(N)$ model. The resulting estimate of the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in good agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs on $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their resummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the theories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary universality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are continued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a field theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is described by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic theory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to describe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our work, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators containing the curvature. We also use another method for approximating $F$, which relies on perturbation theory around the bilocal action near the long-range/short-range crossover. The numerical values it gives for $F$ tend to be in good agreement with other available methods.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions under imaginary rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we investigate the properties of an ensemble of free Dirac fermions, at finite inverse temperature $\beta$ and finite chemical potential $\mu$, undergoing rigid rotation with an imaginary angular velocity $\Omega=i\Omega_I$. Our purpose is to establish the analytical structure of such states, as well as the prospects (and dangers) of extrapolating results obtained under imaginary rotation to the case of real rotation. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, the state of the system is akin to a stationary system with modified inverse temperature $\beta_q = q\beta$ and the same chemical potential, where $q$ is the denominator of the irreducible fraction $\nu = \beta \Omega_I / 2\pi = p/q$. The temperature of the system becomes a fractal function of the rotation parameter, as in the case of the scalar field. The chemical potential breaks the fractalization of fermions. We also compute the thermodynamic potential $\Phi$ and associated thermodynamic functions, showing that they also exhibit fractal behavior. Finally, we evaluate the axial and helical fluxes through the transverse plane, generated through the vortical effects, and show that they diverge in the thermodynamic limit, in the case when $\nu = 1/q$ and $q \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity observables: observation, algebras, and mathematical structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The questions of describing observables and observation in quantum gravity appear to be centrally important to its physics. A relational approach holds significant promise, and a classification of different types of relational observables (gravitationally dressed, field relational, and more general) is outlined. Plausibly gravitationally dressed observables are particularly closely tied to the fundamental structure of the theory. These may be constructed in the quantum theory to leading order in Newton's constant, and raise important questions about localization of information. Approximate localization is given by a "standard dressing" construction of a "gravitational splitting." It is also argued that such gravitational dressings give a generalization of the crossed product construction, reducing to this and yielding type II von Neumann algebras in special cases. Gravity therefore introduces a significantly more general alteration of the algebraic structure of local quantum field theory, also with apparent connections to holography, but whose implications have not been fully understood. In particular, properties of the algebra of gravitationally dressed observables suggest a possible role for other non-algebraic structure on the Hilbert space for quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ super Yang--Mills theory on an AdS background. We propose that the boundary conditions that preserve the AdS super-isometries are determined by maximizing the real part of the AdS partition function $F_{\text{AdS}}=-\log Z_{\text{AdS}}$. At weak coupling $\Lambda L \ll 1$ the maximization singles out the Dirichlet boundary condition with an $SU(2)$ boundary global symmetry, corresponding to the classical vacuum at the origin of the Coulomb branch with fully un-higgsed gauge group. We find that for $\Lambda L \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ new boundary conditions are favored, with gauge-group higgsed down to $U(1)$, matching the expectation from the flat space limit. We use supersymmetric localization to compute $Z_{\text{AdS}}$ nonperturbatively. We further provide evidence for a relation between $F_{\text{AdS}}$ and the $\mathcal{N}=2$ prepotential in AdS background.</description>

Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

Abstract: Symbol letters are crucial for analytically calculating Feynman integrals in terms of iterated integrals. We present a novel method to construct the symbol letters for a given integral family without prior knowledge of the canonical differential equations. We provide a program package implementing our algorithm, and demonstrate its effectiveness in solving non-trivial problems with multiple loops and legs. Using our method, we successfully bootstrap the canonical differential equations for a two-loop five-point family with two external masses and for a three-loop four-point family with two external masses, which were previously unknown in the literature. We anticipate that our method can be applied to a wide range of cutting-edge calculations in the future.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon=1/3-\phi$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Using the IPAD-TOV method based on an Intrinsic and Perturbatively Analysis of the Dimensionless (IPAD) Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv GM_{\rm{NS}}/Rc^2\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\overline{\Pi}_{\rm{c}}\equiv\Pi_{\rm{c}}\cdot(1+18\x/25)\equiv\x/(1+3\x^2+4\x)\cdot(1+18\rm{X}/25)$ where $\x\equiv\phi_{\rm{c}}= P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\x$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-insensitively the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Forecast Analysis of Astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background beyond general relativity: A Case Study on Brans-Dicke Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor gravity, exemplified by Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity, introduces additional scalar polarization modes that contribute scalar radiation alongside tensor modes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of how gravitational wave generation and propagation effects under Brans-Dicke gravity are encoded into the astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (AGWB). We perform end-to-end analyses of realistic populations of simulated coalescing binary systems to generate AGWB mock data with third-generation gravitational wave detectors and conducted a complete Bayesian analysis for the first time. We find the uncertainties in the population properties of binary black holes (BBH) significantly affect the ability to constrain BD gravity. Furthermore, we explore the detectability of potential scalar backgrounds that originates from binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers, with NSBH systems expected to modify the spectral index of the scalar background and introduce oscillatory behavior. We show that the observations of the AGWB enable the separation of mixed tensor and scalar polarization modes with comparable sensitivity to each mode. However, the scalar background is expected to remain substantially weaker than the tensor background, even in scenarios where BD gravity exhibits significant deviations from general relativity (GR), resulting only upper limits can be placed on the scalar background. We conclude that for ambiguous populations, employing waveform matching with individual sources provides a more robust approach to constrain BD gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves cause freely falling spinning objects to precess, resulting in a net orientation change called gyroscopic memory. In this paper, we will consider isolated gravitational sources in the post-Newtonian framework and compute the gyroscopic precession and memory at leading post-Newtonian (PN) orders. We compare two competing contributions: the spin memory and the nonlinear helicity flux. At the level of the precession rate, the former is a 2PN oscillatory effect, while the latter is a 4PN adiabatic effect. However, the gyroscopic memory involves a time integration, which enhances subleading adiabatic effects by the fifth power of the velocity of light, leading to a 1.5PN memory effect. We explicitly compute the leading effects for a quasi-circular binary system and obtain the angular dependence of the memory on the celestial sphere.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD Critical End Point with Finite-Size Scaling of Net-Baryon Cumulant Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) critical end point (CEP) is a central objective in heavy-ion physics, offering key insights into the phase structure of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. In this study, finite-size scaling (FSS) analysis is applied to cumulant ratios -- \( C_2/C_1 \), \( C_3/C_2 \), \( C_4/C_2 \), \( C_3/C_1 \), and \( C_4/C_1 \) -- measured in Au+Au collisions across the Beam Energy Scan (BES-I) range of \( \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7\text{--}200\,\text{GeV} \). The observed scaling behavior reflects the influence of finite-size and finite-time effects, which suppress raw non-monotonic signals and render background-subtraction-based approaches to critical point identification severely unreliable. The scaling functions yield a CEP location at \( \sqrt{s}_{\text{CEP}} \approx 33.0\,\text{GeV} \), corresponding to \( \mu_{B,\text{CEP}} \approx 130\,\text{MeV} \) and \( T_{\text{CEP}} \approx 158.5\,\text{MeV} \) based on empirical freeze-out parametrizations. Distinct divergence patterns -- upward for \( C_2/C_1 \) and \( C_4/C_1 \), and downward for \( C_3/C_1 \), \( C_3/C_2 \), and \( C_4/C_2 \) -- align with predictions from the 3D Ising universality class. These results demonstrate the sensitivity of cumulant ratios as robust, model-independent probes of critical behavior and support the identification of the CEP's location and universality class.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of $f(Q)$ cosmology with quintom-like scenario: the phantom field as effective realization of the non-trivial connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $f(Q)$ cosmology with a non-trivial connection, namely the Connection II of the literature, is dynamically equivalent with a quintom-like model. In particular, we show that the scalar field arising from the non-linear $f(Q)$ form, and the scalar field associated to the non-trivial connection, are combined to provide one canonical and one phantom field in the minisuperspace Lagrangian. Hence, the combination of two well-behaved fields appears effectively as a phantom field. This is fundamentally different from the usual approach in phantom and quintom cosmology, in which the phantom field is introduced ad hoc, and thus it may open a new way to handle the phantom fields, namely as effective realizations of the connection-related canonical fields.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of Turbulent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution for incompressible turbulent mixing governed by the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, with a passive scalar (such as concentration or temperature) advected by the turbulent velocity field. Building on our recent formulation of decaying turbulence via the Euler ensemble, we express the correlation functions of the passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble.
  Employing a novel and significantly simplified method for computing the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble, we derive the scalar energy spectrum and its scaling functions. The leading term of the spectrum exhibits universal decay as $t^{-5/4}$, independent of the Schmidt number - mirroring the decay of turbulent kinetic energy. However, the subleading contributions differ markedly and reveal a rich structure: we obtain a universal closed-form expression involving sums and integrals, with power-law exponents restricted to negative half-integer values.
  Although the scaling exponents are universal, the corresponding pre-exponential factors show strong dependence on the Schmidt number. This sensitivity may give the appearance of non-universality in direct numerical simulations (DNS), unless properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>A survey of knots and quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey explores knot polynomials and their categorification, culminating in the homological invariants of knots. We begin with an overview of classical knot polynomials, progressing towards the superpolynomial and its role in unifying various knot homologies. Along the way, we provide physical and geometric insights into the unification of the $sl(N)$ Khovanov-Rozansky and the knot Floer homology. We then turn our attention to the intriguing correspondence between knots and quivers, examining how this perspective sheds light on the integrality of BPS states encoded in the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants. We will further investigate the knot-quiver correspondence from a physics and geometric side and study the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[Q_K]$ for the quivers.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Charged Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the mass and charge of the initial black hole as well as those of the injected shell.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description>
