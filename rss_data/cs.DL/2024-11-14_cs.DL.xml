      <title>What is wrong with MDPI: Is it a predator or a serious competitor?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hunt for predatory journals is based on binary division of the publishing world to legitime and predatory journals. This leads to difficulties in labeling publishers like MDPI with questionable practices. However, the root cause is not the publisher itself but the problems in the peer review system. These problems have created markets for the for-profit publishers shaking the understanding of conservative researchers and their belief about what is good science. In this paper, we analyze the problems via examples based on our own experience as author, reviewer, guest editor, associate editor, and editor-in-chief. We discuss how MDPI has addressed these problems.</description>

      <title>GREI Data Repository AI Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative (GREI), funded by the NIH, developed an AI taxonomy tailored to data repository roles to guide AI integration across repository management. It categorizes the roles into stages, including acquisition, validation, organization, enhancement, analysis, sharing, and user support, providing a structured framework for implementing AI in repository workflows.</description>

      <title>DecentPeeR: A Self-Incentivised &amp; Inclusive Decentralized Peer Review System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review, as a widely used practice to ensure the quality and integrity of publications, lacks a well-defined and common mechanism to self-incentivize virtuous behavior across all the conferences and journals. This is because information about reviewer efforts and author feedback typically remains local to a single venue, while the same group of authors and reviewers participate in the publication process across many venues. Previous attempts to incentivize the reviewing process assume that the quality of reviews and papers authored correlate for the same person, or they assume that the reviewers can receive physical rewards for their work. In this paper, we aim to keep track of reviewing and authoring efforts by users (who review and author) across different venues while ensuring self-incentivization. We show that our system, DecentPeeR, incentivizes reviewers to behave according to the rules, i.e., it has a unique Nash equilibrium in which virtuous behavior is rewarded.</description>

      <title>Scholarly Wikidata: Population and Exploration of Conference Data in Wikidata using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several initiatives have been undertaken to conceptually model the domain of scholarly data using ontologies and to create respective Knowledge Graphs. Yet, the full potential seems unleashed, as automated means for automatic population of said ontologies are lacking, and respective initiatives from the Semantic Web community are not necessarily connected: we propose to make scholarly data more sustainably accessible by leveraging Wikidata's infrastructure and automating its population in a sustainable manner through LLMs by tapping into unstructured sources like conference Web sites and proceedings texts as well as already existing structured conference datasets. While an initial analysis shows that Semantic Web conferences are only minimally represented in Wikidata, we argue that our methodology can help to populate, evolve and maintain scholarly data as a community within Wikidata. Our main contributions include (a) an analysis of ontologies for representing scholarly data to identify gaps and relevant entities/properties in Wikidata, (b) semi-automated extraction -- requiring (minimal) manual validation -- of conference metadata (e.g., acceptance rates, organizer roles, programme committee members, best paper awards, keynotes, and sponsors) from websites and proceedings texts using LLMs. Finally, we discuss (c) extensions to visualization tools in the Wikidata context for data exploration of the generated scholarly data. Our study focuses on data from 105 Semantic Web-related conferences and extends/adds more than 6000 entities in Wikidata. It is important to note that the method can be more generally applicable beyond Semantic Web-related conferences for enhancing Wikidata's utility as a comprehensive scholarly resource.

      <title>Know Their Name: An Anthology of Great Women in the Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a long history of women innovators producing outstanding contributions to society and public benefit yet having their work passed over or sidelined or attributed to male colleagues. This phenomenon has been coined the Matilda Effect. The amendments to the record of human achievements are now taking place, with an increasing pace in recent times due to greater social enlightenment and awareness and the interest in social justice. However, there remains a gap that must be addressed. In this article, we demonstrate the disparity in scientific recognition for a handful of case studies through search data collected via Google Trends and plotted as time-series figures and choropleth maps. Search trends reflect a noticeable divergence between recognition of female and male innovators. However, we note that in more well-known cases of the Matilda Effect, such as the historical account of Rosalind Franklin vs. James Watson and Francis Crick, the differences become less pronounced, emphasizing the importance of publicizing recognition. In response to this revelation, this article presents the stories of several women innovators and their great achievements. We identify the truth behind several discoveries and inventions, while revealing the full nature of this historical problem of social exclusion.</description>
