      <title>Swan modules and homotopy types after a single stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Swan modules, which are a special class of projective modules over integral group rings, and their consequences for the homotopy classification of CW-complexes. We show that there exists a non-free stably free Swan module, thus resolving Problem A4 in the 1979 Problem List of C. T. C. Wall. As an application we show that, in all dimensions $n \equiv 3$ mod $4$, there exist finite $n$-complexes which are homotopy equivalent after stabilising with multiple copies of $S^n$, but not after a single stabilisation. This answers a question of M. N. Dyer.
  We also resolve a question of S. Plotnick concerning Swan modules associated to group automorphisms and, as an application, obtain a short and direct proof that there exists a group with $k$-periodic cohomology which does not have free period $k$. In contrast to the original proof our R. J. Milgram, our proof circumvents the need to compute the Swan finiteness obstruction.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Stratified Space Structure of an RL Game with the Volume Growth Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL) game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of "spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.</description>

      <title>Geometric Bounds for Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we offer a new perspective on persistent homology by integrating key concepts from metric geometry. For a given compact subset $\mathcal{X}$ of a Banach space $\mathbf{Y}$, we analyze the topological features arising in the family $\mathcal{N}_\bullet(\mathcal{X} \subset \mathbf{Y})$ of nested neighborhoods of $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbf{Y}$ and provide several geometric bounds on their persistence (lifespans).
  We begin by examining the lifespans of these homology classes in terms of their filling radii in $\mathbf{Y}$, establishing connections between these lifespans and fundamental invariants in metric geometry, such as the Urysohn width. We then derive bounds on these lifespans by considering the $\ell^\infty$-principal components of $\mathcal{X}$, also known as Kolmogorov widths.
  Additionally, we introduce and investigate the concept of extinction time of a metric space $\mathcal{X}$: the critical threshold beyond which no homological features persist in any degree. We propose methods for estimating the \v{C}ech and Vietoris-Rips extinction times of $\mathcal{X}$ by relating $\mathcal{X}$ to its convex hull and to its tight span, respectively.</description>

      <title>Type 2 complexes constructed from Brown-Gitler spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper, one of us interpreted mod 2 Dyer-Lashof operations as explicit A-module extensions between Brown-Gitler modules, and showed these A-modules can be topologically realized by finite spectra occurring as fibers of maps between 2-local dual Brown-Gitler spectra.
  Starting from these constructions, in this paper, we show that infinite families of these finite spectra are of chromatic type 2, with mod 2 cohomology that is free over A(1). Applications include classifying the dual Brown-Gitler spectra after localization with respect to K-theory.</description>
