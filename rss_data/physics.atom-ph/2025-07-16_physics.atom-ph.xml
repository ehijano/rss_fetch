      <title>Trajectory-based models in strong-field physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review various semiclassical models for strong-field physics. These semiclassical models employ ensembles of classical trajectories to simulate electron motion in the continuum after being released from an atom or molecule by an external laser field. We discuss different approaches to trajectory-based simulations and identify their advantages and shortcomings. We also review some of the recent applications of semiclassical models to the key strong-field phenomena: above-threshold ionization, high-order harmonic generation, nonsequential double ionization, and frustrated tunneling ionization.</description>

      <title>Convergent close-coupling approach to ion collisions with multi-electron targets: Application to $\bar{p} + {\rm C}$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The single-centre convergent close-coupling approach to ion-atom collisions has been extended to model collisions involving arbitrary multi-electron atoms and partially stripped ions. This is accomplished by generating a set of target pseudostates using the configuration interaction method. The resulting pseudostates are expanded in terms of configuration state functions, constructed using a hybrid of Hartree-Fock and Coulomb-Sturmian spin-orbitals. This new approach is applied to study antiproton collisions with atomic carbon. We present excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and the dipole polarisability obtained using the target structure model to validate its accuracy. Furthermore, we present results for elastic-scattering, total excitation, and ionisation cross sections in the incident energy range between 10 to 1000 keV. State-resolved excitation cross sections for the first few dominant transitions are also presented. Throughout the manuscript, we compare results obtained using the multi-core target structure model with those from a frozen-core one. In all cases, we find that a multi-core description of the carbon atom target is essential for accurately modelling these collisions.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Variational studies of ro-vibrational spectra of DT$^+$ and T$_2^+$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the last two hydrogen molecular ion isotopologues: DT$^+$ and T$_2^+$, for which high-precision calculations have not yet been made. We obtain the nonrelativistic solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation for the wide range of vibrational states up to the highest possible vibrational $1s\sigma_g$ state which are of spectroscopic precision. Transition amplitudes for electric dipole transitions, leading-order relativistic corrections and coefficients of the effective hyperfine structure Hamiltonians for both DT$^+$ and T$_2^+$ are also calculated.</description>

      <title>Chirped magneto-optical trap of molybdenum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have directly loaded a cryogenic beam of molybdenum atoms into a magneto-optical trap. By chirping the detuning of the trapping lasers, we were able to enhance the number of atoms loaded into the trap by more than a factor of two. We optimize the trapped samples for atom number, temperature, and lifetime by varying the laser-cooling parameters . The laser-cooled molybdenum atoms are subsequently transferred to a magnetic trap where we achieve vacuum-limited lifetimes of 100 ms. Comparison of magneto-optical trap and magnetic trap lifetimes allow us to extract partial decay rates of the $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_4$ and $\text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4\rightarrow\text{a}\,^5\text{D}_3$. We also provide measurements of the isotope shifts for the $\text{a}\,^7\text{S}_3\rightarrow \text{z}\,^7\text{P}^\text{o}_4$ transition with up to four times better precision than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Phase Transition and Cascade of Instabilities in the Dissipative Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model describes a two-level system coupled to a harmonic oscillator. A Gaussian phase transition for the nonequilibrium steady states has been predicted when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping. We show that oscillator dephasing is a relevant perturbation, which leads to a non-Gaussian phase transition and an intriguing cascade of instabilities for $k$-th order bosonic operators. For the soft-mode limit, the equations of motion form a closed hierarchy and spectral properties can be efficiently studied. To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and relevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization, perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory.</description>

      <title>A graphene platform for nano scale coherent interaction of surface plasmons with resonant atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a 2D graphene structure containing atomic ensemble as a platform for implementing nanoscale enhanced coherent interactions of plasmonic fields with resonant atomic systems. We determine the graphene surface plasmon modes, and the properties of its electromagnetic fields, and emphasize the role of graphene sheet separation on the interaction with atomic systems for various dipole orientations and positions between the graphene sheets. We analyze the conditions for implementation of coherent interaction of SP mode with resonant atomic ensembles. By solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the resonant interaction of surface plasmons with atoms, we derive the modified area theorem, which makes it possible to identify the most common nonlinear patterns in the behavior of plasmons under the studied conditions. We obtain analytical and numerical solutions of the area theorem, and find the possibility of stable propagation of isolated SP pulses of graphene surface plasmon modes at "fractional" pulse area values relative to $\pi$. We show that the coherent dynamics of SP fields can be realized in nanoscale design and we highlight the possibilities of using this scheme of coherent dynamics for implementing compact multimode nanoscale quantum memory and its integration with other quantum devices on the proposed platform.</description>

      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Surface and chemical effects on $^{199}$Hg spin polarization relaxation in optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin magnetometry using optically pumped $^{199}$Hg has been successfully used in many fundamental physics experiments. A serious problem that has not been resolved is the instability of the $^{199}$Hg spin relaxation rate in atomic vapor cells under irradiation with 254 nm Hg resonance light. In this paper, previously obtained data are re-analyzed or analyzed for the first time. The effects of impurities of H$_2$ and O$_2$ are elucidated, and possible ways to stabilize cells are discussed. Surface states originating from the an der Waals interaction of \hg with fused silica are analyzed and shown to be critical to understanding relaxation mechanisms. A discussion of the possible use of a mixture of N$_2$O and other gases is presented.</description>
