      <title>Expressive MIDI-format Piano Performance Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a generative neural network that's able to generate expressive piano performance in MIDI format. The musical expressivity is reflected by vivid micro-timing, rich polyphonic texture, varied dynamics, and the sustain pedal effects. This model is innovative from many aspects of data processing to neural network design. We claim that this symbolic music generation model overcame the common critics of symbolic music and is able to generate expressive music flows as good as, if not better than generations with raw audio. One drawback is that, due to the limited time for submission, the model is not fine-tuned and sufficiently trained, thus the generation may sound incoherent and random at certain points. Despite that, this model shows its powerful generative ability to generate expressive piano pieces.</description>

      <title>Six Dragons Fly Again: Reviving 15th-Century Korean Court Music with Transformers and Novel Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a project that revives a piece of 15th-century Korean court music, Chihwapyeong and Chwipunghyeong, composed upon the poem Songs of the Dragon Flying to Heaven. One of the earliest examples of Jeongganbo, a Korean musical notation system, the remaining version only consists of a rudimentary melody. Our research team, commissioned by the National Gugak (Korean Traditional Music) Center, aimed to transform this old melody into a performable arrangement for a six-part ensemble. Using Jeongganbo data acquired through bespoke optical music recognition, we trained a BERT-like masked language model and an encoder-decoder transformer model. We also propose an encoding scheme that strictly follows the structure of Jeongganbo and denotes note durations as positions. The resulting machine-transformed version of Chihwapyeong and Chwipunghyeong were evaluated by experts and performed by the Court Music Orchestra of National Gugak Center. Our work demonstrates that generative models can successfully be applied to traditional music with limited training data if combined with careful design.</description>

      <title>Nested Music Transformer: Sequentially Decoding Compound Tokens in Symbolic Music and Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing symbolic music with compound tokens, where each token consists of several different sub-tokens representing a distinct musical feature or attribute, offers the advantage of reducing sequence length. While previous research has validated the efficacy of compound tokens in music sequence modeling, predicting all sub-tokens simultaneously can lead to suboptimal results as it may not fully capture the interdependencies between them. We introduce the Nested Music Transformer (NMT), an architecture tailored for decoding compound tokens autoregressively, similar to processing flattened tokens, but with low memory usage. The NMT consists of two transformers: the main decoder that models a sequence of compound tokens and the sub-decoder for modeling sub-tokens of each compound token. The experiment results showed that applying the NMT to compound tokens can enhance the performance in terms of better perplexity in processing various symbolic music datasets and discrete audio tokens from the MAESTRO dataset.</description>

      <title>MuChoMusic: Evaluating Music Understanding in Multimodal Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal models that jointly process audio and language hold great promise in audio understanding and are increasingly being adopted in the music domain. By allowing users to query via text and obtain information about a given audio input, these models have the potential to enable a variety of music understanding tasks via language-based interfaces. However, their evaluation poses considerable challenges, and it remains unclear how to effectively assess their ability to correctly interpret music-related inputs with current methods. Motivated by this, we introduce MuChoMusic, a benchmark for evaluating music understanding in multimodal language models focused on audio. MuChoMusic comprises 1,187 multiple-choice questions, all validated by human annotators, on 644 music tracks sourced from two publicly available music datasets, and covering a wide variety of genres. Questions in the benchmark are crafted to assess knowledge and reasoning abilities across several dimensions that cover fundamental musical concepts and their relation to cultural and functional contexts. Through the holistic analysis afforded by the benchmark, we evaluate five open-source models and identify several pitfalls, including an over-reliance on the language modality, pointing to a need for better multimodal integration. Data and code are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Improving Audio Spectrogram Transformers for Sound Event Detection Through Multi-Stage Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This technical report describes the CP-JKU team's submission for Task 4 Sound Event Detection with Heterogeneous Training Datasets and Potentially Missing Labels of the DCASE 24 Challenge. We fine-tune three large Audio Spectrogram Transformers, PaSST, BEATs, and ATST, on the joint DESED and MAESTRO datasets in a two-stage training procedure. The first stage closely matches the baseline system setup and trains a CRNN model while keeping the large pre-trained transformer model frozen. In the second stage, both CRNN and transformer are fine-tuned using heavily weighted self-supervised losses. After the second stage, we compute strong pseudo-labels for all audio clips in the training set using an ensemble of all three fine-tuned transformers. Then, in a second iteration, we repeat the two-stage training process and include a distillation loss based on the pseudo-labels, boosting single-model performance substantially. Additionally, we pre-train PaSST and ATST on the subset of AudioSet that comes with strong temporal labels, before fine-tuning them on the Task 4 datasets.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Distribution Detection for Audio-visual Generalized Zero-Shot Learning: A General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is a challenging task requiring accurate classification of both seen and unseen classes. Within this domain, Audio-visual GZSL emerges as an extremely exciting yet difficult task, given the inclusion of both visual and acoustic features as multi-modal inputs. Existing efforts in this field mostly utilize either embedding-based or generative-based methods. However, generative training is difficult and unstable, while embedding-based methods often encounter domain shift problem. Thus, we find it promising to integrate both methods into a unified framework to leverage their advantages while mitigating their respective disadvantages. Our study introduces a general framework employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to harness the strengths of both approaches. We first employ generative adversarial networks to synthesize unseen features, enabling the training of an OOD detector alongside classifiers for seen and unseen classes. This detector determines whether a test feature belongs to seen or unseen classes, followed by classification utilizing separate classifiers for each feature type. We test our framework on three popular audio-visual datasets and observe a significant improvement comparing to existing state-of-the-art works. Codes can be found in https://github.com/liuyuan-wen/AV-OOD-GZSL.</description>
