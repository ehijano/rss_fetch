      <title>Isotropic Rank of Harmonic Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any homogeneous harmonic polynomial can be decomposed as a sum of powers of isotropic linear forms, that is, linear forms whose coefficients are the coordinates of isotropic points. The minimum size of such decompositions for a harmonic polynomial is called its isotropic rank. As with the Waring rank, the problem of determining the isotropic rank of a given harmonic form is very hard. We determine the isotropic rank of a general harmonic form providing a full classification of the dimensions of secant varieties of the variety of d-powers of isotropic linear forms in n+1 variables, for every n,d, thus obtaining the analogue of the widely-celebrated Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. Moreover, we completely solve the problem of determining the isotropic rank for the following classes of harmonic forms: ternary forms, quadrics and monomials.</description>

      <title>Detecting Direct Sums of Tensors and Their Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize Mammana's classification of limits of direct sums to more than two factors. We also extend it from polynomials to arbitrary Segre-Veronese format, generalising and unifying results of Buczy\'nska-Buczy\'nski-Kleppe-Teitler, Hwang, Wang, and Wilson. Remarkably, in such much more general setup it is still possible to characterise the possible limits. Our proofs are direct and based on the theory of centroids, in particular avoiding the delicate Betti number arguments.</description>

      <title>A motivic Weil height machine for curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational points of a smooth curve $X$ over a number field $k$ map to the set of augmentations of the associated motivic algebra. An expectation, related to Kim's conjecture, is that for $X$ hyperbolic, the set of augmentations which come locally at each place of $k$ from a point is equal to the set of rational points. Our view is that this should provide a relative of the Grothendieck section conjecture which may be both more accessible, and more directly applicable, than the latter.
  As a first step in this direction, we extend aspects of the ``Weil height machine'' to the set of such augmentations, and use this to prove a Manin--Dem'janenko-style finiteness result for motivic augmentations for particular curves. Along the way, we determine the structure of the cohomological motive of a $\mathbb{G}_m$-bundle over an algebraic variety as a highly structured algebra in the derived $\infty$-category of mixed motives with rational coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Seshadri region of a subvariety, a convex region packaging the classical Seshadri constants with respect to every line bundle simultaneously. We develop the theory of Seshadri regions as a measure of positivity along subvarieties and apply it to determine asymptotic Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity for ideal powers and symmetric powers on smooth projective toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Stability Conditions for Multigraded Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a finitely generated abelian group and $S$ a $D$-graded ring. We introduce a geometric semistability condition for points $x \in \Spec(S)$, characterized by maximal-dimensional orbit cones $\sigma(x)$. This set of geometrically semistable points $X^{\mathrm{gss}}$ yields a new framework for the $D$-graded Proj construction, which is equivalently given as the geometric quotient of $D(S_+) = \Spec(S) \setminus V(S_+)$ by the torus $\Spec(S_0[D])$, where $S_+ \unlhd S$ is the ideal generated by all relevant elements.
  We show that orbit cones are unions of relevant cones $\CC_D(f)$. This yields a chamber decomposition of the weight space $\sigma(S) = \overline{\Cone}(d \in D \mid S_d \neq 0)$, determined entirely by relevant elements. In particular, we obtain $\Proj^D(S) = X^{\mathrm{gss}}\sslash \Spec(S_0[D])$.
  As an application, for a simplicial toric (pre-)variety $X$ with full-dimensional convex support and $S = \Cox(X)$, this chamber decomposition of its weight space recovers the secondary fan of $X$. Consequently, when $d \in D = \Cl(X)$, the space $\Proj^D(S)$ is exactly the direct limit of all GIT quotients $\BA^n \sslash_{\chi^d} \Spec(S_0[D])$ of $X$.</description>

      <title>More counterexamples to the Arithmetic Puncturing Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct examples of threefolds with terminal singularities (resp. surfaces with canonical singularities) which are special in the sense of Campana, have a potentially dense set of integral points, admit a dense entire curve, have vanishing Kobayashi pseudometric, and are geometrically special in the sense of Javanpeykar-Rousseau but whose regular locus fails to have any of these properties. This improves on earlier work by Cadorel-Campana-Rousseau and joint work by the author with Javanpeykar-Levin, where such fourfolds with canonical singularities were constructed, and gives refined answers to questions due to Hassett-Tschinkel and Kamenova-Lehn. Lastly, we show that some of our examples satisfy the weak approximation property and briefly discuss a question on puncturing varieties satisfying strong approximation raised by Wittenberg.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an optimal upper bound for local volumes of Gorenstein canonical non-hypersurface threefold singularities. Specifically, we show that a klt threefold singularity with local volume at least $9$ is either a hypersurface singularity or a quotient singularity. As applications, we obtain new restrictions on the singularities of members in K-moduli spaces of Fano threefolds, and we establish a sharp inequality between local volumes and minimal log discrepancies for threefold singularities.</description>

      <title>On the integral variation map of isolated plane curves singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integral variation map and algebraic monodromy of isolated plane curve singularities are important homological invariants of the singularity which are still far from being completely understood. This work provides effective ways of computing them with respect to an explicit geometric basis of the homology.
  For any given topological type of plane curve singularity, we construct an analytic model of it, along with a vector field on our version of its A'Campo space. This vector field is tangent to the Milnor fibers at radius zero and the union of the stable manifolds of their singularities yields a spine of each fiber, which can be described explicitly. This is very much inspired by a recent work of the authors.
  Our first main contribution is the algorithmic computation of the algebraic monodromy and integral variation map as matrices with explicit bases for any Milnor fiber in the Milnor fibration, not merely congruence classes. For our second contribution, we introduce gyrographs which are graphs equipped with angular data and rational weights. We prove that the invariant spine naturally carries a gyrograph structure were the weights are given by the Hironaka numbers, and that this structure recovers the geometric monodromy as a homotopy class, as well as the integral variation map. This provides a combinatorial framework for computation by hand. Our methods are further implemented in a publicly availablecomputer program written in Python.</description>

      <title>A new bound on the rank of tensor product of W-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A W-state is an order d symmetric tensor of the form W_d=x^{d-1}y. We prove that the partially symmetric rank of W_{d_1}\otimes \cdots \otimes W_{d_k} is at most 2^{k-1}(d_1+\cdots +d_k-2k+2). The same bound holds for the tensor rank and it is an improvement of 2^k(k-1) over the best known bound. Moreover, we provide an explicit partially symmetric decomposition achieving this bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary of the Milnor fiber associated with a complex line arrangement is a three dimensional plumbed manifold, and it is a combinatorial invariant. We prove the reverse implication, which was conjectured N\'emethi and Szil\'ard. That is, this boundary of the Milnor fiber determines the combinatorics of the arrangement. Furthermore, we give an explicit method which constructs the poset associated with the arrangement, given a plumbing graph in normal form for the boundary.</description>

      <title>Categorifying isomonodromic deformations via Lie groupoids I: Logarithmic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We upgrade the classical operation of \textit{isomonodromic deformations} along a path $\gamma$ to a functor $\mathbb{P}_{\gamma}$ between categories of flat connections with logarithmic singularities along a divisor $D$, which itself depends functorially on $\gamma$, using tools from the theory of Lie groupoids. As applications, (1) we get that isomonodromy gives a map of moduli \textit{stacks} of flat connections with logarithmic singularities, (2) we encode higher homotopical information at level 2, i.e. we get an action of the fundamental 2-groupoid of the base of our family on the categories of logarithmic flat connections on the fibres, and (3) our methods produce a geometric incarnation of the isomonodromy functors as Morita equivalences which are more primary than the isomonodromy functors themselves, and from which they can be formally extracted by passing to representation categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of complex algebraic varieties, the decomposition theorem for semi-small maps provides a decomposition of the direct image of the constant sheaf. In this work, we develop a decomposition theorem for branched coverings of topological spaces. To achieve this, we start by constructing a decomposition theorem for unramified covering maps using transition functions. For a given branched covering of closed topological manifolds, we use the previous result to establish a decomposition of the direct image of the constant sheaf on the covering space. In the next step, we generalize our discussion to the case where the target space is not necessarily a topological manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.04832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the geometric Satake equivalence for mixed Tate motives over the integral motivic cohomology spectrum. This refines previous versions of the geometric Satake equivalence for split reductive groups. Our new geometric results include Whitney--Tate stratifications of Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannians and cellular decompositions of semi-infinite orbits. With future global applications in mind, we also achieve an equivalence relative to a power of the affine line. Finally, we use our equivalence to give Tannakian constructions of Deligne's modification of the dual group and a modified form of Vinberg's monoid over the integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an integer $n\geq 7$, we investigate the matroid realization space of a specific deformation of the regular $n$-gon along with its lines of symmetry. It turns out that this particular realization space is birational to the elliptic modular surface $\Xi_{1}(n)$ over the modular curve $X_{1}(n)$.
  In this way, we obtain a model of $\Xi_{1}(n)$ defined over the rational numbers. Furthermore, a natural geometric operator acts on these matroid realizations. On the elliptic modular surface, this operator corresponds to the multiplication by $-2$ on the elliptic curves. This provides a new geometric approach to computing multiplication by $-2$ on elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper further studies the matroid realization space of a specific deformation of the regular $n$-gon with its lines of symmetry. Recently, we obtained that these particular realization spaces are birational to the elliptic modular surfaces $\Xi_{1}(n)$ over the modular curve $X_1(n)$. Here, we focus on the peculiar cases when $n=7,8$ in more detail. We obtain concrete quartic surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ equipped with a dominant rational self-map stemming from an operator on line arrangements, which yields K3 surfaces with a dynamical system that is semi-conjugated to the plane.</description>

      <title>On the numerical Terao's conjecture and Ziegler pairs for line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a smallest possible counterexample to the Numerical Terao's Conjecture in the class of line arrangements in the complex projective plane. Our example consists of a pair of two arrangements with $13$ lines. Moreover, we use the newly discovered singular matroid realization spaces to construct new examples of pairs of line arrangements having the same underlying matroid but different free resolutions of the Milnor algebras. Such rare arrangements are called Ziegler pairs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Nonnegativity of signed Euler characteristics of moduli of curves and abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a perverse sheaf on the moduli stack of principally polarized abelian varieties or the moduli stack of smooth curves with n marked points over a field of characteristic zero, we prove that the (orbifold) Euler characteristic is nonnegative. For constant coefficients, this follows immediately from formulas of Harer-Zagier and Harder. Our proof is different and in the case of abelian varieties uses log Dubson-Kashiwara plus the fact that Hodge bundles are nef. For curves, we require an additional inequality established using Beilinson's gluing construction. The first main result is shown to be false in positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Chow theory of toric variety bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the Chow homology and cohomology of toric variety bundles, with no restrictions on the singularities of the fibre. We present the ordinary and equivariant homologies as modules over the cohomology of the base, identify the ordinary cohomology with homology-valued Minkowski weights, and identify the equivariant cohomology with cohomology-weighted piecewise polynomial functions. We describe the product structure on Minkowski weights via a fan displacement rule, and the non-equivariant limit via equivariant multiplicities. Along the way we establish relative analogues of the K\"unneth property and Kronecker duality. Applications include the balancing condition in logarithmic enumerative geometry.</description>

      <title>Singularities of character varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any complex reductive group $G$ and any compact Riemann surface with genus $g&gt;0$, we show that every connected component of the associated character variety is $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial and has symplectic singularities, and classify the connected components that admit symplectic resolutions. When $g&gt;1$, we use elliptic endoscopic groups to control the singularities caused by irreducible local systems with automorphism groups larger than the centre of $G$; when $g=1$, our analysis is based on some results of Borel-Friedman-Morgan. The main results for $g&gt;1$ were obtained by Herbig-Schwarz-Seaton via a different approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Galois rational maps between smooth projective varieties with trivial canonical bundle, with a particular interest in the case where the codomain is Hyper-K\"ahler. We obtain results about the birational geometry and the Galois closure of rational maps between Calabi-Yau manifolds. We apply these general results to a number of well-known examples.</description>

      <title>Algebraic magnetism invariants of a double scalar action on the projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This document is an expanded version of the notes from a talk at the \textit{Arithmetic and Algebraic Geometry Week} conference, which took place in Iasi in September 2025. In this note, we compute the pure magnets (certain semigroups) and the associated attractors for a double scalar action of $\mathbb{G}_m^2$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$. This is mostly expository and provides a non-affine example illustrating the invariants of Algebraic Magnetism in a simple and visual case. Nevertheless, we introduce the notion of lambdafiable magnets, in the general setting, to relate certain magnets to cocharacters. Finally we announce recent advanced results on Algebraic Magnetism obtained in \cite{BM} and solving positively some conjectures stated in \cite{Ma}.</description>

      <title>Milnor number of an invariant singularity: generalization of Chulkov's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17453v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: S.P. Chulkov has proven that the Milnor number of a function germ $f$ with zero 2-jet invariant with respect to a nontrivial action of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is at least $p-1$ for prime $p$. In this paper we prove a generalization of this inequality for actions of arbitrary abelian groups using M. Roberts' results on invariant morsifications for invariants of real group actions.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for string algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2004.11399v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a moment map picture for holomorphic string algebroids where the Hamiltonian gauge action is described by means of inner automorphisms of Courant algebroids. The zero locus of our moment map is given by the solutions of the Calabi system, a coupled system of equations which provides a unifying framework for the classical Calabi problem and the Hull-Strominger system. Our main results are concerned with the geometry of the moduli space of solutions, and assume a technical condition which is fulfilled in examples. We prove that the moduli space carries a pseudo-K\"ahler metric with K\"ahler potential given by the dilaton functional, a topological formula for the metric, and an infinitesimal Donaldson-Uhlenbeck-Yau type theorem.</description>

      <title>B-brane transport in nonabelian GLSMs for $K_{Gr(2,N)}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of B-branes in a class of nonabelian GLSMs realizing the canonical line bundle $K_{Gr(2,N)}$ in their geometric phase. By analysing the hemisphere partition function, i.e. B-brane central charge, we propose a grade restriction rule and the corresponding window categories for a specific class of paths between phases. We find very striking differences between the cases of N even and N odd. In particular, for the case of N even, we suggest that more than one window category can be possible, for a fixed path. A detailed computation of the open Witten index and some monodromies provides evidence for our proposal for window categories. In addition, we make some remarks about B-branes on the the strongly coupled phase, for the case $N=4$, based on our window proposal.</description>

      <title>On the resolvent degree of PSU(3,q)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolvent degree ($\operatorname{RD}$) is an invariant of finite groups in terms of the complexity of their algebraic actions. We address the problem of bounding $\operatorname{RD}(G)$ for all finite simple groups using the methods established by G\'{o}mez-Gonz\'{a}les-Sutherland-Wolfson in terms of $\operatorname{RD}^{\leq d}_{\mathbb{C}}$-versality and special points. We give upper bounds on $\operatorname{RD}(\operatorname{PSU}(3,q))$ and $\operatorname{RD}(\operatorname{PSU}(2, q))$ in terms of classical invariant theory. In the $\operatorname{PSU}(3,q)$ case, stability of low-degree invariants permit an asymptotic bound on $\operatorname{RD}$ growing in $q$.</description>

      <title>Resolutions of Type $\mathbb{A}$ Quantum Surface Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $B = \Bbbk_q[u,v]^{C_{n+1}}$ be a Type $\mathbb{A}_n$ quantum Kleinian singularity, which is an example of a noncommutative surface singularity. This singularity is known to have a noncommutative quasi-crepant resolution $\Lambda$, which is an "algebraic" resolution of $B$. We construct a category $\mathcal{X}$ which serves as a "geometric" resolution of $B$ by adapting techniques from quiver GIT and show that $\mathcal{X}$ and $\text{mod-}\Lambda$ are derived equivalent. Furthermore, we show that the intersection arrangement of lines in the exceptional locus of $\mathcal{X}$ corresponds to a Type $\mathbb{A}_n$ Dynkin diagram. This generalises the geometric McKay correspondence for classical Kleinian singularities.</description>

      <title>Rational Hodge--Tate prismatic crystals of quasi-l.c.i algebras and non-abelian $p$-adic Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a bounded prism $(A,I)$ and a bounded quasi-l.c.i algebra $R$ over $\overline{A}$. In this paper, for any prism $S/A$ with a surjection $S\to R$ such that $\widehat{\mathbb L}_{\overline{S}/\overline{A}}$ is a $p$-completely flat module over $\overline{S}$, we establish an equivalence of categories between rational Hodge-Tate crystals on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$ and topologically nilpotent integrable connections on the Hodge--Tate cohomology ring $\overline{\Delta}_{R/S}$. As an application, for a non-zero divisor $a\in \overline{A}$, we introduce the concept of $a$-smallness for a rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystal on $(R/A)_{\Delta}$. Finally, we focus on some special algebras $R$ over $\mathcal O_{\mathbb C_p}$ (or generally, the ring of integers of an algebraic closed and complete non-archimedean field) including all $p$-completely smooth algebras, $p$-complete algebras with semi-stable reductions and geometric valuation rings. By using our equivalence, we analyze the restriction functor from the category of $a$-small rational Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals to the category of $v$-vector bundles. This yields some new results in $p$-adic non-abelian Hodge Theory.</description>
