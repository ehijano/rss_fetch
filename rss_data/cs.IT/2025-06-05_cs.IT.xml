      <title>Multishot Capacity of Networks with Restricted Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate adversarial network coding and decoding, focusing on the multishot regime and when the adversary is restricted to operate on a vulnerable region of the network. Errors can occur on a proper subset of the network edges and are modeled via an adversarial channel. The paper contains both bounds and capacity-achieving schemes for the Diamond Network, the Mirrored Diamond Network, and generalizations of these networks. We also initiate the study of the capacity of 3-level networks in the multishot setting by computing the multishot capacity of the Butterfly Network, considered in [IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 69, no. 6, 2023], which is a variant of the network introduced by Ahlswede, Cai, Li and Yeung in 2000.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distribution Release of Gaussian Mixture Models via KL-Divergence Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are widely used statistical models for representing multi-modal data distributions, with numerous applications in data mining, pattern recognition, data simulation, and machine learning. However, recent research has shown that releasing GMM parameters poses significant privacy risks, potentially exposing sensitive information about the underlying data. In this paper, we address the challenge of releasing GMM parameters while ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Specifically, we focus on the privacy protection of mixture weights, component means, and covariance matrices. We propose to use Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a utility metric to assess the accuracy of the released GMM, as it captures the joint impact of noise perturbation on all the model parameters. To achieve privacy, we introduce a DP mechanism that adds carefully calibrated random perturbations to the GMM parameters. Through theoretical analysis, we quantify the effects of privacy budget allocation and perturbation statistics on the DP guarantee, and derive a tractable expression for evaluating KL divergence. We formulate and solve an optimization problem to minimize the KL divergence between the released and original models, subject to a given $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP constraint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high utility.</description>

      <title>Beamforming for Secure RSMA-Aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the physical layer security of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems. The ISAC base station (BS) transmits signals to communicate with users in an eavesdropped scenario and to estimate the parameters of the sensed targets. The research considers different sensing signals under RSMA technology and the Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound of the parameter estimation is utilized as the sensing metric. With the channel state information (CSI) of eavesdroppers known, the transmitting beam of the BS is optimized to maximize the energy efficiency in terms of the minimum user rate and secrecy capacity, considering the fairness among users and ensuring the sensing performance and communication security. With the CSI of eavesdroppers unknown, the transmitting beam of the BS is designed to minimize the energy consumption for sensing and communication, and the residual power is utilized for artificial noise, which is isotropically emitted to achieve interference with potential eavesdroppers. To solve the non-convex problems, three iterative algorithms based on successive convex approximation and penalty function are proposed. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>On irredundant orthogonal arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orthogonal array (OA), denoted by $\text{OA}(M, n, q, t)$, is an $M \times n$ matrix over an alphabet of size $q$ such that every selection of $t$ columns contains each possible $t$-tuple exactly $\lambda=M / q^t$ times. An irredundant orthogonal array (IrOA) is an OA with the additional property that, in any selection of $n - t$ columns, all resulting rows are distinct. IrOAs were first introduced by Goyeneche and \.{Z}yczkowski in 2014 to construct $t$-uniform quantum states without redundant information. Beyond their quantum applications, we focus on IrOAs as a combinatorial and coding theory problem. An OA is an IrOA if and only if its minimum Hamming distance is at least $t + 1$. Using this characterization, we demonstrate that for any linear code, either the code itself or its Euclidean dual forms a linear IrOA, giving a huge source of IrOAs. In the special case of self-dual codes, both the code and its dual yield IrOAs. Moreover, we construct new families of linear IrOAs based on self-dual, Maximum Distance Separable (MDS), and MDS-self-dual codes. Finally, we establish bounds on the minimum distance and covering radius of IrOAs.</description>

      <title>Control Signaling for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: How Many Bits are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can greatly improve the signal quality of future communication systems by reflecting transmitted signals toward the receiver. However, even when the base station (BS) has perfect channel knowledge and can compute the optimal RIS phase-shift configuration, implementing this configuration requires feedback signaling over a control channel from the BS to the RIS. This feedback must be kept minimal, as it is transmitted wirelessly every time the channel changes. In this paper, we examine how the feedback load, measured in bits, affects the performance of an RIS-aided system. Specifically, we investigate the trade-offs between codebook-based and element-wise feedback schemes, and how these influence the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We propose a novel quantization codebook tailored for line-of-sight (LoS) that guarantees a minimal SNR loss using a number of feedback bits that scale logarithmically with the number of RIS elements. We demonstrate the codebook's usefulness over Rician fading channels and how to extend it to handle a non-zero static path. Numerical simulations and analytical analysis are performed to quantify the performance degradation that results from a reduced feedback load, shedding light on how efficiently RIS configurations can be fed back in practical systems.</description>

      <title>Stable recovery of complex dictionary-sparse signals from phaseless measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dictionary-sparse phase retrieval, which is also known as phase retrieval with redundant dictionary, aims to reconstruct an original dictionary-sparse signal from its measurements without phase information. It is proved that if the measurement matrix $A$ satisfies null space property (NSP)/strong dictionary restricted isometry property (S-DRIP), then the dictionary-sparse signal can be exactly/stably recovered from its magnitude-only measurements up to a global phase. However, the S-DRIP holds only for real signals. Hence, in this paper, we mainly study the stability of the $\ell_1$-analysis minimization and its generalized $\ell_q\;(0&lt;q\leq1)$-analysis minimization for the recovery of complex dictionary-sparse signals from phaseless measurements. First, we introduce a new $l_1$-dictionary restricted isometry property ($\ell_1$-DRIP) for rank-one and dictionary-sparse matrices, and show that complex dictionary-sparse signals can be stably recovered by magnitude-only measurements via $\ell_1$-analysis minimization provided that the quadratic measurement map $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies $\ell_1$-DRIP. Then, we generalized the $\ell_1$-DRIP condition under the framework of $\ell_q\;(0&lt;q\leq1)$-analysis minimization.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations for Sequential Tests of Statistical Sequence Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of statistical sequence matching initiated by Unnikrishnan (TIT 2015) and derive theoretical performance guarantees for sequential tests that have bounded expected stopping times. Specifically, in this problem, one is given two databases of sequences and the task is to identify all matched pairs of sequences. In each database, each sequence is generated i.i.d. from a distinct distribution and a pair of sequences is said matched if they are generated from the same distribution. The generating distribution of each sequence is \emph{unknown}. We first consider the case where the number of matches is known and derive the exact exponential decay rate of the mismatch (error) probability, a.k.a. the mismatch exponent, under each hypothesis for optimal sequential tests. Our results reveal the benefit of sequentiality by showing that optimal sequential tests have larger mismatch exponent than fixed-length tests by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024). Subsequently, we generalize our achievability result to the case of unknown number of matches. In this case, two additional error probabilities arise: false alarm and false reject probabilities. We propose a corresponding sequential test, show that the test has bounded expected stopping time under certain conditions, and characterize the tradeoff among the exponential decay rates of three error probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the benefit of sequentiality over the two-step fixed-length test by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024) and propose an one-step fixed-length test that has no worse performance than the fixed-length test by Zhou \emph{et al.} (TIT 2024). When specialized to the case where either database contains a single sequence, our results specialize to large deviations of sequential tests for statistical classification, the binary case of which was recently studied by Hsu, Li and Wang (ITW 2022).</description>

      <title>On the Synthetic Channels in Polar Codes over Binary-Input Discrete Memoryless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar codes introduced by Arikan in 2009 are the first code family achieving the capacity of binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BIDMCs) with low-complexity encoding and decoding. Identifying unreliable synthetic channels in polar code construction is crucial. Currently, because of the large size of the output alphabets of synthetic channels, there is no effective approach to evaluate their reliability, except in the case that the underlying channels are binary erasure channels. This paper defines equivalence and symmetry based on the likelihood ratio profile of BIDMCs and characterizes symmetric BIDMCs as random switching channels (RSCs) of binary symmetric channels. By converting the generation of synthetic channels in polar code construction into algebraic operations on underlying channels, some compact representations of RSCs for these synthetic channels are derived. Moreover, a lower bound for the average number of elements that possess the same likelihood ratio within the output alphabet of any synthetic channel generated in polar codes is also derived.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Wireless Semantic Communication with Large AI Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 6G wireless systems are expected to support massive volumes of data with ultra-low latency. However, conventional bit-level transmission strategies cannot support the efficiency and adaptability required by modern, data-intensive applications. The concept of semantic communication (SemCom) addresses this limitation by focusing on transmitting task-relevant semantic information instead of raw data. While recent efforts incorporating deep learning and large-scale AI models have improved SemCom's performance, existing systems remain vulnerable to both semantic-level and transmission-level noise because they often rely on domain-specific architectures that hinder generalizability. In this paper, a novel and generalized semantic communication framework called WaSeCom is proposed to systematically address uncertainty and enhance robustness. In particular, Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization is employed to provide resilience against semantic misinterpretation and channel perturbations. A rigorous theoretical analysis is performed to establish the robust generalization guarantees of the proposed framework. Experimental results on image and text transmission demonstrate that WaSeCom achieves improved robustness under noise and adversarial perturbations. These results highlight its effectiveness in preserving semantic fidelity across varying wireless conditions.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learning has emerged as a transformative approach for modeling complex relationships across diverse domains, yet its potential in wireless security remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based graph neural network that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex radio frequency environments with varying sampling densities and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

      <title>Relay Selection and User Equipment Admission in Resource-Efficient NextG Sidelink Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 5G/6G sidelink communications addresses the challenge of connecting outer UEs, which are unable to directly access a base station (gNodeB), through inner UEs that act as relays to connect to the gNodeB. The key performance indicators include the achievable rates, the number of outer UEs that can connect to a gNodeB, and the latency experienced by outer UEs in establishing connections. We consider problem of determining the assignment of outer UEs to inner UEs based on the channel, interference, and traffic characteristics. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize a weighted sum rate of UEs, where weights can represent priority, waiting time, and queue length. This optimization accommodates constraints related to channel and interference characteristics that influence the rates at which links can successfully carry assigned traffic. While an exhaustive search can establish an upper bound on achievable rates by this non-convex optimization problem, it becomes impractical for larger number of outer UEs due to scalability issues related to high computational complexity. To address this, we present a greedy algorithm that incrementally selects links to maximize the sum rate, considering already activated links. This algorithm, although effective in achieving high sum rates, may inadvertently overlook some UEs, raising concerns about fairness. To mitigate this, we introduce a fairness-oriented algorithm that adjusts weights based on waiting time or queue length, ensuring that UEs with initially favorable conditions do not unduly disadvantage others over time. We show that this strategy not only improves the average admission ratio of UEs but also ensures a more equitable distribution of service among them, thereby providing a balanced and fair solution to sidelink communications.</description>

      <title>Flagged Extensions and Numerical Simulations for Quantum Channel Capacity: Bridging Theory and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I will investigate the capacities of noisy quantum channels through a combined analytical and numerical approach. First, I introduce novel flagged extension techniques that embed a channel into a higher-dimensional space, enabling single-letter upper bounds on quantum and private capacities. My results refine previous bounds and clarify noise thresholds beyond which quantum transmission vanishes. Second, I present a simulation framework that uses coherent information to estimate channel capacities in practice, focusing on two canonical examples: the amplitude damping channel (which we confirm is degradable and thus single-letter) and the depolarizing channel (whose capacity requires multi-letter superadditivity). By parameterizing input qubit states on the Bloch sphere, I numerically pinpoint the maximum coherent information for each channel and validate the flagged extension bounds. Notably, I capture the abrupt transition to zero capacity at high noise and observe superadditivity for moderate noise levels.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Graph Signal Processing Framework for Multiple Hypothesis Testing over Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the multiple hypothesis testing (MHT) problem over the joint domain formed by a graph and a measure space. On each sample point of this joint domain, we assign a hypothesis test and a corresponding $p$-value. The goal is to make decisions for all hypotheses simultaneously, using all available $p$-values. In practice, this problem resembles the detection problem over a sensor network during a period of time. To solve this problem, we extend the traditional two-groups model such that the prior probability of the null hypothesis and the alternative distribution of $p$-values can be inhomogeneous over the joint domain. We model the inhomogeneity via a generalized graph signal. This more flexible statistical model yields a more powerful detection strategy by leveraging the information from the joint domain.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Resource Allocation for Delay Optimization in RIS-Assisted OFDM Systems: A DRL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Testing (Conditional) Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sample complexity of mutual information and conditional mutual information testing. For conditional mutual information testing, given access to independent samples of a triple of random variables $(A, B, C)$ with unknown distribution, we want to distinguish between two cases: (i) $A$ and $C$ are conditionally independent, i.e., $I(A\!:\!C|B) = 0$, and (ii) $A$ and $C$ are conditionally dependent, i.e., $I(A\!:\!C|B) \geq \varepsilon$ for some threshold $\varepsilon$. We establish an upper bound on the number of samples required to distinguish between the two cases with high confidence, as a function of $\varepsilon$ and the three alphabet sizes. We conjecture that our bound is tight and show that this is indeed the case in several parameter regimes. For the special case of mutual information testing (when $B$ is trivial), we establish the necessary and sufficient number of samples required up to polylogarithmic terms.
  Our technical contributions include a novel method to efficiently simulate weakly correlated samples from the conditionally independent distribution $P_{A|B} P_{C|B} P_B$ given access to samples from an unknown distribution $P_{ABC}$, and a new estimator for equivalence testing that can handle such correlated samples, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of phase retrieval from offset linear canonical transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical phase retrieval refers to the recovery of an unknown signal from its Fourier magnitudes, which is widely used in fields such as quantum mechanics, signal processing, optics, etc. The offset linear canonical transform (OLCT), which is a more general type of linear integral transform including Fourier transform (FT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and linear canonical transform (LCT) as its special cases. Hence, in this paper, we focus on the uniqueness problem of phase retrieval in the framework of OLCT. First, we prove that all the nontrivial ambiguities in continuous OLCT phase retrieval can be represented by convolution operators, and demonstrate that a continuous compactly supported signal can be uniquely determined up to a global phase from its multiple magnitude-only OLCT measurements. Moreover, we investigate the nontrivial ambiguities in the discrete OLCT phase retrieval case. Furthermore, we demenstrate that a nonseparable function can be uniquely recovered from its magnitudes of short-time OLCT (STOLCT) up to a global phase. Finally, we show that signals which are bandlimited in FT or OLCT domain can be reconstructed from its sampled STOLCT magnitude measurements, up to a global phase, providing the ambiguity function of window function satisfies some mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Curse of Slicing: Why Sliced Mutual Information is a Deceptive Measure of Statistical Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Mutual Information (SMI) is widely used as a scalable alternative to mutual information for measuring non-linear statistical dependence. Despite its advantages, such as faster convergence, robustness to high dimensionality, and nullification only under statistical independence, we demonstrate that SMI is highly susceptible to data manipulation and exhibits counterintuitive behavior. Through extensive benchmarking and theoretical analysis, we show that SMI saturates easily, fails to detect increases in statistical dependence (even under linear transformations designed to enhance the extraction of information), prioritizes redundancy over informative content, and in some cases, performs worse than simpler dependence measures like the correlation coefficient.</description>

      <title>Generalized GM-MDS: Polynomial Codes are Higher Order MDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12888v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GM-MDS theorem, conjectured by Dau-Song-Dong-Yuen and proved by Lovett and Yildiz-Hassibi, shows that the generator matrices of Reed-Solomon codes can attain every possible configuration of zeros for an MDS code. The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length.
  A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any polynomial code, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.</description>

      <title>AG Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity over Constant-sized Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently-emerging field of higher order MDS codes has sought to unify a number of concepts in coding theory. Such areas captured by higher order MDS codes include maximally recoverable (MR) tensor codes, codes with optimal list-decoding guarantees, and codes with constrained generator matrices (as in the GM-MDS theorem).
  By proving these equivalences, Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam showed the existence of optimally list-decodable Reed-Solomon codes over exponential sized fields. Building on this, recent breakthroughs by Guo-Zhang and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li have shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity (which is a relaxation of optimal list-decodability) over linear size fields. We extend these works by developing a formal theory of relaxed higher order MDS codes. In particular, we show that there are two inequivalent relaxations which we call lower and upper relaxations. The lower relaxation is equivalent to relaxed optimal list-decodable codes and the upper relaxation is equivalent to relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column.
  We then generalize the techniques of GZ and AGL to show that both these relaxations can be constructed over constant size fields by randomly puncturing suitable algebraic-geometric codes. For this, we crucially use the generalized GM-MDS theorem for polynomial codes recently proved by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi. We obtain the following corollaries from our main result. First, randomly punctured AG codes of rate $R$ achieve list-decoding capacity with list size $O(1/\epsilon)$ and field size $\exp(O(1/\epsilon^2))$. Prior to this work, AG codes were not even known to achieve list-decoding capacity. Second, by randomly puncturing AG codes, we can construct relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column over constant-sized fields, whereas (non-relaxed) MR tensor codes require exponential field size.</description>

      <title>Statistical Channel Based Low-Complexity Rotation and Position Optimization for 6D Movable Antennas Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA) is a promising technology to fully exploit spatial variation in wireless channels by allowing flexible adjustment of three-dimensional (3D) positions and rotations of antennas at the transceiver. In this paper, we investigate the practical low-complexity design of 6DMA-enabled communication systems, including transmission protocol, statistical channel information (SCI) acquisition, and joint position and rotation optimization of 6DMA surfaces based on the SCI of users. Specifically, an orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)-based algorithm is proposed for the estimation of SCI of users at all possible position-rotation pairs of 6DMA surfaces based on the channel measurements at a small subset of position-rotation pairs. Then, the average sum logarithmic rate of all users is maximized by jointly designing the positions and rotations of 6DMA surfaces based on their SCI acquired. Different from prior works on 6DMA which adopt alternating optimization to design 6DMA positions/rotations with iterations, we propose a new sequential optimization approach that first determines 6DMA rotations and then finds their feasible positions to realize the optimized rotations subject to practical antenna placement constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed sequential optimization significantly reduces the computational complexity of conventional alternating optimization, while achieving comparable communication performance. It is also shown that the proposed SCI-based 6DMA design can effectively enhance the communication throughput of wireless networks over existing fixed (position and rotation) antenna arrays, yet with a practically appealing low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.</description>

Abstract: We comprehensively study weighted projective Reed-Muller (WPRM) codes on weighted projective planes $\mathbb{P}(1,a,b)$. We provide the universal Gr\"obner basis for the vanishing ideal of the set $Y$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$--rational points of $\mathbb{P}(1,a,b)$ to get the dimension of the code. We determine the regularity set of $Y$ using a novel combinatorial approach. We employ footprint techniques to compute the minimum distance.</description>

      <title>ZipNN: Lossless Compression for AI Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growth of model sizes and the scale of their deployment, their sheer size burdens the infrastructure requiring more network and more storage to accommodate these. While there is a vast model compression literature deleting parts of the model weights for faster inference, we investigate a more traditional type of compression - one that represents the model in a compact form and is coupled with a decompression algorithm that returns it to its original form and size - namely lossless compression.
  We present ZipNN a lossless compression tailored to neural networks. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that specific lossless compression can gain significant network and storage reduction on popular models, often saving 33% and at times reducing over 50% of the model size. We investigate the source of model compressibility and introduce specialized compression variants tailored for models that further increase the effectiveness of compression. On popular models (e.g. Llama 3) ZipNN shows space savings that are over 17% better than vanilla compression while also improving compression and decompression speeds by 62%. We estimate that these methods could save over an ExaByte per month of network traffic downloaded from a large model hub like Hugging Face.</description>

      <title>Generalization in Federated Learning: A Conditional Mutual Information Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted privacy-preserving distributed learning framework, yet its generalization performance remains less explored compared to centralized learning. In FL, the generalization error consists of two components: the out-of-sample gap, which measures the gap between the empirical and true risk for participating clients, and the participation gap, which quantifies the risk difference between participating and non-participating clients. In this work, we apply an information-theoretic analysis via the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework to study FL's two-level generalization. Beyond the traditional supersample-based CMI framework, we introduce a superclient construction to accommodate the two-level generalization setting in FL. We derive multiple CMI-based bounds, including hypothesis-based CMI bounds, illustrating how privacy constraints in FL can imply generalization guarantees. Furthermore, we propose fast-rate evaluated CMI bounds that recover the best-known convergence rate for two-level FL generalization in the small empirical risk regime. For specific FL model aggregation strategies and structured loss functions, we refine our bounds to achieve improved convergence rates with respect to the number of participating clients. Empirical evaluations confirm that our evaluated CMI bounds are non-vacuous and accurately capture the generalization behavior of FL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Refining Labeling Functions with Limited Labeled Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Programmatic weak supervision (PWS) significantly reduces human effort for labeling data by combining the outputs of user-provided labeling functions (LFs) on unlabeled datapoints. However, the quality of the generated labels depends directly on the accuracy of the LFs. In this work, we study the problem of fixing LFs based on a small set of labeled examples. Towards this goal, we develop novel techniques for repairing a set of LFs by minimally changing their results on the labeled examples such that the fixed LFs ensure that (i) there is sufficient evidence for the correct label of each labeled datapoint and (ii) the accuracy of each repaired LF is sufficiently high. We model LFs as conditional rules which enables us to refine them, i.e., to selectively change their output for some inputs. We demonstrate experimentally that our system improves the quality of LFs based on surprisingly small sets of labeled datapoints.</description>
