      <title>Moat hyperons in cold neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperonic equation of state within the non-linear derivative model that incorporates a momentum dependence on the interactions, with a special emphasis on properly establishing the conditions for hyperon appearance in neutron star matter. We demonstrate that hyperons can appear at finite momentum, forming a so-called ``moat" region, even when they are absent at lower momenta. Our study shows that this phenomenon significantly alters the composition and equation of state of hyperonic matter as compared to the cases when it is disregarded, highlighting the importance of accurately treating the momentum dependence of the baryon fields in dense matter.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Amplification for Muon-to-Positron Conversion in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the lepton-number and lepton-flavour-violating process of muon-to-positron conversion $\mu^- + N \rightarrow e^+ + N'$, in the presence of an ultralight scalar dark matter (ULSDM) field which couples to neutrinos. The ULSDM contributes to the effective off-diagonal Majorana mass $ m_{\mu e}$, therefore amplifying the rate of muon-to-positron conversion to experimentally observable levels. Using existing bounds from SINDRUM II, COMET, and Mu2e experiments, we derive constraints on the flavour-off-diagonal couplings of neutrinos to ULSDM for the first time. Our work reveals that upcoming experiments can provide stronger sensitivity to these new couplings than bounds arising from cosmological surveys and terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral Cherenkov radiation at time-dependent chiral chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the photon production process $f\to f+\gamma$ in the presence of a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5$. Using the ultra-relativistic approximation, we demonstrate validity of the adiabatic approximation. Analytical expressions for the photon spectrum are derived for two models of the chiral magnetic conductivity $b_0\propto \mu_5$: (i) $b_0(t)= A_1+B_1\tanh(t/\tau)$ and (ii) $b_0(t)= A_2(t/\tau)/(1+t^2/\tau^2)$. It is known that for constant $b_0$, photon emission may exhibit a resonance for one photon polarization depending on the sign of $b_0$. We show that in model (i), up to two resonances may occur, depending on the sign of the asymptotic values $b_0(\infty)$ and $b_0(-\infty)$. No resonances are observed in model (ii). Numerical calculations are performed using parameters relevant to quark-gluon plasma, and we discuss the universality of the results.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Analysis of Transverse Momentum Spectra in Pb-Pb Collisions at 2.76 TeV: Centrality Dependence of Temperature, Freezeout Parameters and Non-Extensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of Pb-Pb collisions at 2.76 TeV in mid-rapidity, $|y|&lt;0.5$, based on data by the ALICE Collaboration. In particular, we examine the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of positively charged (identified) hadrons, $\pi^+$, $K^+$ and $p$, generated in various centrality intervals. We perform individual fits using the thermodynamically consistent Tsallis distribution to extract the following quantities: the non-extensitivity parameter, $q$, the effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff}$, the kinetic freezeout volume, $V$, the mean transverse flow velocity, $\beta_T$, the mean kinetic freezeout temperature, $\langle T_0\rangle$, the thermal temperature, $T_{\rm th}$, and the parameter $\zeta$, which characterizes the fluctuating number of generated particles. From peripheral to central collision, and from lower to higher charged particle multiplicity per pseudorapidity unit, $\langle dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta \rangle$, all these quantities are observed to increase, with the exception of $q$, which has the opposite behavior. The parameters $T_{\rm eff}$, $q$, and $V$ depend on the hadron mass in a way that supports the scenarios of volume differential freezeout and multiple kinetic freezeout. Furthermore, we extracted $\langle T_{\rm eff}\rangle$ and $\langle q\rangle$ for different collisions and energies at LHC and RHIC, and compare their dependencies on $\langle dN_{\rm ch}/d\eta \rangle$ and $\langle N_{\rm part} \rangle$.</description>

      <title>New Isobar Models for $K^+\Lambda$ Electroproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electroproduction of kaon on proton has been studied using two covariant isobar models. The models incorporate propagators and vertex factors developed in our previous works. In total, the current study includes 26 nucleon resonances and 20 hyperon resonances, with spins up to 13/2. In the electromagnetic vertices, we consider two alternative electromagnetic form factors alongside the commonly used dipole model. The unknown parameters in the models, such as longitudinal coupling constants and form factor cutoffs, are determined by fitting the calculated observables to nearly 2000 experimental data points. The resulting models demonstrate satisfactory consistency with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy of $DN$ and $\bar{D}N$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of the ALICE@LHC and STAR@RHIC experiments to reconstruct $D$ mesons has enabled femtoscopic correlation measurements of open-charm mesons in both small and large systems. In this work, we present a theoretical calculation of the correlation functions of $D$ and $\bar{D}$ mesons with nucleons, based on the Koonin-Pratt formalism applied to the systems produced in these high-energy collisions. We use an effective Lagrangian that models the interaction between charmed mesons and baryons. From the unitarized on-shell amplitudes, we extract the low-energy scattering parameters and compute the correlation functions using the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation. Additionally, we apply the TROY formalism to obtain the off-shell $T$-matrix in coupled channels and reconstruct the full wave function, which we incorporate into the Koonin-Pratt formula. We compare these two approaches and provide predictions for different correlated pairs, including the effects of the Coulomb interaction and thermal weights for the coupled channels. These results can be tested against current and future experimental data from ALICE and STAR collaborations in both proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Multiple rescattering effects in the hard knockout reaction $\mathbf{^2\mbox{H}(p,2p)n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of a proton with a deuteron is the simplest nuclear reaction. However, it allows the study of precursors of nuclear medium effects such as initial-state/final-state interactions (ISI/FSI). In case of hard proton knockout, the deviation of ISI/FSI from the 'standard' values may carry a signal of color transparency. In this regard, it is important to define the 'standard' as precisely as possible. This work continues previous studies within the framework of the Generalized Eikonal Approximation (GEA). The focus is on processes where the participating protons experience multiple soft rescattering on the spectator neutron. It is shown that correct treatment of deviations of the trajectories of outgoing protons from the longitudinal direction leads to a significant modification of partial amplitudes with soft rescattering of two outgoing protons and non-vanishing amplitudes with rescattering of incoming and outgoing protons. The new treatment of multiple rescattering is important in kinematics with a forward spectator neutron.</description>

      <title>Global $\Lambda$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD), the global $\Lambda$ polarization ($P_\Lambda$) is calculated in Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 9 GeV, in which high baryon density is achieved. Various contributions to $P_\Lambda$ are considered: those from the thermal vorticity, meson field, thermal shear and spin-Hall effect. Feed-down from higher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared with available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of the energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\Lambda$ is performed. The results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data. While the results at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be considered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR fixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is predicted that a broad maximum of $P_\Lambda$ is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the centrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the meson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\Lambda$ is also studied.</description>

      <title>Robust extrapolation using physics-related activation functions in neural networks for nuclear masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the importance of nuclear mass predictions, numerous models have been developed to extrapolate the measured data into unknown regions. While neural networks -- the core of modern artificial intelligence -- have been recently suggested as powerful methods, showcasing high predictive power in the measured region, their ability to extrapolate remains questionable. This limitation stems from their `black box' nature and large number of parameters entangled with nonlinear functions designed in the context of computer science. In this study, we demonstrate that replacing such nonlinear functions with physics-related functions significantly improves extrapolation performance and provides enhanced understanding of the model mechanism. Using only the information about neutron (N) and proton (Z) numbers without any existing global mass models or knowledge of magic numbers, we developed a highly accurate model that covers light nuclei (N, Z &gt; 0) up to the drip lines. The extrapolation performance was rigorously evaluated using the outermost nuclei in the measurement landscape, and only the data in the inner region was used for training. We present details of the method and model, along with opportunities for future improvements.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-State Independent Relations in Rapidly Rotating Hybrid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 22 hadronic and 100 hybrid equations of state (EoSs) that allow for heavy baryons and deconfined quark matter at high densities, aiming to establish quasi-universal relations for both slowly and rapidly rotating neutron stars. All EoSs are consistent with current observational constraints, including NICER and GW170817. Our results confirm that the I-Love-Q and I-C-Q relations remain approximately EoS-insensitive across this broad EoS set, with deviations typically within 10\% for hadronic stars and up to 20\% for those with complex core compositions. These relations are extended to include low-mass neutron stars such as HESS J1731-347, and to stars with general core compositions--nucleonic, hyperonic (full baryon octet), and quark matter. The analysis underscores both the robustness and the limitations of universal relations when applied to compact stars with exotic degrees of freedom and rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>Giving wake to energy-energy correlators: Hydrodynamic response on the celestial sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observation of the medium response generated by the propagation of high energy partons in the quark gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions would provide a clear and unmistakable evidence for the hydrodynamic behavior of the bulk. Recently, it has been argued that the features of the medium's back-reaction to the jet could be cleanly imprinted in the correlations of asymptotic energy flows, in principle allowing to isolate this signal from other uncorrelated physical processes. Nonetheless, the current limited theoretical understanding of these jet observables in heavy-ion collisions constrains their applicability as probes of the medium (hydro)dynamics. In this work, we provide an analytic picture for the medium back-reaction's effect on the energy flux and two point energy correlator. We show that the medium response leads to the emergence of an universal classical scaling law, competing with the perturbative QCD contribution at large angles. Comparing the associated correlator to recent experimental measurements, we find that the observed large angle features can be qualitatively described by a purely hydrodynamically driven response and its interplay with the hard jet component.</description>
