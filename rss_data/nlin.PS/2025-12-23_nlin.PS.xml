      <title>Stability of nonlinear Dirac solitons under the action of external potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The instabilities observed in direct numerical simulations of the Gross-Neveu equation under linear and harmonic potentials are studied. The Lakoba algorithm, based on the method of characteristics, is performed to numerically obtain the two spinor components. We identify non-conservation of energy and charge in simulations with instabilities and we find that all studied solitons are numerically stable, except the low-frequency solitons oscillating in the harmonic potential over long periods of time. These instabilities, as in the case of Gross-Neveu equation without potential, can be removed by imposing absorbing boundary conditions. The dynamics of the soliton is in perfect agreement with the prediction obtained using an ansatz with only two collective coordinates, namely the position and momentum of the center of mass. We use the temporal variation of both field energy and momentum to determine the evolution equations satisfied by the collective coordinates. By applying the same methodology, we also demonstrate the spurious character of the reported instabilities in the Alexeeva-Barashenkov-Saxena model under external potentials.</description>

      <title>Localized wave solutions of three-component defocusing Kundu-Eckhaus equation with 4x4 matrix spectral problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on three-component defocusing Kundu-Eckhaus equation, which serves as a significant coupled model for describing complex wave propagation in nonlinear optical fibers. By employing binary Darboux transformation based on 4x4 matrix spectral problem, we derive vector dark soliton solutions, and meanwhile, the exact expressions of asymptotic dark soliton components are obtained through an asymptotic analysis method. Furthermore, breather and Y-shaped breather solutions, absent from single-component defocusing kundu-Eckhaus systems, are obtained due to the mutual coupling effects between different components. The results significantly advance our understanding nonlinear wave phenomenon induced by coupling effects and provide a theoretical reference for subsequent studies on defocusing multi-component systems.</description>

      <title>Quantized Frequency-locking and Extreme Transitions in a Ring of Phase Oscillators with Three-Body Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a spectrum of exotic frequency-locked states in a ring of phase oscillators with pure three-body interactions. For identical oscillators, the system hosts a vast multiplicity of stable quantized frequency-locked states without phase coherence. Introducing frequency heterogeneity broadens each quantized level into a continuous band and drives an extreme second-order transition at $\Delta_c$: below $\Delta_c$ the entire population locks to a collective phase velocity; above $\Delta_c$ a desynchronous state emerges, characterized by strongly localized bursts on a slowly varying background. This minimal model thus establishes a new paradigm for complex synchronization landscapes arising from higher-order interactions.</description>

      <title>Breather interactions and limit analysis in the second harmonic generation process via Riemann-Hilbert approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of second harmonic generation (SHG) heralds the emergence of nonlinear optics. In this paper, we focus on the theoretical analysis of the SHG equation under phase-matching conditions. A rich family of soliton solutions are derived via the Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach, and we characterize breather interactions corresponding to second harmonic solutions. The construction and solution of the RH problem are discussed firstly, including a detailed analysis of the discrete spectrum in the single-zero and double-zero cases. In such cases two-soliton solutions, breather solutions, two-breather solutions, and soliton-breather solutions are obtained. We numerically simulate and visually illustrate the spatiotemporal evolution of these solutions. Furthermore, through asymptotic analysis of the interaction dynamics, the exact position shift magnitudes resulting from breather-breather interaction within a nonzero background field are calculated. When the velocities are distinct, the interaction of two breathers divides the xt-plane into four asymptotic regions by the characteristic trajectories of breathers, and we show that the asymptotic behavior can be explicitly determined by the relative position between the region and the breathers.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted significant interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, thus being modeled via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often exhibit non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. Previous studies have shown that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while they are easier to observe when the interactions are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called mdirected hypergraphs, which we compare with their corresponding networks, and we observe that chimera state and specifically amplitude-mediated chimeras can emerge due to directionality, which had not been previously observed in the absence of directionality. We also compare the effect of non-reciprocal interactions between higher-order and pairwise couplings, and we find numerically that chimera states appear over a broader parameter range when considering higher-order interactions than in the corresponding network case, demonstrating the impact of directionality and the effect of higher-order interactions. Finally, the nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>
