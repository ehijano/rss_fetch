      <title>Non-vacuum black holes in new general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New general relativity (NGR) possesses a region in the \((c_{a},c_{v},c_{t})\)-parameter space corresponding to physically acceptable models. However, when solving the field equations for vacuum and non--vacuum static and spherically symmetric configurations under the assumption of the existence of a local black hole horizon, we find that the mere existence of such solutions imposes algebraic constraints that fix the parameters to values associated with known pathological models. As a consequence, we conclude that NGR is unable to describe physically meaningful non-trivial black holes.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spin Priors on the Population Inference of Merging Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spins of merging binary black holes (BBHs) inferred from gravitational-wave (GW) observations provide key insights into their formation channels. However, spin parameters are typically weakly constrained from data, and their inferred values are often strongly influenced by the assumed prior in Bayesian analyses. A commonly used prior, uniform in spin magnitudes and isotropic in spin directions, assigns vanishing probability density to spin-orbit-aligned configurations, potentially biasing inferences for BBH parameters. The prior choice can also affect population-level analyses by degrading the convergence of Monte Carlo integrations used to evaluate the likelihood in hierarchical Bayesian inference. In this work, we propose a novel spin prior that is uniform in the effective spin parameters Xeff and Xp, two spin combinations that can be relatively well measured from GW data, conditioned on the mass ratio. Using simulated BBH populations, we show that the inferred spin population can depend on the choice of prior, and that the proposed prior more accurately recovers the underlying spin population, particularly when the true distribution favors aligned-spin configurations. Because mass and spin measurements are correlated, our prior also enables a more accurate recovery of the underlying mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations and gravitational waves in the general Einstein-vector theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability and gravitational waves (GWs) in the four-dimensional general Einstein-vector theory in a cosmological background. The theory accommodates up to six propagating degrees of freedom, comprising two tensor, two vector, and two scalar modes, in addition to matter perturbations. In certain regions of the parameter space, the number of scalar degrees of freedom is reduced to one or even zero. To investigate the stability, we systematically analyze ghost, Laplacian, and tachyonic instabilities at the linear perturbative level. The stability conditions are easily satisfied for tensor perturbations, but impose nontrivial constraints on the parameter space for vector perturbations. Furthermore, in the presence of a nonvanishing background vector field, the scalar sector becomes unstable at small wavenumbers $|\vec{k}|$. In the small-scale limit ($|\vec{k}|\rightarrow\infty$), we further investigate the GW properties of the general Einstein-vector theory within the stable parameter space, including the number of independent modes, their propagation speeds, and observational constraints from GW experiments. We find that there are at most two tensor modes, two vector modes, and one scalar mode. Notably, vector GWs propagate superluminally, yet they are forbidden if tensor GWs travel exactly at light speed. This distinctive feature provides a key observational signature for testing the theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical system and statefinder analysis of cosmological models in f(T, B) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study systematically investigates the cosmological dynamics of two well-motivated functional forms in $f(T,B)$ gravity within a flat Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. Here $T$ denotes the torsion scalar and $B$ the boundary term, with the special choice $f(T,B) = - T + B$ recovering General Relativity. We focus on a multiplicative power-law model $f(T,B) = c_1 T^\alpha B^\beta$ and an additive mixed power-law model $f(T,B) = c_2 T^\alpha + c_3 B^\beta$. Using dynamical system techniques, we construct autonomous systems and identify de Sitter attractors that naturally explain late-time cosmic acceleration. Analytical stability conditions for these fixed points are derived, and numerical simulations reveal characteristic evolutionary patterns, such as spiral trajectories and damped oscillations in the additive mixed power-law model. Furthermore, statefinder diagnostics are applied to quantitatively distinguish these models from the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and other dark energy scenarios. The results indicate that $f(T,B)$ gravity offers a theoretically consistent and observationally distinguishable geometric framework for explaining cosmic acceleration, presenting a compelling alternative to conventional dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Statistics of time and frequency-averaged spectra in gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series analysis from gravitational-wave detectors often relies on the assumption that time chunks, or frequency bins, are uncorrelated. We discuss the validity of this approximation in the context of searches for stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds. We examine the impact of averaging over time and frequency, a reduction technique commonly employed to minimize the computational expense of likelihood evaluations. We introduce an analytical tool based on Fisher information to quantify the error in parameter inference arising from ignoring these effects. Finally, we address the issue of locally stationary processes and optimal time chunking.</description>

      <title>New Horizons in Effective Field Theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the most general parity symmetric effective scalar tensor theory in four dimensions containing terms up to fourth derivative order in the Lagrangian. It has been shown [H.S. Reall, Phys. Rev. D 103 (2021), 084027] that this theory has three polarizations generically goverened by different (nested) propagation cones, neither of which in general coincides with the lightcone as defined by the metric. Consequently, the notion of black hole horizon must be defined relative to the widest propagation cone, and not with respect to the metric. We provide two theorems stating that, nevertheless, the horizon of a \emph{stationary} black hole is null with respect to the metric, and that, in fact, all three propagation cones touch on the horizon. The conditions in these theorems allow for rotating black holes. Our theorems thereby suggest that the notion of Killing horizon, central in most discussions of black hole thermodynamics, retains its fundamental status, and that certain thermodynamic paradoxes associated with multiple propagation cones are evaded.</description>

      <title>Are black hole spins truly near-zero?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fourth gravitational-wave transient catalog, GWTC-4.0, reports 153 binary black hole mergers with false-alarm rates $&lt;1,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Chirp masses are typically measured well, with the smallest fractional uncertainty being $2%$ at the $90%$ credible level. Spins, on the other hand, are poorly constrained: the median of the best-measured spin component of the population, the effective spin, is $\chi_{\rm eff}=0.04$, with a typical $90%$ credible uncertainty of $\Delta\chi_{\rm eff}=0.44$. The large majority -- $90%$ of the observed black holes -- are consistent with spin magnitudes $\chi&lt;0.57$ and are weakly aligned with the orbits. At $90%$ credibility, the peaks of the inferred posteriors for spin magnitude are found to lie in the range $0.01$--$0.23$.
  We show that this ``near-zero spins'' conclusion may be prior-driven, and that uniform-in-magnitude spin priors lead to under-exploration of the moderate-to-high spin region of parameter space. Adopting a physically agnostic prior that is uniform in spin-vector configuration space (i.e., spin states uniform within a unit sphere) yields similar constraints on $\chi_{\rm eff}$, but substantially different spin-magnitude inferences than GWTC-4.0. The resulting shift in spins directly impacts tests of general relativity, constraints on near-extremal Kerr remnants, and astrophysical conclusions, including diagnostics of formation channels and hierarchical growth. In short, the data do not require vanishing spins -- the prior does, and accounting for this is essential for robust GR tests and population inferences.</description>

      <title>Scalar field coupled to boundary in non-metricity: a new avenue towards dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While conformal transformations in metric scalar-tensor theories recover General Relativity, this feature is notably absent in standard non-metricity-based theories. We demonstrate that by introducing the boundary term C, a non-metricity scalar-tensor theory can recover Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity (STEGR) in the Einstein frame. Motivated by this, we propose a novel gravity model where a scalar field couples nonminimally to both the non-metricity scalar Q and the boundary term C. We focus in the cosmological scenario where we present the covariant formulation and a unified autonomous system framework that treats generic affine-connection choices, including coincident and non-coincident gauges, on an equal footing. Our dynamical analysis across three connection branches reveals standard thermal histories and stable de Sitter attractors. These results show that boundary-term couplings provide a well-posed, geometrically flexible route to addressing late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Linear Perturbations under Time-Dependent Hubble Friction I: SR-USR-SR Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the linear perturbation (including the comoving curvature perturbation and field perturbation) dynamics in the SR-USR-SR inflation with instantaneous transitions. Using the junction method and asymptotic expansions of Hankel functions, we derive accurate asymptotic expressions for the time evolution of mode functions and the resulting power spectrum, based on three systematic rules for identifying the dominant terms across transitions. Our results reveal that a finite dip of the final power spectrum arises from the cancellation between two growing modes within the linear perturbation theory, rather than between constant and growing terms as previously suggested. We also provide analytical descriptions of the amplitude enhancement and oscillatory features in the linear power spectrum, in agreement with numerical computations. These simple, tractable formulas not only facilitate theoretical calculations but also yield testable predictions for future CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Origin of Unequal Mass Gravitational Wave Events: Insights from a Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalog of Gravitational Wave (GW) events is rapidly growing, providing key insights into the evolution of massive binaries and compact object formation. However, a key challenge is to explain the origin of exceptional events such as GW190814, among the most asymmetric mass-ratio mergers to date ($q\approx 0.1$). We show that it shares an evolutionary pathway with the most unequal mass Galactic High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) 4U 1700-37/ HD 153919. We demonstrate this unique connection by utilizing a rich set of existing observational constraints for the HMXB and compute detailed binary evolution models to explain its formation history. We find that conservative mass transfer, along with a directed natal kick are essential to explain its current state. We show that this system is unlikely to form a GW source due to a failed Common Envelope (CE) phase in the future, in agreement with previous work. With additional models, we show that a similar pathway naturally forms GW190814-like events, provided the first phase of mass transfer remains conservative, and the first-born (lower mass) compact object receives a large natal kick ($\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{km/s}$) for the subsequent CE phase to be successful and form a asymmetric mass-ratio GW source. Anchored by the number of analogous Galactic HMXBs, we estimate rates for such GW events, which broadly agree with their observed rate. Our work demonstrates a unified formation pathway for highly asymmetric mass-ratio HMXBs and GW events. Moreover, it highlights the critical role of finding and characterizing local analogs in different evolutionary phases, and using them as a bridge to understand the origin of GW sources, especially the outliers like GW190814.</description>

      <title>Magic and Wormholes in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any quantum state is fully specified by the expectation values of a complete set of Hermitian operators. For a system of Majorana fermions, such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, this set of observables can be taken to be all possible strings of Majorana fermion operators. The expectation values of these fermion strings in a thermal state depend erratically on the microscopic couplings that specify the SYK Hamiltonian, and we study their statistical properties directly in the thermodynamic limit using path integral techniques. When the underlying SYK Hamiltonian is chaotic, we find that these expectation values are well-modeled as real Gaussian random variables with zero mean and a variance that we compute. In contrast, for the integrable variant of SYK, we find that the expectation values are actually non-Gaussian. We then use these results to study measures of magic in the SYK thermal state, including the robustness of magic and the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. We also show that our results can be quantitatively reproduced with a dual gravity calculation in the chaotic case at sufficiently low temperature. In this dual gravity model the variance of a given microscopic operator string is related to a wormhole geometry stabilized by a massive particle which is dual to the operator string. Our results thus provide a concrete and quantitative setting in which to study the relationship between randomness, wormholes, and closed universes as well as a holographic dual of quantum magic.</description>

      <title>Lazarides-Shafi axion models as Dijkgraaf-Witten theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion models often face the domain wall problem, which threatens the standard big-bang cosmology. The Lazarides-Shafi mechanism attempts to resolve this by identifying degenerate vacua through a continuous gauge symmetry. We formulate a topological quantum field theory to isolate the essential structure of the mechanism and analyze its generalized symmetry structure, including higher-form symmetries and higher-group. This framework yields a master formula for computing the domain wall number and clarifies the higher-form symmetry conditions required for complete vacuum identification in a model independent way. Moreover, while a domain-wall-number-one scenario eliminates all higher-form global symmetries, the theory nevertheless exhibits a nontrivial four-group structure and realizes a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Polar-Cap Currents in Multipolar Pulsar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray pulse-profile modeling of millisecond pulsars offers a direct route to measuring neutron star masses and radii, thereby constraining the dense-matter equation of state. However, standard analyses typically rely on \emph{ad hoc} hotspot parameterizations rather than self-consistent physical models. While connecting surface heating directly to the magnetospheric geometry provides a more natural physical pathway, computing global magnetospheric solutions is too computationally expensive to perform on-the-fly during parameter inference. In this work, we bridge this gap by deriving fully analytic, first-principles expressions for surface return currents in mixed dipole--quadrupole magnetospheres. Working within force-free electrodynamics, we generalize the field-aligned current invariant $\Lambda$, the crucial scalar that maps the far-zone magnetic structure to the near-zone heating rate, from the standard dipole approximation to arbitrary quadrupolar configurations. We demonstrate that even when the quadrupole component is sub-dominant in the far zone (the mixing regime), using a dipole-based heating prescription fails to capture the significant enhancement or suppression of the return-current density on the polar cap. Our consistent quadrupole-aware framework reveals that these multipolar currents redistribute the surface heating, leading to systematic discrepancies in predicted pulse profiles that are amplified by atmosphere beaming and can reach $\sim 30\%$ near pulse peaks. These results provide a rigorous analytic foundation for mapping global magnetic geometry to surface heating in multipolar magnetospheres, enabling physically consistent inference beyond the idealized dipole approximation.</description>

      <title>Maximum capacity of Bartnik data and a generalization of static metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by R. Bartnik's mass minimization problem in general relativity, we investigate a dual problem of maximizing the capacity among asymptotically flat extensions (with nonnegative scalar curvature) of some fixed two-dimensional boundary data. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers on the constraint space of scalar-flat extensions, we derive the variational condition satisfied by a maximal capacity extension. The resulting equation is an inhomogeneous generalization of the well-known static equation, now coupled with the Baird--Eells stress-energy tensor for a harmonic function. We analyze these ``harmonic-static'' metrics in a local sense, proving they have constant scalar curvature and serve as critical points for a metric-dependent Dirichlet energy functional. We conclude with a number of open questions.</description>

Abstract: We consider a composite system where AdS$_3$ gravity is coupled to a flat heat bath and investigate the mutual information between two subregions on the intersection of the AdS$_3$ and bath, referred to as the boundary mutual information (BMI). The corresponding entanglement entropy is captured via quantum extremal surfaces (QES), which holographically be computed by a surface optimization algorithm based on ``Surface Evolver''. We focus on both connected and disconnected configurations of the quantum entanglement wedge (Q-EW) in the AdS$_3$ bulk and analyze the finite corrections to the BMI. Our numerical results reveal a phase transition of the BMI as the separation between two subregions increases. Furthermore, we find that the BMI can naturally be decomposed into two distinct components: a geometric term arising from the areas of the quantum extremal surfaces, and a correction term resulting from bulk quantum fields within the Q-EW. Interestingly, the geometric contribution always exceeds the total BMI, indicating a negative correction from the bulk matter fields. This negativity can be understood as the result of subtracting a greater contribution from quantum fields in the connected Q-EW than in the disconnected one. We also reproduce the negative contribution of bulk quantum fields to BMI within a random tensor network (RTN) toy model of double holography. Modeling the bulk as a highly mixed state entangled with a large bath leads to a volume-law bulk entropy. In the large bond-dimension limit, the geometric part of the BMI remains non-negative, while the bulk entropy contribution becomes non-positive when the Q-EWs merge.</description>

      <title>Circular strings, magnons, plane waves and local quenches in BTZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that string theory on the geometry $BTZ\times S^3\times M$ supported with either Neveu-Schwarz flux or Ramond flux admits states which obey identical dispersion relations to those of classical solutions like circular strings, giant magnons, or plane wave excitations in the geometry $ AdS_3 \times S^3 \times M$. Here, $M$ can be $T^4$, $K3$, or $S^3\times S^1$. This is made possible by the map, which takes the particle at the origin of $AdS_3$ with angular momentum along one of the angles of $S_3$ to a particle falling into the BTZ horizon. We use this map to construct circular strings, magnons, as well as plane waves in the BTZ geometry. We show that the $SL(2, R)$ charges of these states on $AdS_3$ and that of the corresponding states in the BTZ geometry are related by a boost. The dual description of these states in the BTZ geometry are local quench in the thermal CFT. These quenches carry energy density, $R$-charges, non-trivial expectation value of the marginal operator dual to the dilaton and move on the light cone in CFT. In general, the left and the right moving quenches are not symmetric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In these lecture notes, a group-theoretical introduction to BMS symmetries is provided in a self-contained manner. More precisely, all definitions and structures are purely based on geometrical and group-theoretical notions defined at null infinity and valid in any dimension, in a way that circumvents its traditional bulk realisation as asymptotic symmetries. The topics which are reviewed are: the definition of BMS transformations as conformal Carrollian isometries of null infinity, the semidirect structure of the BMS group, the holographic reconstruction of Minkowski spacetime in terms of good cuts, the one-to-one correspondence between good cut subspaces and Poincar\'e subgroups (aka vacua), as well as a basic introduction to unitary representations of the BMS group.</description>

      <title>Extensions of spacetime Bartnik data and estimates for the Bartnik mass outside of time-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bartnik's quasi-local mass is a functional on Bartnik data $(\mathbb S^2,\gamma,H,P,\omega^\perp)$, consisting of a metric $\gamma$, scalar functions $H$ and $P$, and a 1-form $\omega^\perp$ on the $2$-sphere $\mathbb S^2$. We construct initial data $(M,g,K)$ for the Einstein equations with boundary $\Sigma\cong\mathbb S^2$, and boundary conditions for $g$ and $K$ determined by Bartnik data with $H,P$ constant and $\omega^\perp\equiv0$. Furthermore this initial data agrees with spherically symmetric initial data for a Schwarzschild spacetime outside of a compact set with controlled mass. As an application, we obtain estimates for the Bartnik mass for such Bartnik data, outside of the time-symmetric setting.
  We also construct initial data on the cylinder $\mathbb S^2\times[0,1]$ connecting this same class of Bartnik data to time-symmetric data so that estimates for the Bartnik mass outside of time-symmetry can be obtained from prior estimates for time-symmetric data.</description>

      <title>An updated constraint for the Gravitational Wave Background from the Gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi LAT observations of gamma-ray pulsars can be used to build a pulsar timing array (PTA) experiment to search for gravitational wave (GW) signals at nanohertz frequencies. At those frequencies, the dominant signal is expected to be a stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) produced by the incoherent superposition of the quasi-monochromatic GW emissions from a population of supermassive black hole binaries. While the radio PTAs have recently announced compelling evidence for a GWB signal with a power law spectrum of strain amplitude $\approx2-3\times10^{-15}$ (at the frequency of $1 {\rm yr}^{-1}$), in 2022 an analysis of $12.5$ years of Fermi data for 35 pulsars led to an upper limit of $1\times10^{-14}$ for the GWB amplitude. The analysis was carried out on times-of-arrival (TOAs) obtained by folding from six months up to one year of photon observations. A photon-by-photon approach was also tested to infer constraints on the GWB amplitude from individual pulsars, but without accounting for the cross-pulsar correlations that a GWB would induce. Here, we reanalyse the same dataset using a regularized likelihood method that correctly models cross-pulsar correlations directly from the photons, while additionally marginalising over the uncertain pulse profile shape. While the two methods are not expected to have significant differences in sensitivity, we prove through simulations of gamma-ray PTA datasets that the photon-by-photon method for GWB recoveries is, statistically, more robust. The resulting upper limit obtained for the GWB strain amplitude is $1.2\times10^{-14}$, indicating that the improved method yields a consistent result with the previous analyses.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Background of Alice-Vortices and R7-Branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Codimension-two vortex solutions are important solitonic objects in both quantum field theory and gravity. In this paper, we construct a class of codimension-two Alice-vortex solutions in axio-dilaton gravity, in which monodromy around the vortex enacts the axion transformation $C_0 \mapsto -C_0$. In IIB supergravity, this furnishes a class of R7-brane backgrounds of the sort predicted by the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture. Such configurations generically carry an intrinsic dipole moment. We extract additional properties of such branes from scattering probes. These results provide further evidence that the worldvolume theory of an R7-brane is an 8D non-supersymmetric interacting quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct static, spherically symmetric, charged traversable wormhole solutions to the Einstein--Maxwell equations, supported by bidirectional (ingoing and outgoing) null dust with negative energy, and discuss a scenario for their dynamical formation from a black hole. Our solution contains a traversable throat, where the areal radius takes a minimum, although the spacetime is not asymptotically flat. In our formation scenario, the spacetime evolves sequentially from a black hole to Vaidya regions and finally to a wormhole, with each transition mediated by an impulsive null shell. We find that the radius of the wormhole throat is determined by the mass and charge of the initial black hole as well as those of the injected shell.</description>

      <title>Dirty Black Holes, Clean Signals: Near-Horizon vs. Environmental Effects on Grey-Body Factors and Hawking Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grey-body factors are not only essential ingredients for computing the intensity of Hawking radiation, but also serve as characteristics of black hole's geometry that are closely related to their quasinormal modes. Importantly, they tend to be more stable under small deformations of the background spacetime. In this work, we carry out a detailed analysis of grey-body factors and Hawking radiation for a spherically symmetric black hole subject to localized deformations which do not alter the Hawking temperature: near-horizon modifications to simulate possible new physics or matter fields, and far-zone perturbations to model environmental or astrophysical effects. We show that environmental deformations have only a minor impact on the grey-body factors and Hawking radiation--unless the additional potential barrier created by the environment becomes comparable in height to the primary peak associated with the black hole itself, a scenario more relevant to nonlinear dynamics. In contrast, near-horizon deformations significantly affect the Hawking spectrum, particularly in the low-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation model and its reheating features in light of the recent ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model consistent with the ACT data at the $68\%$ confidence level, the number of e-folds must increase while the reheating temperature decreases. We find that the Starobinsky model requires a spectator field to achieve efficient preheating. The preheating stage and the reheating temperature must be significantly adjusted to accommodate the lower temperature. In this paper, the favored non-minimal coupling of the produced particles is approximately $10$ or slightly lower. We also present viable parameter sets that fit the preferred reheating mechanism in this model. For certain parameter choices, the daughter fields could potentially be detected in future collider experiments such as the LHC or the ILC. Furthermore, our proposed mechanism can reproduce the lower reheating temperature, but it fails when the temperature falls below $1$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Trace anomaly contributions to semi-classical wormhole geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate wormhole solutions within the framework of the semi-classical Einstein equations in the presence of the conformal anomaly (or trace anomaly). These solutions are sourced by a stress-energy tensor (SET) derived from the trace anomaly, and depend on two positive coefficients, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$, determined by the matter content of the theory and on the degrees of freedom of the involved quantum fields. For a Type B anomaly ($\alpha=0$), we obtain wormhole geometries assuming a constant redshift function and show that the SET components increase with the parameter $\lambda$. In the case of a Type A anomaly ($\lambda=0$), we generalize previously known solutions, yielding a family of geometries that includes Lorentzian wormholes, naked singularities, and the Schwarzschild black hole. Using isotropic coordinates, we identify parameter choices that produce traversable wormhole solutions. Extending to the full trace-anomaly contribution, we solve the differential equation near the throat to obtain the redshift function and demonstrate that both the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars remain finite at the throat. We further analyze the trajectories of null and timelike particles, showing that the height and width of the effective potential for null geodesics increase monotonically with $\alpha$, while the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) radius also grows with larger $\alpha$. These results illustrate the rich interplay between trace anomaly effects and the structure and dynamics of wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Neglected solutions in quadratic gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on several previously overlooked families of static spherically symmetric solutions in quadratic gravity. Our main result concerns the existence of solutions whose leading exponents depend on the ratio ${\omega=\alpha/(3\beta)}$ of the four-derivative couplings. We demonstrate that the space of models with ${\omega &gt;1}$ contains a dense set that admits non-Frobenius solutions ${(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_0}$ (in standard Schwarzschild coordinates), with certain rational numbers $s_*(\omega)$. These solutions correspond to a singular core at ${\bar{r}=0}$. Another related non-Frobenius family, $(s_*, 2 - 3 s_*)_\infty$, exists for a dense set of models with ${1/4 &lt; \omega &lt; 1}$, describing a singular boundary at ${\bar{r}\to\infty}$. Both families are uncovered by recasting the metric into special coordinates in which the solutions become Frobenius. Additionally, for models with real ratios ${\omega\neq 1}$ we identify six novel families of non-Frobenius solutions around points ${\bar{r}=\bar{r}_0} \neq 0$, describing horizons and wormhole throats. Finally, we re-derive and summarize all known families of solutions in modified as well as in the standard Schwarzschild coordinates.</description>

      <title>Photon rings and shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss photon rings around as well as shadows of Kerr black holes immersed in a swirling spacetime (KBHSU). We find that the spin-spin interaction between the angular momentum of the black hole and the swirling of the background leads to new interesting effects as it breaks the symmetry between the upper and lower hemispheres. We find that a pair of light rings exists for all values of the parameter space. Using a topological argument, we prove that there should be, indeed, two light rings and that, additionally, these light rings are unstable. In comparison to the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a swirling universe, the light rings typically all possess different radii. Interestingly, as the value of the swirling parameter is increased at fixed angular momentum of the black hole the two disconnected patches of the ergoregions eventually merge. The light ring at this merger possesses no angular velocity (as measured by an observer at infinity) and is called a \textit{light point}. To our knowledge, this is the first time the existence of such a light point in a black hole space-time is reported. Finally, we also present the shadows of KBHSU for various parameter values and observe that, due to the presence of the swirling background, the shadows are twisted.</description>

      <title>Can the diffeomorphism and Gauss constraints be holonomy corrected in the deformed algebra approach to modified gravity?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deforming the algebra of constraint is a well-known approach to effective loop quantum cosmology. More generally, it is a consistent way to modify gravity from the Hamiltonian perspective. In this framework, the Hamiltonian (scalar) constraint is usually the only one to be holonomy corrected. As a heuristic hypothesis, we consider the possibility to also correct the diffeomorphism and Gauss constraints. It is shown that it is impossible to correct the diffeomorphism constraint without correcting the Gauss one, while maintaining a first-class algebra. However, if all constraints are corrected, the algebra can be closed. The resulting differential equations to be fulfilled by the corrections (of the background and of the perturbations) are derived.</description>

      <title>Towards an anomaly detection pipeline for gravitational waves at the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the implementation of an anomaly-detection algorithm based on a deep convolutional autoencoder for the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in time-frequency spectrograms. Our method targets short-duration ($\lesssim 2\,\text{s}$) GW signals, exemplified by mergers of compact objects forming or involving an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Such short signals are difficult to distinguish from background noise; yet their brevity makes them well-suited to machine-learning analyses with modest computational requirements. Using the data from the Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge as a benchmark, we demonstrate that the approach can successfully flag GW-like transients as anomalies in interferometer data of a single detector, achieving an initial detection efficiency of 23% for injected signals corresponding to IMBH-forming mergers. After introducing weak supervision, the model exhibits excellent generalisation and recovers all injected IMBH-forming mergers, independent of their total mass or signal-to-noise ratio, with a false-alarm rate due to statistical noise fluctuations of approximately 4.5 events per year for a single interferometer operating with a 100% duty cycle. The method also successfully identifies lower-mass mergers leading to the formation of black holes with mass larger than $\simeq 20\,M_\odot$. Our pipeline does not yet classify anomalies, distinguishing between actual GW signals and noise artefacts; however, it highlights any deviation from the learned background noise distribution for further scrutiny. These results demonstrate that anomaly detection offers a powerful, model-independent framework for future GW searches, paving the way toward fully automated and adaptive analysis pipelines.</description>

Abstract: GW200105 is the first gravitational wave detection to show signs of eccentricity, it also is a neutron star - blackhole binary. This raises the need for waveforms that incorporate tidal effects on quasi-elliptic orbits. We tackle the problem of finite size effects within the post-Newtonian framework, including the mass-type quadrupole and octupole, as well as the current-type quadrupole deformations in the adiabatic approximation. The computations are performed at the second-and-a-half relative post-Newtonian order. We first derive the quasi-Keplerian parametrization of the conservative motion; we then express the radial separation and phase with their time derivatives in terms of the orbital frequency, the time eccentricity and the eccentric anomaly. To obtain these as functions of time, we invert the generalized Kepler equation while also discussing the convergence of eccentricity expanded results. We provide those results to the fourteenth order in eccentricity. Finally, we exploit the already known radiation reaction term of the acceleration in order to derive the secular and oscillatory evolutions of the orbital elements. The companion paper contains the derivation of the radiated fluxes and the amplitude modes of the strain. All relevant results are provided in an ancillary file.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic tides in compact binaries on quasi-elliptic orbits: Radiation at the second-and-a-half relative post-Newtonian order</title>

Abstract: We compute the gravitational fluxes and waveform for eccentric compact binaries including matter effects through adiabatic tidal interactions within the post-Newtonian approximation. The computations are performed at the relative 2.5PN order. Using the dynamics derived in the companion paper, we first derive the radiated energy and angular momentum, from which we deduce the equations describing the secular evolution of the orbital elements. We numerically solve for the secular dynamics for various systems. We find that the eccentric corrections to tidal terms induce a dephasing that could potentially be detectable in some regions of the parameter space of gravitational wave sources. Finally, we compute the amplitude of the strain, decomposed in spin-weighted spherical harmonics. Besides the memory contributions that are left for future works, we provide the amplitude modes containing the instantaneous, tail and post-adiabatic corrections expanded to the twelfth order in eccentricity. All relevant results are provided in an ancillary file.</description>

      <title>Assessing astrophysical foreground subtraction in DECIGO using compact binary populations inferred from the first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's fourth observation run</title>

Abstract: Detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from our Universe under the inflationary era is one of the primary scientific objectives of DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO), a space-borne gravitational wave detector sensitive in the 0.1Hz frequency band. This frequency band is dominated by the gravitational waves from inspiraling compact object binaries. Subtracting these signals is necessary to search for the primordial SGWB. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of the subtraction of such binary signals by employing the population model inferred from the latest gravitational wave event catalogue of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We find that the projection scheme, which was originally proposed by Cutler &amp; Harms (2005), is necessary to reduce the binary signals to the level where DECIGO can detect the primordial background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) generally requires large density perturbations, which is widely supported by researchers. This paper studies the local coupling properties of the Starobinsky and Kachru-Kallosh-Linde-Trivedi (KKLT) potentials by introducing a linear Lorentzian-type coupling, which locally breaks the slow-roll conditions. We find that both positive and negative couplings can generate a considerable abundance of PBH. Additionally, we study the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) generated by this model.</description>

      <title>Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational-wave echoes have been widely interpreted as probes of near-horizon structure and quantum modifications of black holes. We revisit the mechanism by which echoes are suppressed in a diffeomorphism-invariant, analytic entire-function ultraviolet completion of quantum gravity. We show that the absence of observable echoes is not due to a suppression of quasinormal-mode frequencies or a filtering of the gravitational-wave spectrum. The extreme blueshift of the proper local frequency in the near-horizon region activates the diffeomorphism-invariant entire-function regulator, which smooths out sharp reflecting inner structures and drives the reflection coefficient to zero. The nonlocal regulator acts as a covariant smearing operator on effective stress--energy and curvature, replacing sharp, partially reflective surfaces by smooth transition regions. As a result, the would-be echo cavity required for repeated reflections fails to form, and the associated phase-coherent back scattering is eliminated. This mechanism applies both to regular black holes with horizons and to horizonless compact objects generated by nonlocal smearing, and is independent of the detailed value of the nonlocal scale provided it lies at or above the Planck scale. Our results clarify the physical origin of echo suppression in nonlocal quantum gravity and demonstrate that the absence of echoes is a structural consequence of analytic nonlocality rather than a dynamical damping of gravitational-wave frequencies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology in $f(R, T)$ Theory with Schutz's Perfect Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $f(R, T)$ theory of gravity extends general relativity (GR) by allowing the gravitational Lagrangian to depend on both the Ricci scalar $R$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. The resulting matter-geometry coupling introduces additional dynamical effects that may account for the late-time acceleration of the universe without invoking dark energy. In the present work, we focus instead on the early-time regime and investigate the corresponding quantum cosmological dynamics. We analyze a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) universe within the $f(R, T)$ framework, employing Schutz's perfect fluid formalism to extract a time parameter emerging from the matter sector itself. This approach is particularly well motivated in $f(R, T)$ gravity, where the coupling between geometry and the energy-momentum tensor's trace makes matter an active participant in the dynamics of spacetime and the evolution of cosmic time. The gravitational Hamiltonian, canonical momenta, and potential are derived, leading to the corresponding Schr\"odinger--Wheeler--DeWitt (SWDW) equation. The wave function of the universe is obtained for specific forms of $f(R, T)$, and the results are compared with previous studies in $f(R)$ and $f(R, T)$ models, highlighting the role of matter-geometry coupling in the emergence of quantum cosmological dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider the vacuum Einstein field equations under the Belinski-Zakharov symmetry, which leaves the problem as a 1+1-dimensional quasilinear system of PDEs. Depending on the chosen signature of the metric, these spacetimes contain most of the well-known special solutions in General Relativity. In this paper, {\color{blue} we consider the case of cosmological metrics, in the Belinsky-Zakharov notation}, and prove global existence of small Belinski-Zakharov spacetimes under a natural nondegeneracy condition. We also construct new energies and virial functionals to provide a description of the energy decay of smooth global cosmological metrics inside the light cone. Finally, some applications are presented in the case {\color{blue} of the particular metrics called} generalized Kasner solitons.</description>

      <title>Quantum metasurfaces as probes of vacuum particle content</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum of the electromagnetic field is inherently entangled across distinct spatial sub-regions resulting in entangled particle content across these sub-regions. However accessing this particle content in a controlled laboratory experiment has remained out of experimental reach. Here we propose to overcome this challenge with a quantum mirror made from a two-dimensional sub-wavelength array of atoms that divides a photonic cavity. The array response to light is tunable between transmissive and reflective states by a control atom that is excited to a Rydberg state. We find that vacuum photon content from non-perturbative changes of the boundary conditions and therefore distinct spatial sub regions of the vacuum causes subtle frequency shifts that are accessible to sub-wavelength atom array platforms. This novel approach for probing vacuum particle content stems from the unique ability to create coherent dynamics of superpositions of transmissive and reflective states providing a quantum enhanced platform for observing vacuum particle creation from highly non-perturbative boundary condition changes of the electromagnetic field vacuum.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmological principle on gigaparsec scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observational analyses have suggested possible evidence of hemisphere asymmetry in cosmological datasets. Parameterizations of this kind place observers in a privileged position-specifically on the plane that divides the two hemispheres. To quantify potential deviations from the cosmological principle without presuming a special location, we develop a stochastic framework that parametrizes departures from statistical homogeneity and isotropy. The near-uniform temperature of the cosmic microwave background indicates that anisotropy is negligible (at the $\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface. This serves as a zero boundary condition, enabling the construction of an orthogonal basis of functions below the recombination redshift. Within this basis, we expand the relative deviation from the Hubble diagram of isotropic models (such as $\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) in a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Applying this approach, we test the cosmological principle using Type Ia supernovae, strong lensing time delays, and gravitational-wave standard sirens. For the class of large-scale anisotropies and low-order radial variations described by this framework, the current datasets are found to be consistent with statistical homogeneity and isotropy on gigaparsec scales.</description>

      <title>CMB line-of-sight integrators for nearly-isotropic cosmological models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homogeneous and nearly-isotropic cosmological models are natural extensions of standard Friedmann cosmologies. Constraining their features is crucial, as any detection of their properties would impact our understanding of inflation and the cosmological principle. Since these models evolve as a set of non-interacting scalar, vector, and tensor modes on top of homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, their imprints on cosmological observables, particularly the CMB, can be obtained using standard line-of-sight methods. This requires (1) that one resorts on Laplacian eigenmodes on spatially curved spaces and (2) that radial functions for these modes are analytically continued to accommodate complex (i.e., supercurvature) wavenumbers. We introduce two line-of-sight integrators implementing the evolution of the CMB anisotropies in these models: \texttt{AniLoS}, a user-friendly and easy to modify \texttt{Python} package, and \texttt{AniCLASS}, an advanced and efficient extension of the Boltzmann solver \texttt{CLASS}. We discuss possible initial conditions that could generate such fluctuations and provide illustrative examples using our codes. This work offers a pathway for leveraging diverse cosmological datasets to constrain superhorizon anisotropies of the late-time universe.</description>

      <title>Simulating a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background signal in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum and spatial correlation (Hellings \&amp; Downs curve), describe the variances and correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang" mean? What was the actual origin of these two words? There are many aspects hidden under this name, which are seldom explained. They are discussed here. To frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. And this includes names given to outstanding theorems and spectacular discoveries, too. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled in this context. These points will be at the heart of the quest here, concerning the concept of ``Big Bang", which only a few people know what it means, actually. Fred Hoyle was the first to pronounce these words, in a BBC radio program, with a meaning that was later called inflation. But listeners were left with the image he was trying to destroy: the explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (an absolutely wrong concept). Hoyle's Steady State will be carefully compared with inflation cosmology. They are quite different, and yet, in both cases, the possibility of creating matter/energy out of expanding space is rooted in the same fundamental principles: those of General Relativity. As is also, the possibility of having a universe with zero total energy, anticipated by R.C. Tolman, in 1934 already. It will be shown, how to obtain accelerated expansion from negative pressure; how to reconcile energy conservation with matter creation in an expanding universe; and a curious relation between de Sitter spacetime and Steady State cosmology. Concerning the naming issue, it will be remarked that, today, the same label ``Big Bang" is used in very different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

Abstract: We prove the past nonlinear stability of the sub-critical Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations on a truncated cone domain in spacetime dimensions $n\geq4$. Our analysis demonstrates that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete in the contracting direction and terminate at quiescent and crushing singularities characterized by the blow-up of curvature invariants. This work generalizes the result of Beyer-Oliynyk-Zheng in [arXiv:2502.09210v2] to all higher dimensional spacetimes.</description>

      <title>LISA Non-Linear Dynamics and Tilt-To-Length Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the LISA mission, Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling is expected to be one of the dominant instrumental noise contributions after laser frequency noise is suppressed based, on assumptions on the size of the coupling and angular jitter levels. This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting.</description>
