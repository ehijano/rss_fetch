      <title>Comment on "Direct Targeting and Regulation of RNA Polymerase II by Cell Signaling Kinases"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dabas et al. in Science 2025 report that approximately 117 human kinases directly phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II), proposing an extensive, direct biochemical bridge between signal transduction and transcriptional control. Such a sweeping claim that one-fourth of the human kinome directly targets the CTD represents a profound revision of canonical transcriptional biology. However, the evidence presented relies primarily on in vitro kinase assays using short CTD peptides, sparse in-cell validation, and mechanistically incomplete models of nuclear trafficking, chromatin targeting, structural compatibility, and catalytic specificity. In this extended critique, we demonstrate that the conclusions of this study are not supported by current biochemical, structural, cell biological, or genomic data. We outline severe shortcomings in assay design, lack of quantitative kinetics, incompatibilities with known Pol II structural constraints, unsupported assumptions about nuclear localization, inappropriate extension to "direct-at-gene" mechanisms, absence of global transcriptional effects, failure to align with the essential role of canonical CDKs, and missing transparency in dataset reporting. We conclude that the central claims of the study are premature and contradicted by decades of established transcriptional research. Substantial new evidence is required before revising the mechanistic model of Pol II CTD regulation.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE) Quantifies Stage-Specific Regulatory Effects From Single-Cell Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying key driver genes governing biological processes such as development and disease progression remains a challenge. While existing methods can reconstruct cellular trajectories or infer static gene regulatory networks (GRNs), they often fail to quantify time-resolved regulatory effects within specific temporal windows. Here, we present Time-varying Network Driver Estimation (TNDE), a computational framework quantifying dynamic gene driver effects from single-cell snapshot data under a linear Markov assumption. TNDE leverages a shared graph attention encoder to preserve the local topological structure of the data. Furthermore, by incorporating partial optimal transport, TNDE accounts for unmatched cells arising from proliferation or apoptosis, thereby enabling trajectory alignment in non-equilibrium processes. Benchmarking on simulated datasets demonstrates that TNDE outperforms existing baseline methods across diverse complex regulatory scenarios. Applied to mouse erythropoiesis data, TNDE identifies stage-specific driver genes, the functional relevance of which is corroborated by biological validation. TNDE offers an effective quantitative tool for dissecting dynamic regulatory mechanisms underlying complex biological processes.</description>
