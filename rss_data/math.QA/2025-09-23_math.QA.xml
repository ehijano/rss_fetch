      <title>Double Yangians and quantum vertex algebras, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any simply-laced generalized Cartan matrix $A$, we introduce an algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$, which is essentially the centrally extended double Yangian when $A$ is of finite type, and we give a new field (current) presentation of $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$. Among the main results, for any $\ell\in \mathbb C$ we construct a universal vacuum $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-module $\mathcal{V}_A(\ell)$ of level $\ell$, prove that there exists a natural $\hbar$-adic weak quantum vertex algebra structure on $\mathcal{V}_A(\ell)$, and give an isomorphism between the category of restricted $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-modules of level $\ell$ and the category of $\mathcal{V}_A(\ell)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Double Yangians and lattice quantum vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any simply-laced GCM $A$, a $\mathbb C[[\hbar]]$-algebra $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$ was introduced in [KL1], where it was proved that the universal vacuum $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-module ${\mathcal{V}}_A(\ell)$ for any fixed level $\ell$ is naturally an $\hbar$-adic weak quantum vertex algebra. Let $L$ be the root lattice of $\mathfrak g(A)$. As the main results of this paper, we construct an $\hbar$-adic quantum vertex algebra $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$ as a formal deformation of the lattice vertex algebra $V_L$ and show that every $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$-module is naturally a restricted $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-module of level one. For $A$ of finite type, we obtain a realization of $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$ as a quotient of the $\hbar$-adic weak quantum vertex algebra ${\mathcal{V}}_A(1)$, giving a characterization of $V_L[[\hbar]]^{\eta}$-modules as restricted $\widehat{\mathcal{DY}}(A)$-modules of level one.</description>

      <title>On some log-concavity properties of the Alexander-Conway and Links-Gould invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Links--Gould invariant $\mathrm{LG}(L ; t_0, t_1)$ of a link $L$ is a two-variable quantum generalization of the Alexander--Conway polynomial $\Delta_L(t)$ and has been shown to share some of its most geometric features in several recent works. Here we suggest that $\mathrm{LG}$ likely shares another of the Alexander polynomial's most distinctive - and mysterious - properties: for alternating links, the coefficients of the Links-Gould polynomial alternate and appear to form a log-concave two-indexed sequence with no internal zeros. The former was observed by Ishii for knots with up to 10 crossings. We further conjecture that they satisfy a bidimensional property of unimodality, thereby replicating a long-standing conjecture of Fox (1962) regarding the Alexander polynomial, and a subsequent refinement by Stoimenow. We also point out that the Stoimenow conjecture reflects a more structural phenomenon: after a suitable normalization, the Alexander polynomial of an alternating link appears to be a Lorentzian polynomial. We give compelling experimental and computational evidence for these different properties.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Casimir elements and hook partitions for quantum groups of types B, C and D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The higher-order quantum Casimir elements, introduced by Zhang, Bracken, and Gould in the early 1990s, were conjectured to generate the centre of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum (super)groups. This was previously confirmed in the classical type A. In this paper we extend the result to the classical types B, C, D, with the additional inclusion of quantum Casimir elements arising from spin and half-spin representations in types B and D. We identify the Harish-Chandra images of these elements and reinterpret them uniformly in terms of irreducible characters associated with hook partitions. This yields explicit and minimal generating sets for the centres in all classical types, and provides new connections between higher-order quantum Casimir elements and hook partitions that exhibit a stability phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Modules over the category of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear category $\mathbf{A}$ of Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies was introduced by Habiro and Massuyeau. We study the category of modules over the category $\mathbf{A}$. We generalize the adjunction given by Powell to an adjunction between the category of $\mathbf{A}$-modules and the category of modules over the linear PROP for Casimir Lie algebras by using the category $\mathbf{A}^{L}$ of extended Jacobi diagrams in handlebodies. Then we study subquotient $\mathbf{A}$-modules of $\mathbf{A}(0,-)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for Solving Generalized Linear Systems via Momentum Accelerated Gradient and Schr\"odingerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that combines the momentum accelerated gradient method with Schr\"odingerization [S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. Lett, 133 (2024), 230602][S. Jin, N. Liu and Y. Yu, Phys. Rev. A, 108 (2023), 032603], achieving polynomial speedup over its classical counterpark in solving linear systems. The algorithm achieves a query complexity of the same order as the Schr\"odingerization based damped dynamical system method, namely, linear dependence on the condition number of the matrix, and can overcome the practical limitations of existing non-Schr\"odingerization-based quantum linear system algorithms. These limitations stem from their reliance on techniques such as VTAA and RM, which introduce substantial quantum hardware resource overhead. Furthermore, it demonstrates both theoretically and experimentally that the auxiliary variables introduced by our method do not dominate the error reduction at any point, thereby preventing a significant increase in the actual evolution time compared to the theoretical prediction. In contrast, the damped method fails to meet this criterion. This gives new perspectives for quantum algorithms for linear systems, establishing a novel analytical framework for algorithms with broader applicability, faster convergence rates, and superior solution quality.</description>

      <title>Invertible projective 2-representations from invertible 2d TQFTs with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate invertible projective representations and their 2-categorical analogues using the language of TQFTs with defects. The main result is a freeness property for invertible projective representatios. While trivial in the 1-categorical setting, this result becomes interesting for 2-representations: as an application, only relying only on invertibility of Clifford algebras and Fock bimodules in the Morita 2-category of super vector spaces we recover Ludewig--Roos' result that the Clifford/Fock construction is a projective 2-representation of the category of Lagrangian correspondences.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Holomorphic Twist II: Anomalies and Extended Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twists of four-dimensional supersymmetric quantum field theories (SQFTs) isolate protected sectors with rich algebraic structures. We develop a unified framework for analyzing symmetries and anomalies in four-dimensional holomorphically twisted SQFTs, combiningcomplex-geometric and algebraic perspectives. This approach clarifies the connections between existing formulations in the literature and resolves several open questions left unanswered in the first installment of this series.
  We place particular emphasis on theories with extended supersymmetry, where the holomorphic twist gives rise to enhanced algebraic and geometric structures. We explain how these features emerge and govern the organization of the twisted theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a superconformal deformation of the twisted theory naturally leads to the associated vertex operator algebra, clarifying how the higher algebraic structures of the holomorphically twisted theory give rise to vertex algebras structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for the existence of gauge equivalences in complete differential graded Lie algebras. Specifically, this theory provides a characterization of homotopy equivalences between differential graded algebras governed by operads or properads, potentially colored in a groupoid. We apply this framework to establish new homotopy equivalence results in both algebraic topology and algebraic geometry, with a particular focus on the study of minimal models for highly connected varieties.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Rectangular Recurrence Relations in $\mathfrak{gl}_{n}$ and $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ Invariant Integrable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method is introduced to derive general recurrence relations for off-shell Bethe vectors in quantum integrable models with either type $\mathfrak{gl}_n$ or type $\mathfrak{o}_{2n+1}$ symmetries. These recurrence relations describe how to add a single parameter $z$ to specific subsets of Bethe parameters, expressing the resulting Bethe vector as a linear combination of monodromy matrix entries that act on Bethe vectors which do not depend on $z$. We refer to these recurrence relations as rectangular because the monodromy matrix entries involved are drawn from the upper-right rectangular part of the matrix. This construction is achieved within the framework of the zero mode method.</description>

Abstract: For any cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$, we first determine the Casimir number and determinant of the Haagerup-Izumi fusion ring $\mathcal{HI}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$, it turns out that they do not share the same set of prime factors. Then we show that all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathcal{HI}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$ are defined over certain cyclotomic fields. As a direct result, we obtain the formal codegrees of $\mathcal{HI}_{\mathbb{Z}_n}$, which satisfy the pseudo-unitary inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted holography captures protected aspects of well-known holographic dualities. We show how the holographic dual B-model background can be systematically derived from the 't Hooft expansion of the chiral algebras associated to four-dimensional ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal quiver gauge theories. A crucial tool is the match of planar BRST anomalies in the field theory and on the worldsheet, especially in the presence of probe D-branes. Our construction is very general and can be applied to chiral algebras which do not have a four-dimensional origin. The resulting holographic dual backgrounds are typically non-geometric and appear to be novel. We expect our strategy to have a wide range of applications to other examples of twisted holography and, potentially, weak coupling holography.</description>

      <title>W-algebras, Gaussian Free Fields and $\mathfrak{g}$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the intrinsic connection between Gaussian Free Fields and the Heisenberg vertex algebra, we study some aspects of the correspondence between probability theory and $W$-algebras. This is first achieved by providing a construction of the $W$-algebra associated to a complex simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ by means of Gaussian Free Fields.
  This correspondence in turn allows to translate algebraic statements into actual constraints for free-field correlation functions. This leads to new integrability results for Dotsenko-Fateev integrals associated to $\mathfrak g$, such as Ward identities and the derivation of a new Fuchsian differential equation for deformations of $B_2$-Dotsenko-Fateev integrals arising from the Mukhin-Varchenko conjecture.
  Along the proof of this statement we also provide new results on representation theory of $W$-algebras such as the description of some singular vectors for the $W$-algebra associated to $\mathfrak g=B_2$.</description>

      <title>Relation morphisms of directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Associating graph algebras to directed graphs leads to both covariant and contravariant functors from suitable categories of graphs to the category k-Alg of algebras and algebra homomorphisms. As both functors are often used at the same time, finding a new category of graphs that allows a "common denominator" functor unifying the covariant and contravariant constructions is a fundamental problem. Herein, we solve this problem by first introducing the relation category of graphs RG, and then determining the concept of admissible graph relations that yields a subcategory of RG admitting a contravariant functor to k-Alg simultaneously generalizing the aforementioned covariant and contravariant functors. Although we focus on Leavitt path algebras and graph C*-algebras, on the way we unravel functors to k-Alg given by path algebras, Cohn path algebras and Toeplitz graph C*-algebras from suitable subcategories of RG. Better still, we illustrate relation morphisms of graphs by naturally occurring examples, including Cuntz algebras, quantum spheres and quantum balls.</description>

Abstract: We show that isomorphism classes $[\mathcal{A}]$ of flat $q\times q$ matrix bundles $\mathcal{A}$ (or projectively flat rank-$q$ complex vector bundles $\mathcal{E}$) on a pro-torus $\mathbb{T}$ are in bijective correspondence with the \v{C}ech cohomology group $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu_q:=\text{$q^{th}$ roots of unity})$ (respectively $H^2(\mathbb{T},\mathbb{Z})$) via the image of $[A]\in H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ through $H^1(\mathbb{T},PGL(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))\xrightarrow{\quad}H^2(\mathbb{T},\mu(q,\mathcal{C}_{\mathbb{T}}))$ (respectively the first Chern class $c_1(\mathcal{E})$). This is in the spirit of Auslander-Szczarba's result identifying real flat bundles on the torus with their first two Stiefel-Whitney classes, and contrasts with classifying spaces $B\Gamma$ of compact Lie groups $\Gamma$ (as opposed to $\mathbb{T}^n\cong B\mathbb{Z}^n$), on which flat non-trivial vector bundles abound. The discussion both recovers the Disney-Elliott-Kumjian-Raeburn classification of rational non-commutative tori $\mathbb{T}^n_{\theta}$ with a different, bundle-theoretic proof, and sheds some light on the connection between topological invariants associated to $\mathbb{T}^2_{\theta}$, $\theta\in\mathbb{Q}$ by Rieffel and respectively H{\o}egh-Krohn-Skjelbred.</description>
