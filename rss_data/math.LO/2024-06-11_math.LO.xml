      <title>Monadic ortholattices: completions and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the variety of monadic ortholattices is closed under MacNeille and canonical completions. In each case, the completion of $L$ is obtained by forming an associated dual space $X$ that is a monadic orthoframe. This is a set with an orthogonality relation and an additional binary relation satisfying certain conditions. For the MacNeille completion, $X$ is formed from the non-zero elements of $L$, and for the canonical completion, $X$ is formed from the proper filters of $L$. The corresponding completion of $L$ is then obtained as the ortholattice of bi-orthogonally closed subsets of $X$ with an additional operation defined through the binary relation of $X$.
  With the introduction of a suitable topology on an orthoframe, as was done by Goldblatt and Bimb\'o, we obtain a dual adjunction between the categories of monadic ortholattices and monadic orthospaces. A restriction of this dual adjunction provides a dual equivalence.</description>

      <title>Robust non-computability of dynamical systems and computability of robust dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the relationship between the stability of the dynamical system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ and the computability of its basins of attraction. We present a computable $C^{\infty}$ system $x^{\prime}=f(x)$ that possesses a computable and stable equilibrium point, yet whose basin of attraction is robustly non-computable in a neighborhood of $f$ in the sense that both the equilibrium point and the non-computability of its associated basin of attraction persist when $f$ is slightly perturbed. This indicates that local stability near a stable equilibrium point alone is insufficient to guarantee the computability of its basin of attraction. However, we also demonstrate that the basins of attraction associated with a structurally stable - globally stable (robust) - planar system defined on a compact set are computable. Our findings suggest that the global stability of a system and the compactness of the domain play a pivotal role in determining the computability of its basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>Ideal Analytic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to give natural examples of $\mathbf{\Sigma}_1^1$-complete and $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete sets.
  In the first part, we consider ideals on $\omega$. In particular, we show that the Hindman ideal $\mathcal{H}$ is $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete and consider a number of ideals generated in the similar fashion. Moreover, we show that the ideal $\mathcal{D}$ is also $\mathbf{\Pi}_1^1$-complete.
  In the second part, we focus on families of trees (on $\omega$ and $2$) containing a specific tree type. We show the connection between two topics and explore some classical tree types (like Sacks and Miller).</description>

      <title>Definable henselian valuations in positive residue characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the question of $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ring}}$-definability of non-trivial henselian valuation rings. Building on previous work of Jahnke and Koenigsmann, we provide a characterization of henselian fields that admit a non-trivial definable henselian valuation. In particular, we treat cases where the canonical henselian valuation has positive residue characteristic, using techniques from the model theory and algebra of tame fields.</description>

      <title>Topological Vector Spaces: a non-standard approach with monads and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new and extensive formalism is developed for monads and galaxies in non-standard enlargements. It is shown that monads and galaxies can be manipulated using order-preserving and order-reversing set-to-set maps, and that set properties associated with these maps can be extended not only to internal sets but to all monads and galaxies. An abstract theory of Intersections of Galaxies is introduced. These concepts are applied to basic topology as well (locally convex) topological vector spaces, their various properties and completions, allowing these to be effortlessly defined and characterized. Duality theory is studied in this framework, allowing in particular to formulate new brief and insightful proofs for the theorems of Mackey-Arens and Grothendieck completeness without any technicalities.</description>

      <title>Hardness of busy beaver value BB(15)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The busy beaver value BB(n) is the maximum number of steps made by any n-state, 2-symbol deterministic halting Turing machine starting on blank tape. The busy beaver function $n \mapsto \text{BB}(n)$ is uncomputable and, from below, only 4 of its values, BB(1) ... BB(4), are known to date. This leads one to ask: from above, what is the smallest BB value that encodes a major mathematical challenge? Knowing BB(4,888) has been shown by Yedidia and Aaronson [28] to be at least as hard as solving Goldbach's conjecture, with a subsequent improvement, as yet unpublished, to BB(27) [4,1]. We prove that knowing BB(15) is at least as hard as solving the following Collatz-related conjecture by Erd\H{o}s, open since 1979 [9]: for all n &gt; 8 there is at least one digit 2 in the base 3 representation of $2^n$. We do so by constructing an explicit 15-state, 2-symbol Turing machine that halts if and only if the conjecture is false. This 2-symbol Turing machine simulates a conceptually simpler 5-state, 4-symbol machine which we construct first. This makes, to date, BB(15) the smallest busy beaver value that is related to a natural open problem in mathematics, bringing to light one of the many challenges underlying the quest of knowing busy beaver values.</description>
