      <title>The complexity of computing the period and the exponent of a digraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The period of a strongly connected digraph is the greatest common divisor of the lengths of all its cycles. The period of a digraph is the least common multiple of the periods of its strongly connected components that contain at least one cycle. These notions play an important role in the theory of Markov chains and the analysis of powers of nonnegative matrices. While the time complexity of computing the period is well-understood, little is known about its space complexity. We show that the problem of computing the period of a digraph is NL-complete, even if all its cycles are contained in the same strongly connected component. However, if the digraph is strongly connected, we show that this problem becomes L-complete. For primitive digraphs (that is, strongly connected digraphs of period one), there always exists a number $m$ such that there is a path of length exactly $m$ between every two vertices. We show that computing the smallest such $m$, called the exponent of a digraph, is NL-complete. The exponent of a primitive digraph is a particular case of the index of convergence of a nonnegative matrix, which we also show to be computable in NL, and thus NL-complete.</description>

      <title>Gromov's Approximating Tree and the All-Pairs Bottleneck Paths Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a pointed metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}, w)$ on $n$ points, its Gromov's approximating tree is a 0-hyperbolic pseudo-metric space $(X,\mathsf{dist}_T)$ such that $\mathsf{dist}(x,w)=\mathsf{dist}_T(x,w)$ and $\mathsf{dist}(x, y)-2 \delta \log_2n \leq \mathsf{dist}_T (x, y) \leq \mathsf{dist}(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$ where $\delta$ is the Gromov hyperbolicity of $X$. On the other hand, the all pairs bottleneck paths (APBP) problem asks, given an undirected graph with some capacities on its edges, to find the maximal path capacity between each pair of vertices. In this note, we prove:
  $\bullet$ Computing Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its matrix of distances reduces to solving the APBP problem on an connected graph with $n$ vertices.
  $\bullet$ There is an explicit algorithm that computes Gromov's approximating tree for a graph from its adjacency matrix in quadratic time.
  $\bullet$ Solving the APBP problem on a weighted graph with $n$ vertices reduces to finding Gromov's approximating tree for a metric space with $n+1$ points from its distance matrix.</description>

      <title>Towards a conjecture of Woodall for partial 3-trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1978, Woodall conjectured the following: in a planar digraph, the size of a shortest dicycle is equal to the maximum cardinality of a collection of disjoint transversals of dicycles. We prove that this conjecture is true when the underlying graph is a planar 3-tree.</description>

      <title>The complexity of strong conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new variant of graph coloring by adding a connectivity constraint. A path in a vertex-colored graph is called conflict-free if there is a color that appears exactly once on its vertices. A connected graph $G$ is said to be strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if $G$ admits a vertex $k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices of $G$ are connected by a conflict-free $shortest$ path.
  Among others, we show that deciding whether a given graph is strongly conflict-free vertex-connection $3$-colorable is NP-complete even when restricted to $3$-colorable graphs with diameter $3$, radius $2$ and domination number $3$, and, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), cannot be solved in $2^{o(n)}$ time on such restricted input graphs with $n$ vertices. This hardness result is quite strong when compared to the ordinary $3$-COLORING problem: it is known that $3$-COLORING is solvable in polynomial time in graphs with bounded domination number, and assuming ETH, cannot be solved in $2^{o(\sqrt{n})}$ time in $n$-vertex graphs with diameter $3$ and radius $2$. On the positive side, we point out that a strong conflict-free vertex-connection coloring with minimum color number of a given split graph or a co-bipartite graph can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing-Based Algorithm for Efficient Coalition Formation Among LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing number of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, driven by lower manufacturing and launch costs, is proving invaluable for Earth observation missions and low-latency internet connectivity. However, as the number of satellites increases, the number of communication links to maintain also rises, making the management of this vast network increasingly challenging and highlighting the need for clustering satellites into efficient groups as a promising solution. This paper formulates the clustering of LEO satellites as a coalition structure generation (CSG) problem and leverages quantum annealing to solve it. We represent the satellite network as a graph and obtain the optimal partitions using a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm called GCS-Q. The algorithm follows a top-down approach by iteratively splitting the graph at each step using a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. To evaluate our approach, we utilize real-world three-line element set (TLE/3LE) data for Starlink satellites from Celestrak. Our experiments, conducted using the D-Wave Advantage annealer and the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi, demonstrate that the quantum annealer significantly outperforms classical methods in terms of runtime while maintaining the solution quality. The performance achieved with quantum annealers surpasses the capabilities of classical computers, highlighting the transformative potential of quantum computing in optimizing the management of large-scale satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Traffic Assignment for Public Transport with Vehicle Capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic assignment is a core component of many urban transport planning tools. It is used to determine how traffic is distributed over a transportation network. We study the task of computing traffic assignments for public transport: Given a public transit network, a timetable, vehicle capacities and a demand (i.e. a list of passengers, each with an associated origin, destination, and departure time), the goal is to predict the resulting passenger flow and the corresponding load of each vehicle. Microscopic stochastic simulation of individual passengers is a standard, but computationally expensive approach. Briem et al. (2017) have shown that a clever adaptation of the Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA) can lead to highly efficient traffic assignment algorithms, but ignores vehicle capacities, resulting in overcrowded vehicles. Taking their work as a starting point, we here propose a new and extended model that guarantees capacity-feasible assignments and incorporates dynamic network congestion effects such as crowded vehicles, denied boarding, and dwell time delays. Moreover, we also incorporate learning and adaptation of individual passengers based on their experience with the network. Applications include studying the evolution of perceived travel times as a result of adaptation, the impact of an increase in capacity, or network effects due to changes in the timetable such as the addition or the removal of a service or a whole line. The proposed framework has been experimentally evaluated with public transport networks of G\"ottingen and Stuttgart (Germany). The simulation proves to be highly efficient. On a standard PC the computation of a traffic assignment takes just a few seconds per simulation day.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Maximum Weighted Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.05536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there have been many results on lower bounds for Max Cut in unweighted graphs, there are only few results for lower bounds for Max Cut in weighted graphs. In this paper, we launch an extensive study of lower bounds for Max Cut in weighted graphs. We introduce a new approach for obtaining lower bounds for Weighted Max Cut. Using it, Probabilistic Method, Vizing's chromatic index theorem, and other tools, we obtain several lower bounds for arbitrary weighted graphs, weighted graphs of bounded girth and triangle-free weighted graphs. We pose conjectures and open questions.</description>

      <title>Some Remarks on Palindromic Periodicities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say a finite word $x$ is a palindromic periodicity if there exist two palindromes $p$ and $s$ such that $|x| \geq |ps|$ and $x$ is a prefix of the word $(ps)^\omega = pspsps\cdots$. In this paper we examine the palindromic periodicities occurring in some classical infinite words, such as Sturmian words, episturmian words, the Thue-Morse word, the period-doubling word, the Rudin-Shapiro word, the paperfolding word, and the Tribonacci word, and prove a number of results about them. We also prove results about words with the smallest number of palindromic periodicities.</description>

      <title>Various Properties of Various Ultrafilters, Various Graph Width Parameters, and Various Connectivity Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filters are collections of sets that are closed under supersets and finite intersections, serving as fundamental tools in topology and set theory. An ultrafilter, a maximal filter on a set, plays a crucial role in these fields by rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X,f) , where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters elucidates the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth, enhancing our understanding of these mathematical structures.</description>
