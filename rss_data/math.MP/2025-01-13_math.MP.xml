      <title>Skein Construction of Balanced Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of tensor categories has found applications across various fields, including representation theory, quantum field theory (conformal in 2 dimensions, and topological in 3 and 4 dimensions), quantum invariants of low-dimensional objects, topological phases of matter, and topological quantum computation. In essence, it is a categorification of the classical theory of algebras and modules. In this analogy, the Deligne tensor product $\boxtimes$ is to the linear tensor $\otimes_{\mathbb{C}}$ as the balanced tensor product $\boxtimes_C$ is to the tensor over algebra $\otimes_A$, where $\mathbb{C}$ is a field, $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra, and $C$ is a tensor category.
  Before this work, several algebraic constructions for balanced tensor products were known, including categories of modules, internal Hom spaces, and generalized categorical centers. In this paper, we introduce a topological construction based on skein theory that offers a better mix of algebra and topology. This approach not only works for products of multiple module categories, but also provides the missing key to proving that the Turaev-Viro state sum model naturally arises from the 3-functor in the classification of fully extended field theories. Building on this result, we establish this long-anticipated proof in an upcoming work.</description>

      <title>A primer of the complex WKB method, with application to the ODE/IM correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05957v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these lectures, we provide an introduction to the complex WKB method, using as a guiding example a class of anharmonic oscillators that appears in the ODE/IM correspondence. In the first three lectures, we introduce the main objects of the method, such as the WKB function, the integral equations of Volterra type, the quadratic differential and its horizontal/Stokes lines, the Stokes phenomenon, the notion of asymptotic values, the Fock-Goncharov coordinates and their WKB approximation. In the fourth and last lecture, we compute (and prove) the asymptotic behaviour of the spectrum of the anharmonic oscillators in two asymptotic regimes, when the momentum is fixed and the energy is large, and when the momentum (hence also the energy) is large.</description>

      <title>Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to the changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), introducing quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP or EGUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of GEUP on the analogue of the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within the classical limit of non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted phase space volume element, invariant under the infinitesimal time evolution, in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how GEUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties. Special cases, obtained in certain limits from the above models are discussed. New higher order types of GEUP and EUP are also proposed.</description>

      <title>Casimir Effect of rough plates under a magnetic field in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Casimir effect for parallel plates within the framework of Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz theory in $3+1$ dimensions, considering the effects of roughness, anisotropic scaling factor, and an uniform constant magnetic field. Quantum fluctuations are induced by an anisotropic charged-scalar quantum field subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions. To incorporate surface roughness, we apply a coordinate transformation to flatten the plates, treating the remaining roughness terms as potential. The spectrum is derived using perturbation theory and regularized with the $\zeta$-function method. As an illustrative example, we consider plates with periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithmic way to calculate the degree growth of birational mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithmic method for the calculation of the degrees of the iterates of birational mappings, based on Halburd's method for obtaining the degrees from the singularity structure of the mapping. The method uses only integer arithmetic with additions and, in some cases, multiplications by small integers. It is therefore extremely fast. Several examples of integrable and non-integrable mappings are presented. In the latter case the dynamical degree we obtain from our method is always in agreement with that calculated by previously known methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, under Dubrovin's notion of ''almost'' duality, the Frobenius manifold structure on the orbit spaces of the extended affine Weyl groups of type $\mathrm{ADE}$ is dual, for suitable choices of weight markings, to the equivariant quantum cohomology of the minimal resolution of the du Val singularity of the same Dynkin type. We also provide a uniform Lie-theoretic construction of Landau-Ginzburg mirrors for the quantum cohomology of $\mathrm{ADE}$ resolutions. The mirror B-model is described by a one-dimensional LG superpotential associated to the spectral curve of the $\widehat{\mathrm{ADE}}$ affine relativistic Toda chain.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the theory of JT supergravity, Stanford-Witten derived a remarkable recursion formula of Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli space of super Riemann surfaces. It is the super version of the celebrated Mirzakhani's recursion formula. In this paper, we generalize Stanford-Witten's formula to include high degree kappa classes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamic spreading of a dense overdamped suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials, often called Riesz gases. That is, potentials that decay with distance as 1/r^k where k\in (-2,\infty]. Depending on the value of k relative to the system's spatial dimension $D$, the potentials are categorized as short-ranged for k &gt; D, and long-ranged when $k \leq D$. Such systems naturally occur in contexts involving particle suspensions, granular media, and charged systems, where interactions can be influenced by physical fields that decrease over distance. Our analytical findings reveal that the particles spread in a self-similar form, with the radius growing with time as t^1/(k+2). The theoretical predictions derived for a general dimension D, are verified by numerical simulations involving thousands of particles in free space, in both one and two dimensions. Furthermore, the simulations not only confirm our analytical results but also reveal a rich diversity of behaviors depending on the value of k. We demonstrate that the density profiles differ significantly depending on whether k is larger than, smaller than, or equal to D-2, where D is the dimension. For k&gt;D-2 the density is centered in the middle and we also notice a Wigner lattice emerging as a result of the repulsive interactions, for k = D-2, density is uniform and for k&lt;D-2, density is centered at the edges. This new classification indicates that the long/short-range classification is insufficient for predicting the density profile of the suspension. When k&lt;D-2, we observed an interesting phenomenon when two or more suspensions are placed near each other: a particle-free zone is formed where the two populations meet, resembling structures of bubbles.</description>

      <title>Maximality of the futures of points in globally hyperbolic maximal conformally flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a globally hyperbolic conformally spacetime. We prove that the indecomposable past/future sets (abbrev. IPs/IFs) -- in the sense of Penrose, Kronheimer and Geroch -- of the universal cover of $M$ are domains of injectivity of the developing map. This relies on the central observation that diamonds are domains of injectivity of the developing map. Using this, we provide a new proof of a result of completeness by C. Rossi, which notably simplifies the original arguments. Furthermore, we establish that if, in addition, $M$ is maximal, the IPs/IFs are maximal as globally hyperbolic conformally flat spacetimes. More precisely, we show that they are conformally equivalent to regular domains of Minkowski spacetime as defined by F. Bonsante.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speedup for Nonreversible Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms can potentially solve a handful of problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. In that context, it has been discussed that Markov chains problems could be solved significantly faster using quantum computing. Indeed, previous work suggests that quantum computers could accelerate sampling from the stationary distribution of reversible Markov chains. However, in practice, certain physical processes of interest are nonreversible in the probabilistic sense and reversible Markov chains can sometimes be replaced by more efficient nonreversible chains targeting the same stationary distribution. This study uses modern quantum algorithmic techniques and Markov chain theory to sample from the stationary distribution of nonreversible Markov chains with faster worst-case runtime and without requiring the stationary distribution to be computed up to a multiplicative constant. Such an up-to-exponential quantum speedup goes beyond the predicted quadratic quantum acceleration for reversible chains and is likely to have a decisive impact on many applications ranging from statistics and machine learning to computational modeling in physics, chemistry, biology and finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-time and two-time correlators are computed exactly in the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model after a quench to zero temperature and on a periodic chain of finite length $N$, using a simple analytical continuation technique. Besides the general confirmation of finite-size scaling in non-equilibrium dynamics, this allows to test the scaling behaviour of the plateau height $C_{\infty}^{(2)}$ to which the two-time auto-correlator converges, when deep into the finite-size regime.</description>

Abstract: We will argue in this paper that the type classification of v.Neumann algebras play an important role in a theory of quantum gravity and quantum space-time physics. We provide arguments that type $II_{\infty}$ and its representation as a tensor product of an ordinary (exterior) Hilbert space algebra $\cB(\cH_I)$ and an (internal) type $II_1$ algebra, encoding, in our view, the hidden microscopic gravitational degrees of freedom, do represent the first step away from the semiclassical picture towards a full theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Exploring Metastability in Ising models: critical droplets, energy barriers and exit time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the research on the metastable behavior of the Ising model. We analyze the transition times from the set of metastable states to the set of the stable states by identifying the critical configurations that the system crosses with high probability during this transition and by computing the energy barrier that the system must overcome to reach the stable state starting from the metastable one. We describe the dynamical phase transition of the Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics across various contexts, including different lattices, dimensions and anisotropic variants. The analysis is extended to related models, such as long-range Ising model, Blume-Capel and Potts models, as well as to dynamics like Kawasaki dynamics, providing insights into metastability across different systems.</description>

      <title>Algebraic solutions for $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems: generic statistical ensembles and a mesoscopic system application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solutions of generic $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonian eigensystems are obtained through systematic manipulations of quartic polynomial equations. An {\em ansatz} for constructing separable and entangled eigenstate basis, depending on the quartic equation coefficients, is proposed. Besides the quantum concurrence for pure entangled states, the associated thermodynamic statistical ensembles, their partition function, quantum purity and quantum concurrence are shown to be straightforwardly obtained. Results are specialized to a $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ structure emulated by lattice-layer degrees of freedom of the Bernal stacked graphene, in a context that can be extended to several mesoscopic scale systems for which the onset from $SU(2)\otimes SU(2)$ Hamiltonians has been assumed.</description>

      <title>Generalized Positive Energy Representations of the Group of Compactly Supported Diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by asymptotic symmetry groups in general relativity, we consider projective unitary representations $\overline{\rho}$ of the Lie group $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)$ of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold $M$ that satisfy a so-called generalized positive energy condition. In particular, this captures representations that are in a suitable sense compatible with a KMS state on the von Neumann algebra generated by $\overline{\rho}$. We show that if $M$ is connected and $\dim(M) &gt; 1$, then any such representation is necessarily trivial on the identity component $\mathrm{Diff}_c(M)_0$. As an intermediate step towards this result, we determine the continuous second Lie algebra cohomology $H^2_{\mathrm{ct}}(\mathcal{X}_c(M), \mathbb{R})$ of the Lie algebra of compactly supported vector fields. This is subtly different from Gelfand--Fuks cohomology in view of the compact support condition.</description>

      <title>Existence of long-range order in random-field Ising model on Dyson hierarchical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the random-field Ising model on a Dyson hierarchical lattice, where the interactions decay in a power-law-like form, $J(r)\sim r^{-\alpha}$, with respect to the distance. Without a random field, the Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice has a long-range order at finite low temperatures when $1&lt;\alpha&lt;2$. In this study, for $1&lt;\alpha&lt;3/2$, we rigorously prove that there is a long-range order in the random-field Ising model on the Dyson hierarchical lattice at finite low temperatures, including zero temperature, when the strength of the random field is sufficiently small but nonzero. Our proof is based on Dyson's method for the case without a random field, and the concentration inequalities in probability theory enable us to evaluate the effect of a random field.</description>

      <title>Symplectic cuts and open/closed strings I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07329v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a concrete relation between genus zero closed Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau threefolds and genus zero open Gromov-Witten invariants of a Lagrangian $A$-brane in the same threefold. Symplectic cutting is a natural operation that decomposes a symplectic manifold $(X,\omega)$ with a Hamiltonian $U(1)$ action into two pieces glued along an invariant divisor. In this paper we study a quantum uplift of the cut construction defined in terms of equivariant gauged linear sigma models. The nexus between closed and open Gromov-Witten invariants is a quantum Lebesgue measure associated to a choice of cut, that we introduce and study. Integration of this measure recovers the equivariant quantum volume of the whole CY3, thereby encoding closed Gromov-Witten invariants. Conversely, the monodromies of the quantum measure around cycles in K\"ahler moduli space encode open Gromov-Witten invariants of a Lagrangian $A$-brane associated to the cut. Both in the closed and the open string sector we find a remarkable interplay between worldsheet instantons and semiclassical volumes regularized by equivariance. This leads to equivariant generating functions of GW invariants that extend smoothly across the entire moduli space, and which provide a unifying description of standard GW potentials. The latter are recovered in the non-equivariant limit in each of the different phases of the geometry.</description>

      <title>On the optimal relaxation rate for the Metropolis algorithm in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm corresponding to a single particle trapped in a one-dimensional confining potential, with even jump distributions that ensure that the dynamics verifies detailed balance. Previous work suggested that, for smooth jump distributions, the fastest relaxation rate is obtained as a result of the competition between diffusive and rejection-dominated dynamics. In this work, we show that a new regime comes into play for two-peaked jump distributions, where the relaxation dynamics is neither dominated by diffusion nor rejection: the eigenmodes adopt an oscillatory form, reminiscent of charge density waves (CDW) -- thus we term this new regime the CDW regime. Using a combination of numerical and analytical techniques, the parameter regions corresponding to diffusion, rejection, and CDW are characterised, as well as the transition lines between them -- i.e. a phase diagram is built. The optimal relaxation rate is located at the triple point of phase coexistence, where the transition lines (diffusive-rejection, diffusive-CDW, and CDW-rejection) intersect. Our theoretical framework is checked versus the numerical diagonalisation of the master equation. We also briefly discuss more sophisticated attempts at optimising the relaxation rate to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>New lower bounds for the (near) critical Ising and $\varphi^4$ models' two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nearest-neighbour Ising and $\varphi^4$ models on $\mathbb Z^d$ with $d\geq 3$ and obtain new lower bounds on their two-point functions at (and near) criticality. Together with the classical infrared bound, these bounds turn into up-to constant estimates when $d\geq 5$. When $d=4$, we obtain an ''almost'' sharp lower bound corrected by a logarithmic factor. As a consequence of these results, we show that $\eta=0$ and $\nu=1/2$ when $d\geq 4$, where $\eta$ is the critical exponent associated with the decay of the model's two-point function at criticality and $\nu$ is the critical exponent of the correlation length $\xi(\beta)$. When $d=3$, we improve previous results and obtain that $\eta\leq 1/2$. As a byproduct of our proofs, we also derive the blow-up at criticality of the so-called bubble diagram when $d=3,4$.</description>

      <title>A BGK-type model for multi-component gas mixtures undergoing a bimolecular chemical reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new kinetic BGK-type model for a mixture of four monatomic gases, undergoing a bimolecular and reversible chemical reaction. The elastic and reactive interactions are described separately by distinct relaxation terms and the mechanical operator is the sum of binary BGK contributions, one for each pair of interacting species. In this way, our model separately incorporates the effects of mechanical processes and chemical reactions. Additionally, it retains the effects of inter-species interactions which are proper of the mixture. The dependence of Maxwellian attractors on the main macroscopic fields is explicitly expressed by assuming that the exchange rates for momentum and energy of mechanical and chemical operators coincide with the ones of the corresponding Boltzmann terms. Under suitable hypotheses, the relaxation of the distribution functions to equilibrium is shown through entropy dissipation. Some numerical simulations are included to investigate the trend to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>eGAD! double descent is explained by Generalized Aliasing Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counterintuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. Others may exhibit more complicated patterns of predictive error with multiple peaks and valleys. Neither double descent nor multiple descent phenomena are well explained by the bias-variance decomposition.
  We introduce a novel decomposition that we call the generalized aliasing decomposition (GAD) to explain the relationship between predictive performance and model complexity. The GAD decomposes the predictive error into three parts: 1) model insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much smaller than the number of data points, 2) data insufficiency, which dominates when the number of parameters is much greater than the number of data points, and 3) generalized aliasing, which dominates between these two extremes.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the GAD to diverse applications, including random feature models from machine learning, Fourier transforms from signal processing, solution methods for differential equations, and predictive formation enthalpy in materials discovery. Because key components of the GAD can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We further demonstrate this approach on several examples and discuss implications for predictive modeling and data science.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Wave Localisation in Systems of Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the dynamics of metamaterials composed of high-contrast subwavelength resonators and show the existence of localised modes in such a setting. A crucial assumption in this paper is time-modulated material parameters. We prove a so-called capacitance matrix approximation of the wave equation in the form of an ordinary differential equation. These formulas set the ground for the derivation of a first-principles characterisation of localised modes in terms of the generalised capacitance matrix. Furthermore, we provide numerical results supporting our analytical results showing for the first time the phenomenon of space-time localised waves in a perturbed time-modulated metamaterial. Such spatio-temporal localisation is only possible in the presence of subwavelength resonances in the unperturbed structure. We introduce the time-dependent degree of localisation to quantitatively determine the localised modes and provide a variety of numerical experiments to illustrate our formulations and results.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Approaches to Cosmological Integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode statistical properties of the initial conditions of our universe. Mathematically, they can often be written as Mellin integrals of a certain rational function associated to graphs, namely the flat space wavefunction. The singularities of these cosmological integrals are parameterized by binary hyperplane arrangements. Using different algebraic tools, we shed light on the differential and difference equations satisfied by these integrals. Moreover, we study a multivariate version of partial fractioning of the flat space wavefunction, and propose a graph-based algorithm to compute this decomposition.</description>
