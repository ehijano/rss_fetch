      <title>The phenomenological renormalization group in neuronal models near criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) has been applied to the study of scaleinvariant phenomena in neuronal data, providing evidence for critical phenomena in the brain. However, it remains unclear how reliably these observed signatures indicate genuine critical behavior, as it is not well established how close to criticality a system must be for them to emerge. Here, we rely on neuronal models with known critical points to investigate under which conditions the PRG procedure yields consistent results. We discuss how the time-binning step of data preprocessing can crucially affect the final results, and propose a data-driven method to adapt the time bin in order to circumvent this issue. Under these conditions, the PRG method only detects scaling behavior in neuronal models within a very narrow range of the critical point, lending credence to the conclusions drawn from PRG results in experimental data.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in AI-driven Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In this work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.</description>

      <title>Predicting the response of structurally altered and asymmetrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the response of coupled dynamical systems is modified due to a structural alteration of the interaction. The majority of the literature focuses on additive perturbations and symmetrical interaction networks. Here, we consider the challenging problem of multiplicative perturbations and asymmetrical interaction coupling. We introduce a framework to approximate the averaged response at each network node for general structural perturbations, including non-normal and asymmetrical ones. Our findings indicate that both the asymmetry and non-normality of the structural perturbation impact the global and local responses at different orders in time. We propose a set of matrices to identify the nodes whose response is affected the most by the structural alteration.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary chemical learning in dimerization networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for chemical learning based on Competitive Dimerization Networks (CDNs) - systems in which multiple molecular species, e.g. proteins or DNA/RNA oligomers, reversibly bind to form dimers. We show that these networks can be trained in vitro through directed evolution, enabling the implementation of complex learning tasks such as multiclass classification without digital hardware or explicit parameter tuning. Each molecular species functions analogously to a neuron, with binding affinities acting as tunable synaptic weights. A training protocol involving mutation, selection, and amplification of DNA-based components allows CDNs to robustly discriminate among noisy input patterns. The resulting classifiers exhibit strong output contrast and high mutual information between input and output, especially when guided by a contrast-enhancing loss function. Comparative analysis with in silico gradient descent training reveals closely correlated performance. These results establish CDNs as a promising platform for analog physical computation, bridging synthetic biology and machine learning, and advancing the development of adaptive, energy-efficient molecular computing systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting local topology with the spectral localizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral localizer is a predictive framework for the computation of topological invariants of natural and artificial materials. Here, three crucial improvements on the criterion for the validity of the framework are reported: first, merely a properly defined local spectral gap of the Hamiltonian is required, second, only relative bounds on the Hamiltonian and its noncommutative derivative are relevant, and, third, the numerical constant in a tapering estimate is improved. These developments further stress the local nature of the spectral localizer framework, enabling more precise predictions in heterostructures, aperiodic, and disordered systems. Moreover, these results strengthen the bounds on the spectral localizer's spectral flow when crossing topological phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>A novel approach for converting spatio-temporal series into complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to offer a new perspective on complex network representation of real-world systems. Currently, the most well-known transformation algorithms in the literature treat each data point in a time series as a node and transform the time series into a network. In this study, we present a new approach converting spatio-temporal series into a complex network. We focus on studying this transformation by grounding it in the context of physics , with the aim of adapting it to real-world problems, which often manifest as complex systems across various domains. We introduce the Gravitational Graph (GG) algorithm, which is grounded in the concept of gravitational force from fundamental physics. We consider air pollution concentrations, which represent a global environmental health risk, as an example of a complex environmental system, and apply the GG algorithm to particulate matter of 10 microns (PM10) recorded by 21 air quality monitoring stations located in various regions of Istanbul, Turkiye. While the GG algorithm allows for the conversion of spatio-temporal series -- rather than time series -- into networks, it also enables the analysis of the statistical properties and characteristics of the converted networks, thereby uncovering hidden relationships and dependencies that may not be apparent in the original time series.</description>

      <title>Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Suzuki-Kubo Mean-field Ising Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local magnetizations $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remains (in an effective adiabatic way) close to a low energy configuration as the magnitudes of $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. While the configuration reached by the procedure is not the ground state, for an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ found by the annealing procedure scales as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7629\pm 0.0002$, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit the energy per spin of the low energy configurations converges to the ground state of the SK model (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.</description>

      <title>Efficient optimization of neural network backflow for ab-initio quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground state of second-quantized quantum chemistry Hamiltonians is key to determining molecular properties. Neural quantum states (NQS) offer flexible and expressive wavefunction ansatze for this task but face two main challenges: highly peaked ground-state wavefunctions hinder efficient sampling, and local energy evaluations scale quartically with system size, incurring significant computational costs. In this work, we overcome these challenges by introducing a suite of algorithmic enhancements, which includes efficient periodic compact subspace construction, truncated local energy evaluations, improved stochastic sampling, and physics-informed modifications.
  Applying these techniques to the neural network backflow (NNBF) ansatz, we demonstrate significant gains in both accuracy and scalability. Our enhanced method surpasses traditional quantum chemistry methods like CCSD and CCSD(T), outperforms other NQS approaches, and achieves competitive energies with state-of-the-art ab initio techniques such as HCI, ASCI, FCIQMC, and DMRG. A series of ablation and comparative studies quantifies the contribution of each enhancement to the observed improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we investigate the representational capacity of the ansatz, finding that its performance correlates with the inverse participation ratio (IPR), with more delocalized states being more challenging to approximate.</description>

      <title>Localization in the Dirac spectrum and gauge-field topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study localization of the low Dirac modes in 3+1 dimensional pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory at zero and nonzero imaginary $\theta$ angle, with the aim of better characterizing the relation between low-mode localization and topological features of gauge theories. We show that the mobility edge observed in the deconfined phase at $\theta=0$ is present also at nonzero $\theta$, appearing exactly at the deconfinement transition. We find that the mobility edge is affected by topology only indirectly, through its effects on the ordering of the Polyakov loop. Moreover, the change in the mobility edge is strongly correlated with the change in the Polyakov-loop expectation value, both as one moves along the critical line, and as one departs from it toward higher temperatures. This further strengthens the connection between low-mode localization and deconfinement, showing in particular the key role played by the ordering of the Polyakov loop.</description>
