      <title>Correspondence of NNGP Kernel and the Matern Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernels representing limiting cases of neural network architectures have recently gained popularity. However, the application and performance of these new kernels compared to existing options, such as the Matern kernel, is not well studied. We take a practical approach to explore the neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) kernel and its application to data in Gaussian process regression. We first demonstrate the necessity of normalization to produce valid NNGP kernels and explore related numerical challenges. We further demonstrate that the predictions from this model are quite inflexible, and therefore do not vary much over the valid hyperparameter sets. We then demonstrate a surprising result that the predictions given from the NNGP kernel correspond closely to those given by the Matern kernel under specific circumstances, which suggests a deep similarity between overparameterized deep neural networks and the Matern kernel. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the NNGP kernel as compared to the Matern kernel on three benchmark data cases, and we conclude that for its flexibility and practical performance, the Matern kernel is preferred to the novel NNGP in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Avoiding mode collapse in diffusion models fine-tuned with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning foundation models via reinforcement learning (RL) has proven promising for aligning to downstream objectives. In the case of diffusion models (DMs), though RL training improves alignment from early timesteps, critical issues such as training instability and mode collapse arise. We address these drawbacks by exploiting the hierarchical nature of DMs: we train them dynamically at each epoch with a tailored RL method, allowing for continual evaluation and step-by-step refinement of the model performance (or alignment). Furthermore, we find that not every denoising step needs to be fine-tuned to align DMs to downstream tasks. Consequently, in addition to clipping, we regularise model parameters at distinct learning phases via a sliding-window approach. Our approach, termed Hierarchical Reward Fine-tuning (HRF), is validated on the Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimisation method, where we show that models trained with HRF achieve better preservation of diversity in downstream tasks, thus enhancing the fine-tuning robustness and at uncompromising mean rewards.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds for Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces for Orbits of an Iterated Function System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key problems in learning theory is to compute a function $f$ that closely approximates the relationship between some input $x$ and corresponding output $y$, such that $y\approx f(x)$. This approximation is based on sample points $(x_t,y_t)_{t=1}^{m}$, where the function $f$ can be approximated within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces using various learning algorithms. In the context of learning theory, it is usually customary to assume that the sample points are drawn independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from an unknown underlying distribution. However, we relax this i.i.d. assumption by considering an input sequence $(x_t)_{t\in {\mathbb N}}$ as a trajectory generated by an iterated function system, which forms a particular Markov chain, with $(y_t)_{t\in {\mathbb N}}$ corresponding to an observation sequence when the model is in the corresponding state $x_t$. For such a process, we approximate the function $f$ using the Markov chain stochastic gradient algorithm and estimate the error by deriving upper bounds within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>SOAK: Same/Other/All K-fold cross-validation for estimating similarity of patterns in data subsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of machine learning, we are interested to know if it is possible to train on the data that we have gathered so far, and obtain accurate predictions on a new test data subset that is qualitatively different in some respect (time period, geographic region, etc). Another question is whether data subsets are similar enough so that it is beneficial to combine subsets during model training. We propose SOAK, Same/Other/All K-fold cross-validation, a new method which can be used to answer both questions. SOAK systematically compares models which are trained on different subsets of data, and then used for prediction on a fixed test subset, to estimate the similarity of learnable/predictable patterns in data subsets. We show results of using SOAK on six new real data sets (with geographic/temporal subsets, to check if predictions are accurate on new subsets), 3 image pair data sets (subsets are different image types, to check that we get smaller prediction error on similar images), and 11 benchmark data sets with predefined train/test splits (to check similarity of predefined splits).</description>

      <title>Losing dimensions: Geometric memorization in generative diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative diffusion processes are state-of-the-art machine learning models deeply connected with fundamental concepts in statistical physics. Depending on the dataset size and the capacity of the network, their behavior is known to transition from an associative memory regime to a generalization phase in a phenomenon that has been described as a glassy phase transition. Here, using statistical physics techniques, we extend the theory of memorization in generative diffusion to manifold-supported data. Our theoretical and experimental findings indicate that different tangent subspaces are lost due to memorization effects at different critical times and dataset sizes, which depend on the local variance of the data along their directions. Perhaps counterintuitively, we find that, under some conditions, subspaces of higher variance are lost first due to memorization effects. This leads to a selective loss of dimensionality where some prominent features of the data are memorized without a full collapse on any individual training point. We validate our theory with a comprehensive set of experiments on networks trained both in image datasets and on linear manifolds, which result in a remarkable qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Computation-Aware Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes are notorious for scaling cubically with the size of the training set, preventing application to very large regression problems. Computation-aware Gaussian processes (CAGPs) tackle this scaling issue by exploiting probabilistic linear solvers to reduce complexity, widening the posterior with additional computational uncertainty due to reduced computation. However, the most commonly used CAGP framework results in (sometimes dramatically) conservative uncertainty quantification, making the posterior unrealistic in practice. In this work, we prove that if the utilised probabilistic linear solver is calibrated, in a rigorous statistical sense, then so too is the induced CAGP. We thus propose a new CAGP framework, CAGP-GS, based on using Gauss-Seidel iterations for the underlying probabilistic linear solver. CAGP-GS performs favourably compared to existing approaches when the test set is low-dimensional and few iterations are performed. We test the calibratedness on a synthetic problem, and compare the performance to existing approaches on a large-scale global temperature regression problem.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Personalization in FedProx: A Fine-grained Analysis on Statistical Accuracy and Communication Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FedProx is a simple yet effective federated learning method that enables model personalization via regularization. Despite remarkable success in practice, a rigorous analysis of how such a regularization provably improves the statistical accuracy of each client's local model hasn't been fully established. Setting the regularization strength heuristically presents a risk, as an inappropriate choice may even degrade accuracy. This work fills in the gap by analyzing the effect of regularization on statistical accuracy, thereby providing a theoretical guideline for setting the regularization strength for achieving personalization. We prove that by adaptively choosing the regularization strength under different statistical heterogeneity, FedProx can consistently outperform pure local training and achieve a nearly minimax-optimal statistical rate. In addition, to shed light on resource allocation, we design an algorithm, provably showing that stronger personalization reduces communication complexity without increasing the computation cost overhead. Finally, our theory is validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets and its generalizability is verified in a non-convex setting.</description>

      <title>Lifted Coefficient of Determination: Fast model-free prediction intervals and likelihood-free model comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the $\textit{lifted linear model}$, and derive model-free prediction intervals that become tighter as the correlation between predictions and observations increases. These intervals motivate the $\textit{Lifted Coefficient of Determination}$, a model comparison criterion for arbitrary loss functions in prediction-based settings, e.g., regression, classification or counts. We extend the prediction intervals to more general error distributions, and propose a fast model-free outlier detection algorithm for regression. Finally, we illustrate the framework via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Online-to-PAC generalization bounds under graph-mixing dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional generalization results in statistical learning require a training data set made of independently drawn examples. Most of the recent efforts to relax this independence assumption have considered either purely temporal (mixing) dependencies, or graph-dependencies, where non-adjacent vertices correspond to independent random variables. Both approaches have their own limitations, the former requiring a temporal ordered structure, and the latter lacking a way to quantify the strength of inter-dependencies. In this work, we bridge these two lines of work by proposing a framework where dependencies decay with graph distance. We derive generalization bounds leveraging the online-to-PAC framework, by deriving a concentration result and introducing an online learning framework incorporating the graph structure. The resulting high-probability generalization guarantees depend on both the mixing rate and the graph's chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Optimal Downsampling for Imbalanced Classification with Generalized Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Downsampling or under-sampling is a technique that is utilized in the context of large and highly imbalanced classification models. We study optimal downsampling for imbalanced classification using generalized linear models (GLMs). We propose a pseudo maximum likelihood estimator and study its asymptotic normality in the context of increasingly imbalanced populations relative to an increasingly large sample size. We provide theoretical guarantees for the introduced estimator. Additionally, we compute the optimal downsampling rate using a criterion that balances statistical accuracy and computational efficiency. Our numerical experiments, conducted on both synthetic and empirical data, further validate our theoretical results, and demonstrate that the introduced estimator outperforms commonly available alternatives.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Neural Scaling Laws in Two-Layer Networks with Power-Law Data Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws describe how the performance of deep neural networks scales with key factors such as training data size, model complexity, and training time, often following power-law behaviors over multiple orders of magnitude. Despite their empirical observation, the theoretical understanding of these scaling laws remains limited. In this work, we employ techniques from statistical mechanics to analyze one-pass stochastic gradient descent within a student-teacher framework, where both the student and teacher are two-layer neural networks. Our study primarily focuses on the generalization error and its behavior in response to data covariance matrices that exhibit power-law spectra. For linear activation functions, we derive analytical expressions for the generalization error, exploring different learning regimes and identifying conditions under which power-law scaling emerges. Additionally, we extend our analysis to non-linear activation functions in the feature learning regime, investigating how power-law spectra in the data covariance matrix impact learning dynamics. Importantly, we find that the length of the symmetric plateau depends on the number of distinct eigenvalues of the data covariance matrix and the number of hidden units, demonstrating how these plateaus behave under various configurations. In addition, our results reveal a transition from exponential to power-law convergence in the specialized phase when the data covariance matrix possesses a power-law spectrum. This work contributes to the theoretical understanding of neural scaling laws and provides insights into optimizing learning performance in practical scenarios involving complex data structures.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Diffusion Models Under the Manifold Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-matching generative models have proven successful at sampling from complex high-dimensional data distributions. In many applications, this distribution is believed to concentrate on a much lower $d$-dimensional manifold embedded into $D$-dimensional space; this is known as the manifold hypothesis. The current best-known convergence guarantees are either linear in $D$ or polynomial (superlinear) in $d$. The latter exploits a novel integration scheme for the backward SDE. We take the best of both worlds and show that the number of steps diffusion models require in order to converge in Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence is linear (up to logarithmic terms) in the intrinsic dimension $d$. Moreover, we show that this linear dependency is sharp.</description>

      <title>EarthquakeNPP: Benchmark Datasets for Earthquake Forecasting with Neural Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical point process models, such as the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, have been widely used for forecasting the event times and locations of earthquakes for decades. Recent advances have led to Neural Point Processes (NPPs), which promise greater flexibility and improvements over classical models. However, the currently-used benchmark dataset for NPPs does not represent an up-to-date challenge in the seismological community since it lacks a key earthquake sequence from the region and improperly splits training and testing data. Furthermore, initial earthquake forecast benchmarking lacks a comparison to state-of-the-art earthquake forecasting models typically used by the seismological community. To address these gaps, we introduce EarthquakeNPP: a collection of benchmark datasets to facilitate testing of NPPs on earthquake data, accompanied by a credible implementation of the ETAS model. The datasets cover a range of small to large target regions within California, dating from 1971 to 2021, and include different methodologies for dataset generation. In a benchmarking experiment, we compare three spatio-temporal NPPs against ETAS and find that none outperform ETAS in either spatial or temporal log-likelihood. These results indicate that current NPP implementations are not yet suitable for practical earthquake forecasting. However, EarthquakeNPP will serve as a platform for collaboration between the seismology and machine learning communities with the goal of improving earthquake predictability.</description>

      <title>Can Looped Transformers Learn to Implement Multi-step Gradient Descent for In-context Learning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable capability of Transformers to do reasoning and few-shot learning, without any fine-tuning, is widely conjectured to stem from their ability to implicitly simulate a multi-step algorithms -- such as gradient descent -- with their weights in a single forward pass. Recently, there has been progress in understanding this complex phenomenon from an expressivity point of view, by demonstrating that Transformers can express such multi-step algorithms. However, our knowledge about the more fundamental aspect of its learnability, beyond single layer models, is very limited. In particular, can training Transformers enable convergence to algorithmic solutions? In this work we resolve this for in-context linear regression with linear looped Transformers -- a multi-layer model with weight sharing that is conjectured to have an inductive bias to learn fix-point iterative algorithms. More specifically, for this setting we show that the global minimizer of the population training loss implements multi-step preconditioned gradient descent, with a preconditioner that adapts to the data distribution. Furthermore, we show a fast convergence for gradient flow on the regression loss, despite the non-convexity of the landscape, by proving a novel gradient dominance condition. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis for multi-layer Transformer in this setting. We further validate our theoretical findings through synthetic experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Concept Learning and Compositional Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior work has shown that text-conditioned diffusion models can learn to identify and manipulate primitive concepts underlying a compositional data-generating process, enabling generalization to entirely novel, out-of-distribution compositions. Beyond performance evaluations, these studies develop a rich empirical phenomenology of learning dynamics, showing that models generalize sequentially, respecting the compositional hierarchy of the data-generating process. Moreover, concept-centric structures within the data significantly influence a model's speed of learning the ability to manipulate a concept. In this paper, we aim to better characterize these empirical results from a theoretical standpoint. Specifically, we propose an abstraction of prior work's compositional generalization problem by introducing a structured identity mapping (SIM) task, where a model is trained to learn the identity mapping on a Gaussian mixture with structurally organized centroids. We mathematically analyze the learning dynamics of neural networks trained on this SIM task and show that, despite its simplicity, SIM's learning dynamics capture and help explain key empirical observations on compositional generalization with diffusion models identified in prior work. Our theory also offers several new insights -- e.g., we find a novel mechanism for non-monotonic learning dynamics of test loss in early phases of training. We validate our new predictions by training a text-conditioned diffusion model, bridging our simplified framework and complex generative models. Overall, this work establishes the SIM task as a meaningful theoretical abstraction of concept learning dynamics in modern generative models.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Quantile Bayes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a multivariate posterior sampling procedure through deep generative quantile learning. Simulation proceeds implicitly through a push-forward mapping that can transform i.i.d. random vector samples from the posterior. We utilize Monge-Kantorovich depth in multivariate quantiles to directly sample from Bayesian credible sets, a unique feature not offered by typical posterior sampling methods. To enhance the training of the quantile mapping, we design a neural network that automatically performs summary statistic extraction. This additional neural network structure has performance benefits, including support shrinkage (i.e., contraction of our posterior approximation) as the observation sample size increases. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on several examples where the absence of likelihood renders classical MCMC infeasible. Finally, we provide the following frequentist theoretical justifications for our quantile learning framework: {consistency of the estimated vector quantile, of the recovered posterior distribution, and of the corresponding Bayesian credible sets.</description>

      <title>Nesterov acceleration in benignly non-convex landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While momentum-based optimization algorithms are commonly used in the notoriously non-convex optimization problems of deep learning, their analysis has historically been restricted to the convex and strongly convex setting. In this article, we partially close this gap between theory and practice and demonstrate that virtually identical guarantees can be obtained in optimization problems with a `benign' non-convexity. We show that these weaker geometric assumptions are well justified in overparametrized deep learning, at least locally. Variations of this result are obtained for a continuous time model of Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent algorithm (NAG), the classical discrete time version of NAG, and versions of NAG with stochastic gradient estimates with purely additive noise and with noise that exhibits both additive and multiplicative scaling.</description>

      <title>What is Left After Distillation? How Knowledge Transfer Impacts Fairness and Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is a commonly used Deep Neural Network compression method, which often maintains overall generalization performance. However, we show that even for balanced image classification datasets, such as CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet, as many as 41% of the classes are statistically significantly affected by distillation when comparing class-wise accuracy (i.e. class bias) between a teacher/distilled student or distilled student/non-distilled student model. Changes in class bias are not necessarily an undesirable outcome when considered outside of the context of a model's usage. Using two common fairness metrics, Demographic Parity Difference (DPD) and Equalized Odds Difference (EOD) on models trained with the CelebA, Trifeature, and HateXplain datasets, our results suggest that increasing the distillation temperature improves the distilled student model's fairness -- for DPD, the distilled student even surpasses the fairness of the teacher model at high temperatures. This study highlights the uneven effects of Knowledge Distillation on certain classes and its potentially significant role in fairness, emphasizing that caution is warranted when using distilled models for sensitive application domains.</description>

      <title>Bilinear MLPs enable weight-based mechanistic interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mechanistic understanding of how MLPs do computation in deep neural networks remains elusive. Current interpretability work can extract features from hidden activations over an input dataset but generally cannot explain how MLP weights construct features. One challenge is that element-wise nonlinearities introduce higher-order interactions and make it difficult to trace computations through the MLP layer. In this paper, we analyze bilinear MLPs, a type of Gated Linear Unit (GLU) without any element-wise nonlinearity that nevertheless achieves competitive performance. Bilinear MLPs can be fully expressed in terms of linear operations using a third-order tensor, allowing flexible analysis of the weights. Analyzing the spectra of bilinear MLP weights using eigendecomposition reveals interpretable low-rank structure across toy tasks, image classification, and language modeling. We use this understanding to craft adversarial examples, uncover overfitting, and identify small language model circuits directly from the weights alone. Our results demonstrate that bilinear layers serve as an interpretable drop-in replacement for current activation functions and that weight-based interpretability is viable for understanding deep-learning models.</description>

      <title>Deeper Insights into Deep Graph Convolutional Networks: Stability and Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as powerful models for graph learning tasks, exhibiting promising performance in various domains. While their empirical success is evident, there is a growing need to understand their essential ability from a theoretical perspective. Existing theoretical research has primarily focused on the analysis of single-layer GCNs, while a comprehensive theoretical exploration of the stability and generalization of deep GCNs remains limited. In this paper, we bridge this gap by delving into the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, aiming to provide valuable insights by characterizing rigorously the associated upper bounds. Our theoretical results reveal that the stability and generalization of deep GCNs are influenced by certain key factors, such as the maximum absolute eigenvalue of the graph filter operators and the depth of the network. Our theoretical studies contribute to a deeper understanding of the stability and generalization properties of deep GCNs, potentially paving the way for developing more reliable and well-performing models.</description>

      <title>Towards Sharper Risk Bounds for Minimax Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimax problems have achieved success in machine learning such as adversarial training, robust optimization, reinforcement learning. For theoretical analysis, current optimal excess risk bounds, which are composed by generalization error and optimization error, present 1/n-rates in strongly-convex-strongly-concave (SC-SC) settings. Existing studies mainly focus on minimax problems with specific algorithms for optimization error, with only a few studies on generalization performance, which limit better excess risk bounds. In this paper, we study the generalization bounds measured by the gradients of primal functions using uniform localized convergence. We obtain a sharper high probability generalization error bound for nonconvex-strongly-concave (NC-SC) stochastic minimax problems. Furthermore, we provide dimension-independent results under Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition for the outer layer. Based on our generalization error bound, we analyze some popular algorithms such as empirical saddle point (ESP), gradient descent ascent (GDA) and stochastic gradient descent ascent (SGDA). We derive better excess primal risk bounds with further reasonable assumptions, which, to the best of our knowledge, are n times faster than exist results in minimax problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Offline Policy Learning with Observational Data from Multiple Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of using observational bandit feedback data from multiple heterogeneous data sources to learn a personalized decision policy that robustly generalizes across diverse target settings. To achieve this, we propose a minimax regret optimization objective to ensure uniformly low regret under general mixtures of the source distributions. We develop a policy learning algorithm tailored to this objective, combining doubly robust offline policy evaluation techniques and no-regret learning algorithms for minimax optimization. Our regret analysis shows that this approach achieves the minimal worst-case mixture regret up to a moderated vanishing rate of the total data across all sources. Our analysis, extensions, and experimental results demonstrate the benefits of this approach for learning robust decision policies from multiple data sources.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Regret for Unconstrained Submodular Maximization Stochastic Bandit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the online unconstrained submodular maximization problem (Online USM), in a setting with stochastic bandit feedback. In this framework, a decision-maker receives noisy rewards from a nonmonotone submodular function, taking values in a known bounded interval. This paper proposes Double-Greedy - Explore-then-Commit (DG-ETC), adapting the Double-Greedy approach from the offline and online full-information settings. DG-ETC satisfies a O(d log(dT)) problemdependent upper bound for the 1/2-approximate pseudo-regret, as well as a O(dT^{2/3}log(dT)^{1/3}) problem-free one at the same time, outperforming existing approaches. To that end, we introduce a notion of hardness for submodular functions, characterizing how difficult it is to maximize them with this type of strategy.</description>

      <title>Transformers Provably Solve Parity Efficiently with Chain of Thought</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides the first theoretical analysis of training transformers to solve complex problems by recursively generating intermediate states, analogous to fine-tuning for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. We consider training a one-layer transformer to solve the fundamental $k$-parity problem, extending the work on RNNs by Wies et al. (2023). We establish three key results: (1) any finite-precision gradient-based algorithm, without intermediate supervision, requires substantial iterations to solve parity with finite samples. (2) In contrast, when intermediate parities are incorporated into the loss function, our model can learn parity in one gradient update when aided by \emph{teacher forcing}, where ground-truth labels of the reasoning chain are provided at each generation step. (3) Even without teacher forcing, where the model must generate CoT chains end-to-end, parity can be learned efficiently if augmented data is employed to internally verify the soundness of intermediate steps. These results rigorously show that task decomposition and stepwise reasoning naturally arise from optimizing transformers with CoT; moreover, self-consistency checking can improve reasoning ability, aligning with empirical studies of CoT.</description>

      <title>Efficient line search for optimizing Area Under the ROC Curve in gradient descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are useful for evaluation in binary classification and changepoint detection, but difficult to use for learning since the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is piecewise constant (gradient zero almost everywhere). Recently the Area Under Min (AUM) of false positive and false negative rates has been proposed as a differentiable surrogate for AUC. In this paper we study the piecewise linear/constant nature of the AUM/AUC, and propose new efficient path-following algorithms for choosing the learning rate which is optimal for each step of gradient descent (line search), when optimizing a linear model. Remarkably, our proposed line search algorithm has the same log-linear asymptotic time complexity as gradient descent with constant step size, but it computes a complete representation of the AUM/AUC as a function of step size. In our empirical study of binary classification problems, we verify that our proposed algorithm is fast and exact; in changepoint detection problems we show that the proposed algorithm is just as accurate as grid search, but faster.</description>

      <title>Distillation of Discrete Diffusion through Dimensional Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional performances in various fields of generative modeling. While they often outperform competitors including VAEs and GANs in sample quality and diversity, they suffer from slow sampling speed due to their iterative nature. Recently, distillation techniques and consistency models are mitigating this issue in continuous domains, but discrete diffusion models have some specific challenges towards faster generation. Most notably, in the current literature, correlations between different dimensions (pixels, locations) are ignored, both by its modeling and loss functions, due to computational limitations. In this paper, we propose "mixture" models in discrete diffusion that are capable of treating dimensional correlations while remaining scalable, and we provide a set of loss functions for distilling the iterations of existing models. Two primary theoretical insights underpin our approach: first, that dimensionally independent models can well approximate the data distribution if they are allowed to conduct many sampling steps, and second, that our loss functions enables mixture models to distill such many-step conventional models into just a few steps by learning the dimensional correlations. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method for discrete diffusions work in practice, by distilling a continuous-time discrete diffusion model pretrained on the CIFAR-10 dataset.</description>

      <title>Preferential Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eliciting a high-dimensional probability distribution from an expert via noisy judgments is notoriously challenging, yet useful for many applications, such as prior elicitation and reward modeling. We introduce a method for eliciting the expert's belief density as a normalizing flow based solely on preferential questions such as comparing or ranking alternatives. This allows eliciting in principle arbitrarily flexible densities, but flow estimation is susceptible to the challenge of collapsing or diverging probability mass that makes it difficult in practice. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel functional prior for the flow, motivated by a decision-theoretic argument, and show empirically that the belief density can be inferred as the function-space maximum a posteriori estimate. We demonstrate our method by eliciting multivariate belief densities of simulated experts, including the prior belief of a general-purpose large language model over a real-world dataset.</description>

Abstract: Causal machine learning (ML) offers flexible, data-driven methods for predicting treatment outcomes including efficacy and toxicity, thereby supporting the assessment and safety of drugs. A key benefit of causal ML is that it allows for estimating individualized treatment effects, so that clinical decision-making can be personalized to individual patient profiles. Causal ML can be used in combination with both clinical trial data and real-world data, such as clinical registries and electronic health records, but caution is needed to avoid biased or incorrect predictions. In this Perspective, we discuss the benefits of causal ML (relative to traditional statistical or ML approaches) and outline the key components and steps. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of causal ML and effective translation into the clinic.</description>

      <title>Integrating Expert Judgment and Algorithmic Decision Making: An Indistinguishability Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for human-AI collaboration in prediction and decision tasks. Our approach leverages human judgment to distinguish inputs which are algorithmically indistinguishable, or "look the same" to any feasible predictive algorithm. We argue that this framing clarifies the problem of human-AI collaboration in prediction and decision tasks, as experts often form judgments by drawing on information which is not encoded in an algorithm's training data. Algorithmic indistinguishability yields a natural test for assessing whether experts incorporate this kind of "side information", and further provides a simple but principled method for selectively incorporating human feedback into algorithmic predictions. We show that this method provably improves the performance of any feasible algorithmic predictor and precisely quantify this improvement. We demonstrate the utility of our framework in a case study of emergency room triage decisions, where we find that although algorithmic risk scores are highly competitive with physicians, there is strong evidence that physician judgments provide signal which could not be replicated by any predictive algorithm. This insight yields a range of natural decision rules which leverage the complementary strengths of human experts and predictive algorithms.</description>

      <title>Batched Energy-Entropy acquisition for Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is an attractive machine learning framework for performing sample-efficient global optimization of black-box functions. The optimization process is guided by an acquisition function that selects points to acquire in each round of BO. In batched BO, when multiple points are acquired in parallel, commonly used acquisition functions are often high-dimensional and intractable, leading to the use of sampling-based alternatives. We propose a statistical physics inspired acquisition function for BO with Gaussian processes that can natively handle batches. Batched Energy-Entropy acquisition for BO (BEEBO) enables tight control of the explore-exploit trade-off of the optimization process and generalizes to heteroskedastic black-box problems. We demonstrate the applicability of BEEBO on a range of problems, showing competitive performance to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Unintentional Unalignment: Likelihood Displacement in Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08847v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants are increasingly used for aligning language models with human preferences. Although these methods are designed to teach a model to generate preferred responses more frequently relative to dispreferred responses, prior work has observed that the likelihood of preferred responses often decreases during training. The current work sheds light on the causes and implications of this counter-intuitive phenomenon, which we term likelihood displacement. We demonstrate that likelihood displacement can be catastrophic, shifting probability mass from preferred responses to responses with an opposite meaning. As a simple example, training a model to prefer $\texttt{No}$ over $\texttt{Never}$ can sharply increase the probability of $\texttt{Yes}$. Moreover, when aligning the model to refuse unsafe prompts, we show that such displacement can unintentionally lead to unalignment, by shifting probability mass from preferred refusal responses to harmful responses (e.g., reducing the refusal rate of Llama-3-8B-Instruct from 74.4% to 33.4%). We theoretically characterize that likelihood displacement is driven by preferences that induce similar embeddings, as measured by a centered hidden embedding similarity (CHES) score. Empirically, the CHES score enables identifying which training samples contribute most to likelihood displacement in a given dataset. Filtering out these samples effectively mitigated unintentional unalignment in our experiments. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of curating data with sufficiently distinct preferences, for which we believe the CHES score may prove valuable.</description>

      <title>Improved Sample Complexity for Global Convergence of Actor-Critic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the global convergence of the actor-critic algorithm with a significantly improved sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-3})$, advancing beyond the existing local convergence results. Previous works provide local convergence guarantees with a sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ for bounding the squared gradient of the return, which translates to a global sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ using the gradient domination lemma. In contrast to traditional methods that employ decreasing step sizes for both the actor and critic, we demonstrate that a constant step size for the critic is sufficient to ensure convergence in expectation. This key insight reveals that using a decreasing step size for the actor alone is sufficient to handle the noise for both the actor and critic. Our findings provide theoretical support for the practical success of many algorithms that rely on constant step sizes.</description>

      <title>Linear-cost unbiased posterior estimates for crossed effects and matrix factorization models via couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and analyze unbiased Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) schemes based on couplings of blocked Gibbs samplers (BGSs), whose total computational costs scale linearly with the number of parameters and data points. Our methodology is designed for and applicable to high-dimensional BGS with conditionally independent blocks, which are often encountered in Bayesian modeling. We provide bounds on the expected number of iterations needed for coalescence for Gaussian targets, which imply that practical two-step coupling strategies achieve coalescence times that match the relaxation times of the original BGS scheme up to a logarithmic factor. To illustrate the practical relevance of our methodology, we apply it to high-dimensional crossed random effect and probabilistic matrix factorization models, for which we develop a novel BGS scheme with improved convergence speed. Our methodology provides unbiased posterior estimates at linear cost (usually requiring only a few BGS iterations for problems with thousands of parameters), matching state-of-the-art procedures for both frequentist and Bayesian estimation of those models.</description>

      <title>Learning Representations of Instruments for Partial Identification of Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08976v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable estimation of treatment effects from observational data is important in many disciplines such as medicine. However, estimation is challenging when unconfoundedness as a standard assumption in the causal inference literature is violated. In this work, we leverage arbitrary (potentially high-dimensional) instruments to estimate bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE). Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We propose a novel approach for partial identification through a mapping of instruments to a discrete representation space so that we yield valid bounds on the CATE. This is crucial for reliable decision-making in real-world applications. (2) We derive a two-step procedure that learns tight bounds using a tailored neural partitioning of the latent instrument space. As a result, we avoid instability issues due to numerical approximations or adversarial training. Furthermore, our procedure aims to reduce the estimation variance in finite-sample settings to yield more reliable estimates. (3) We show theoretically that our procedure obtains valid bounds while reducing estimation variance. We further perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness across various settings. Overall, our procedure offers a novel path for practitioners to make use of potentially high-dimensional instruments (e.g., as in Mendelian randomization).</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Universal Value Function Approximators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been key advancements to building universal approximators for multi-goal collections of reinforcement learning value functions -- key elements in estimating long-term returns of states in a parameterized manner. We extend this to hierarchical reinforcement learning, using the options framework, by introducing hierarchical universal value function approximators (H-UVFAs). This allows us to leverage the added benefits of scaling, planning, and generalization expected in temporal abstraction settings. We develop supervised and reinforcement learning methods for learning embeddings of the states, goals, options, and actions in the two hierarchical value functions: $Q(s, g, o; \theta)$ and $Q(s, g, o, a; \theta)$. Finally we demonstrate generalization of the HUVFAs and show they outperform corresponding UVFAs.</description>

      <title>Learning Interpretable Characteristic Kernels via Decision Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.00029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A lesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a proximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced kernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and properties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced by decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF), which induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node proximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel, and prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both discrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it would outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate that KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across a diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing settings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides feature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions, unlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this work demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and more interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional wisdom of the trade-off between the two.</description>

      <title>Continuous Sweep for Binary Quantification Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm, focused on estimating the class prevalence in a dataset rather than labeling its individual observations. We introduce Continuous Sweep, a new parametric binary quantifier inspired by the well-performing Median Sweep, which is an ensemble method based on Adjusted Count estimators. We modified two aspects of Median Sweep: 1) using parametric class distributions instead of empirical distributions for the true and false positive rate; 2) using the mean instead of the median of a set of Adjusted Count estimates. These two modifications allow for a theoretical analysis of the bias and variance of Continuous Sweep. Furthermore, the expressions of bias and variance can be used to define optimal decision boundaries of the set of Adjusted count estimates to be used in the ensemble. We show in three simulation studies that Continuous Sweep outperforms the quantifiers in the group Classify, Count, and Correct, including Median Sweep, and is competitive with the two best quantifiers from the group Distribution Matchers. Also an empirical data set is analysed with these quantifiers showing similar performances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real applications of bandits have sparse non-zero rewards, leading to slow learning speed. Using problem-specific structures for careful distribution modeling is known as critical to estimation efficiency in statistics, yet is under-explored in bandits. We initiate the study of zero-inflated bandits, where the reward is modeled as a classic semi-parametric distribution called zero-inflated distribution. We design Upper Confidence Bound- and Thompson Sampling-type algorithms for this specific structure. We derive the regret bounds under both multi-armed bandits with general reward assumptions and contextual generalized linear bandit with sub-Gaussian rewards. In many settings, the regret rates of our algorithms are either minimax optimal or state-of-the-art. The superior empirical performance of our methods is demonstrated via numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Do we need rebalancing strategies? A theoretical and empirical study around SMOTE and its variants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a common rebalancing strategy for handling imbalanced tabular data sets. However, few works analyze SMOTE theoretically. In this paper, we prove that SMOTE  (with default parameter) tends to copy the original minority samples asymptotically. We also prove that SMOTE exhibits boundary artifacts, thus justifying existing SMOTE variants. Then we introduce two new SMOTE-related strategies, and compare them with state-of-the-art rebalancing procedures. Surprisingly, for most data sets, we observe that applying no rebalancing strategy is competitive in terms of predictive performances, with tuned random forests, logistic regression or LightGBM. For highly imbalanced data sets, our new methods, named CV-SMOTE and Multivariate Gaussian SMOTE, are competitive. Besides, our analysis sheds some lights on the behavior of common rebalancing strategies, when used in conjunction with random forests.</description>

      <title>skscope: Fast Sparsity-Constrained Optimization in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Applying iterative solvers on sparsity-constrained optimization (SCO) requires tedious mathematical deduction and careful programming/debugging that hinders these solvers' broad impact. In the paper, the library skscope is introduced to overcome such an obstacle. With skscope, users can solve the SCO by just programming the objective function. The convenience of skscope is demonstrated through two examples in the paper, where sparse linear regression and trend filtering are addressed with just four lines of code. More importantly, skscope's efficient implementation allows state-of-the-art solvers to quickly attain the sparse solution regardless of the high dimensionality of parameter space. Numerical experiments reveal the available solvers in skscope can achieve up to 80x speedup on the competing relaxation solutions obtained via the benchmarked convex solver. skscope is published on the Python Package Index (PyPI) and Conda, and its source code is available at: https://github.com/abess-team/skscope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning is a rapidly expanding field of research. Though the field has witnessed remarkable advances over the past few years, it remains statistically and computationally challenging to learn a single (point estimate) DAG from data, let alone provide uncertainty quantification. Our article addresses the difficult task of quantifying graph uncertainty by developing a Bayesian variational inference framework based on novel distributions that have support directly on the space of DAGs. The distributions, which we use to form our prior and variational posterior, are induced by a projection operation, whereby an arbitrary continuous distribution is projected onto the space of sparse weighted acyclic adjacency matrices (matrix representations of DAGs) with probability mass on exact zeros. Though the projection constitutes a combinatorial optimization problem, it is solvable at scale via recently developed techniques that reformulate acyclicity as a continuous constraint. We empirically demonstrate that our method, ProDAG, can deliver accurate inference and often outperforms existing state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>CAnDOIT: Causal Discovery with Observational and Interventional Data from Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of cause-and-effect is of the utmost importance in many branches of science, but also for many practical applications of intelligent systems. In particular, identifying causal relationships in situations that include hidden factors is a major challenge for methods that rely solely on observational data for building causal models. This paper proposes CAnDOIT, a causal discovery method to reconstruct causal models using both observational and interventional time-series data. The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real-world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well-known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis. A Python implementation of CAnDOIT has also been developed and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/lcastri/causalflow.</description>

      <title>Generalized Sparse Additive Model with Unknown Link Function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAM) have been successfully applied to high dimensional data analysis. However, most existing methods cannot simultaneously estimate the link function, the component functions and the variable interaction. To alleviate this problem, we propose a new sparse additive model, named generalized sparse additive model with unknown link function (GSAMUL), in which the component functions are estimated by B-spline basis and the unknown link function is estimated by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network. Furthermore, $\ell_{2,1}$-norm regularizer is used for variable selection. The proposed GSAMUL can realize both variable selection and hidden interaction. We integrate this estimation into a bilevel optimization problem, where the data is split into training set and validation set. In theory, we provide the guarantees about the convergence of the approximate procedure. In applications, experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real world data sets consistently validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning personalized decision policies from observational bandit feedback data across multiple heterogeneous data sources. In our approach, we introduce a novel regret analysis that establishes finite-sample upper bounds on distinguishing notions of global regret for all data sources on aggregate and of local regret for any given data source. We characterize these regret bounds by expressions of source heterogeneity and distribution shift. Moreover, we examine the practical considerations of this problem in the federated setting where a central server aims to train a policy on data distributed across the heterogeneous sources without collecting any of their raw data. We present a policy learning algorithm amenable to federation based on the aggregation of local policies trained with doubly robust offline policy evaluation strategies. Our analysis and supporting experimental results provide insights into tradeoffs in the participation of heterogeneous data sources in offline policy learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding Clean Generalization and Robust Overfitting in Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similar to surprising performance in the standard deep learning, deep nets trained by adversarial training also generalize well for $\textit{unseen clean data (natural data)}$. However, despite adversarial training can achieve low robust training error, there exists a significant $\textit{robust generalization gap}$. We call this phenomenon the $\textit{Clean Generalization and Robust Overfitting (CGRO)}$. In this work, we study the CGRO phenomenon in adversarial training from two views: $\textit{representation complexity}$ and $\textit{training dynamics}$. Specifically, we consider a binary classification setting with $N$ separated training data points. $\textit{First}$, we prove that, based on the assumption that we assume there is $\operatorname{poly}(D)$-size clean classifier (where $D$ is the data dimension), ReLU net with only $O(N D)$ extra parameters is able to leverages robust memorization to achieve the CGRO, while robust classifier still requires exponential representation complexity in worst case. $\textit{Next}$, we focus on a structured-data case to analyze training dynamics, where we train a two-layer convolutional network with $O(N D)$ width against adversarial perturbation. We then show that a three-stage phase transition occurs during learning process and the network provably converges to robust memorization regime, which thereby results in the CGRO. $\textit{Besides}$, we also empirically verify our theoretical analysis by experiments in real-image recognition datasets.</description>

      <title>Certified Multi-Fidelity Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-fidelity zeroth-order optimization, where one can evaluate a function $f$ at various approximation levels (of varying costs), and the goal is to optimize $f$ with the cheapest evaluations possible. In this paper, we study certified algorithms, which are additionally required to output a data-driven upper bound on the optimization error. We first formalize the problem in terms of a min-max game between an algorithm and an evaluation environment. We then propose a certified variant of the MFDOO algorithm and derive a bound on its cost complexity for any Lipschitz function $f$. We also prove an $f$-dependent lower bound showing that this algorithm has a near-optimal cost complexity. As a direct example, we close the paper by addressing the special case of noisy (stochastic) evaluations, which corresponds to $\eps$-best arm identification in Lipschitz bandits with continuously many arms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Logistic-softmax Likelihood in Bayesian Meta-Learning for Few-Shot Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-learning has demonstrated promising results in few-shot classification (FSC) by learning to solve new problems using prior knowledge. Bayesian methods are effective at characterizing uncertainty in FSC, which is crucial in high-risk fields. In this context, the logistic-softmax likelihood is often employed as an alternative to the softmax likelihood in multi-class Gaussian process classification due to its conditional conjugacy property. However, the theoretical property of logistic-softmax is not clear and previous research indicated that the inherent uncertainty of logistic-softmax leads to suboptimal performance. To mitigate these issues, we revisit and redesign the logistic-softmax likelihood, which enables control of the \textit{a priori} confidence level through a temperature parameter. Furthermore, we theoretically and empirically show that softmax can be viewed as a special case of logistic-softmax and logistic-softmax induces a larger family of data distribution than softmax. Utilizing modified logistic-softmax, we integrate the data augmentation technique into the deep kernel based Gaussian process meta-learning framework, and derive an analytical mean-field approximation for task-specific updates. Our approach yields well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and achieves comparable or superior results on standard benchmark datasets.

      <title>Consistency for constrained maximum likelihood estimation and clustering based on mixtures of elliptically-symmetric distributions under general data generating processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06108v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The consistency of the maximum likelihood estimator for mixtures of elliptically-symmetric distributions for estimating its population version is shown, where the underlying distribution $P$ is nonparametric and does not necessarily belong to the class of mixtures on which the estimator is based. In a situation where $P$ is a mixture of well enough separated but nonparametric distributions it is shown that the components of the population version of the estimator correspond to the well separated components of $P$. This provides some theoretical justification for the use of such estimators for cluster analysis in case that $P$ has well separated subpopulations even if these subpopulations differ from what the mixture model assumes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02027v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control, which has the goal of driving the behavior of noisy systems, is broadly applicable in science, engineering and artificial intelligence. Our work introduces Stochastic Optimal Control Matching (SOCM), a novel Iterative Diffusion Optimization (IDO) technique for stochastic optimal control that stems from the same philosophy as the conditional score matching loss for diffusion models. That is, the control is learned via a least squares problem by trying to fit a matching vector field. The training loss, which is closely connected to the cross-entropy loss, is optimized with respect to both the control function and a family of reparameterization matrices which appear in the matching vector field. The optimization with respect to the reparameterization matrices aims at minimizing the variance of the matching vector field. Experimentally, our algorithm achieves lower error than all the existing IDO techniques for stochastic optimal control for three out of four control problems, in some cases by an order of magnitude. The key idea underlying SOCM is the path-wise reparameterization trick, a novel technique that may be of independent interest. Code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/SOC-matching</description>

      <title>Online Performance Estimation with Unlabeled Data: A Bayesian Application of the Hui-Walter Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the industrial practice of machine learning and statistical modeling, practitioners often work under the assumption of accessible, static, labeled data for evaluation and training. However, this assumption often deviates from reality, where data may be private, encrypted, difficult-to-measure, or unlabeled. In this paper, we bridge this gap by adapting the Hui-Walter paradigm, a method traditionally applied in epidemiology and medicine, to the field of machine learning. This approach enables us to estimate key performance metrics such as false positive rate, false negative rate, and priors in scenarios where no ground truth is available. We further extend this paradigm for handling online data, opening up new possibilities for dynamic data environments. Our methodology involves partitioning data into latent classes to simulate multiple data populations (if natural populations are unavailable) and independently training models to replicate multiple tests. By cross-tabulating binary outcomes across multiple categorizers and multiple populations, we are able to estimate unknown parameters through Gibbs sampling, eliminating the need for ground-truth or labeled data. This paper showcases the potential of our methodology to transform machine learning practices by allowing for accurate model assessment under dynamic and uncertain data conditions.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Quantization and Sparsification for Multiclass Linear Classification with Strong Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the use of linear regression for multiclass classification in the over-parametrized regime where some of the training data is mislabeled. In such scenarios it is necessary to add an explicit regularization term, $\lambda f(w)$, for some convex function $f(\cdot)$, to avoid overfitting the mislabeled data. In our analysis, we assume that the data is sampled from a Gaussian Mixture Model with equal class sizes, and that a proportion $c$ of the training labels is corrupted for each class. Under these assumptions, we prove that the best classification performance is achieved when $f(\cdot) = \|\cdot\|^2_2$ and $\lambda \to \infty$. We then proceed to analyze the classification errors for $f(\cdot) = \|\cdot\|_1$ and $f(\cdot) = \|\cdot\|_\infty$ in the large $\lambda$ regime and notice that it is often possible to find sparse and one-bit solutions, respectively, that perform almost as well as the one corresponding to $f(\cdot) = \|\cdot\|_2^2$.</description>

      <title>Negative Preference Optimization: From Catastrophic Collapse to Effective Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often memorize sensitive, private, or copyrighted data during pre-training. LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model's utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse -- a drastic degradation of the model's utilities.
  In this paper, we propose Negative Preference Optimization (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired method that could efficiently and effectively unlearn a target dataset. We theoretically show that the progression toward catastrophic collapse by minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than GA. Through experiments on synthetic data and the benchmark TOFU dataset, we demonstrate that NPO-based methods achieve a better balance between unlearning the undesirable data and maintaining the model's utilities. We also observe that NPO-based methods generate more sensible outputs than GA-based methods, whose outputs are often gibberish. Remarkably, on TOFU, NPO-based methods are the first to achieve reasonable unlearning results in forgetting 50% (or more) of the training data, whereas existing methods already struggle with forgetting 10% of training data.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error for Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13503v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calibration allows predictions to be reliably interpreted as probabilities by decision makers. We propose a decision-theoretic calibration error, the Calibration Decision Loss (CDL), defined as the maximum improvement in decision payoff obtained by calibrating the predictions, where the maximum is over all payoff-bounded decision tasks. Vanishing CDL guarantees the payoff loss from miscalibration vanishes simultaneously for all downstream decision tasks. We show separations between CDL and existing calibration error metrics, including the most well-studied metric Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Our main technical contribution is a new efficient algorithm for online calibration that achieves near-optimal $O(\frac{\log T}{\sqrt{T}})$ expected CDL, bypassing the $\Omega(T^{-0.472})$ lower bound for ECE by Qiao and Valiant (2021).</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Adaptive Gradient Methods under Refined Smoothness and Noise Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods, such as AdaGrad, are among the most successful optimization algorithms for neural network training. While these methods are known to achieve better dimensional dependence than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under favorable geometry for stochastic convex optimization, the theoretical justification for their success in stochastic non-convex optimization remains elusive. In fact, under standard assumptions of Lipschitz gradients and bounded noise variance, it is known that SGD is worst-case optimal (up to absolute constants) in terms of finding a near-stationary point with respect to the $\ell_2$-norm, making further improvements impossible. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce refined assumptions on the smoothness structure of the objective and the gradient noise variance, which better suit the coordinate-wise nature of adaptive gradient methods. Moreover, we adopt the $\ell_1$-norm of the gradient as the stationarity measure, as opposed to the standard $\ell_2$-norm, to align with the coordinate-wise analysis and obtain tighter convergence guarantees for AdaGrad. Under these new assumptions and the $\ell_1$-norm stationarity measure, we establish an upper bound on the convergence rate of AdaGrad and a corresponding lower bound for SGD. In particular, for certain configurations of problem parameters, we show that the iteration complexity of AdaGrad outperforms SGD by a factor of $d$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to demonstrate a provable gain of adaptive gradient methods over SGD in a non-convex setting. We also present supporting lower bounds, including one specific to AdaGrad and one applicable to general deterministic first-order methods, showing that our upper bound for AdaGrad is tight and unimprovable up to a logarithmic factor under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Auditing Differential Privacy Guarantees Using Density Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for accurately auditing the differential privacy (DP) guarantees of DP mechanisms. In particular, our solution is applicable to auditing DP guarantees of machine learning (ML) models. Previous auditing methods tightly capture the privacy guarantees of DP-SGD trained models in the white-box setting where the auditor has access to all intermediate models; however, the success of these methods depends on a priori information about the parametric form of the noise and the subsampling ratio used for sampling the gradients. We present a method that does not require such information and is agnostic to the randomization used for the underlying mechanism. Similarly to several previous DP auditing methods, we assume that the auditor has access to a set of independent observations from two one-dimensional distributions corresponding to outputs from two neighbouring datasets. Furthermore, our solution is based on a simple histogram-based density estimation technique to find lower bounds for the statistical distance between these distributions when measured using the hockey-stick divergence. We show that our approach also naturally generalizes the previously considered class of threshold membership inference auditing methods. We improve upon accurate auditing methods such as the $f$-DP auditing. Moreover, we address an open problem on how to accurately audit the subsampled Gaussian mechanism without any knowledge of the parameters of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Standardizing Structural Causal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets generated by structural causal models (SCMs) are commonly used for benchmarking causal structure learning algorithms. However, the variances and pairwise correlations in SCM data tend to increase along the causal ordering. Several popular algorithms exploit these artifacts, possibly leading to conclusions that do not generalize to real-world settings. Existing metrics like $\operatorname{Var}$-sortability and $\operatorname{R^2}$-sortability quantify these patterns, but they do not provide tools to remedy them. To address this, we propose internally-standardized structural causal models (iSCMs), a modification of SCMs that introduces a standardization operation at each variable during the generative process. By construction, iSCMs are not $\operatorname{Var}$-sortable, and as we show experimentally, not $\operatorname{R^2}$-sortable either for commonly-used graph families. Moreover, contrary to the post-hoc standardization of data generated by standard SCMs, we prove that linear iSCMs are less identifiable from prior knowledge on the weights and do not collapse to deterministic relationships in large systems, which may make iSCMs a useful model in causal inference beyond the benchmarking problem studied here.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Measures on Lattices for High-Order Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional models based solely on pairwise associations often fail to capture the complex statistical structure of multivariate data. Existing approaches for identifying information shared among groups of $d&gt;3$ variables are frequently computationally intractable, asymmetric with respect to a target variable, or unable to account for all factorisations of the joint probability distribution. We present a systematic framework that derives higher-order information-theoretic measures using lattice and operator function pairs, whereby the lattice representing the algebraic relationships among variables, with operator functions that compute the measures over the lattice. We show that many commonly used measures can be derived within this framework, however they are often restricted to sublattices of the partition lattice, which prevents them from capturing all interactions when $d&gt;3$. We also demonstrate that KL divergence, when used as an operator function, leads to unwanted cancellation of interactions for $d&gt;3$. To fully characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg Information, using generalisations of KL divergence as an operator function, and defined over the full partition lattice. We validate Streitberg Information numerically on synthetic data, and illustrate its application in analysing complex interactions among stocks, decoding neural signals, and performing feature selection in machine learning.</description>

      <title>Oja's plasticity rule overcomes several challenges of training neural networks under biological constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a large literature on the similarities and differences between biological neural circuits and deep artificial neural networks (DNNs). However, modern training of DNNs relies on several engineering tricks such as data batching, normalization, adaptive optimizers, and precise weight initialization. Despite their critical role in training DNNs, these engineering tricks are often overlooked when drawing parallels between biological and artificial networks, potentially due to a lack of evidence for their direct biological implementation. In this study, we show that Oja's plasticity rule partly overcomes the need for some engineering tricks. Specifically, under difficult, but biologically realistic learning scenarios such as online learning, deep architectures, and sub-optimal weight initialization, Oja's rule can substantially improve the performance of pure backpropagation. Our results demonstrate that simple synaptic plasticity rules can overcome challenges to learning that are typically overcome using less biologically plausible approaches when training DNNs.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics of Bagging Regularized M-estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize the squared prediction risk of ensemble estimators obtained through subagging (subsample bootstrap aggregating) regularized M-estimators and construct a consistent estimator for the risk. Specifically, we consider a heterogeneous collection of $M \ge 1$ regularized M-estimators, each trained with (possibly different) subsample sizes, convex differentiable losses, and convex regularizers. We operate under the proportional asymptotics regime, where the sample size $n$, feature size $p$, and subsample sizes $k_m$ for $m \in [M]$ all diverge with fixed limiting ratios $n/p$ and $k_m/n$. Key to our analysis is a new result on the joint asymptotic behavior of correlations between the estimator and residual errors on overlapping subsamples, governed through a (provably) contractible nonlinear system of equations. Of independent interest, we also establish convergence of trace functionals related to degrees of freedom in the non-ensemble setting (with $M = 1$) along the way, extending previously known cases for square loss and ridge, lasso regularizers.
  When specialized to homogeneous ensembles trained with a common loss, regularizer, and subsample size, the risk characterization sheds some light on the implicit regularization effect due to the ensemble and subsample sizes $(M,k)$. For any ensemble size $M$, optimally tuning subsample size yields sample-wise monotonic risk. For the full-ensemble estimator (when $M \to \infty$), the optimal subsample size $k^\star$ tends to be in the overparameterized regime $(k^\star \le \min\{n,p\})$, when explicit regularization is vanishing. Finally, joint optimization of subsample size, ensemble size, and regularization can significantly outperform regularizer optimization alone on the full data (without any subagging).</description>

Abstract: Implicit networks are a class of neural networks whose outputs are defined by the fixed point of a parameterized operator. They have enjoyed success in many applications including natural language processing, image processing, and numerous other applications. While they have found abundant empirical success, theoretical work on its generalization is still under-explored. In this work, we consider a large family of implicit networks defined parameterized contractive fixed point operators. We show a generalization bound for this class based on a covering number argument for the Rademacher complexity of these architectures.</description>
