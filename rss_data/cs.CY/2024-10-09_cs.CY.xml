      <title>Towards an Operational Responsible AI Framework for Learning Analytics in Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universities are increasingly adopting data-driven strategies to enhance student success, with AI applications like Learning Analytics (LA) and Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA) playing a key role in identifying at-risk students, personalising learning, supporting teachers, and guiding educational decision-making. However, concerns are rising about potential harms these systems may pose, such as algorithmic biases leading to unequal support for minority students. While many have explored the need for Responsible AI in LA, existing works often lack practical guidance for how institutions can operationalise these principles. In this paper, we propose a novel Responsible AI framework tailored specifically to LA in Higher Education (HE). We started by mapping 11 established Responsible AI frameworks, including those by leading tech companies, to the context of LA in HE. This led to the identification of seven key principles such as transparency, fairness, and accountability. We then conducted a systematic review of the literature to understand how these principles have been applied in practice. Drawing from these findings, we present a novel framework that offers practical guidance to HE institutions and is designed to evolve with community input, ensuring its relevance as LA systems continue to develop.</description>

      <title>Digital Labor and the Inconspicuous Production of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital platforms capitalize on users' labor, often disguising essential contributions as casual activities or consumption, regardless of users' recognition of their efforts. Data annotation, content creation, and engagement with advertising are all aspects of this hidden productivity. Despite playing a crucial role in driving AI development, such tasks remain largely unrecognized and undercompensated. This chapter exposes the systemic devaluation of these activities in the digital economy, by drawing on historical theories about unrecognized labor, from housework to audience labor. This approach advocates for a broader understanding of digital labor by introducing the concept of ''inconspicuous production.'' It moves beyond the traditional notion of ''invisible work'' to highlight the hidden elements inherent in all job types, especially in light of growing automation and platform-based employment.</description>

      <title>Can metacognition predict your success in solving problems? An exploratory case study in programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metacognition has been recognized as an essential skill for academic success and for performance in solving problems. During learning or problem-solving, metacognitive skills facilitate a range of cognitive and affective processes, leading collectively to improved performance. This study explores the predictive potential of metacognition in the second introductory programming course. A two-dimensional model has been proposed, consisting of metacognitive awareness and metacognitive behavior. To evaluate the predictive capacity of metacognition empirically, an exploratory case study with 194 participants from two institutions was conducted in the second introductory programming course. A latent approach was employed to examine the associations between metacognition and performance in object-oriented programming. Our findings indicate that both metacognitive dimensions have a positive effect on programming. Likewise, the results of the structural equation modeling show that 27% of variance in programming performance is explained by metacognitive behavior. Following the results, metacognition has the potential to be considered as one of the important predictors of performance in introductory programming.</description>

      <title>Score Design for Multi-Criteria Incentivization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for designing scores to summarize performance metrics. Our design has two multi-criteria objectives: (1) improving on scores should improve all performance metrics, and (2) achieving pareto-optimal scores should achieve pareto-optimal metrics. We formulate our design to minimize the dimensionality of scores while satisfying the objectives. We give algorithms to design scores, which are provably minimal under mild assumptions on the structure of performance metrics. This framework draws motivation from real-world practices in hospital rating systems, where misaligned scores and performance metrics lead to unintended consequences.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Theory of Meaning. Application to Financial Markets. EUR/USD case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the link between information, investors' expectations and market price movement. EUR/USD market is examined from communication-theoretical perspective on the dynamics of information and meaning. We build upon the quantitative theory of meaning as a complement to the quantitative theory of information. Different groups of investors entertain different criteria to process information, so that the same information can be supplied with different meanings. Meanings shape investors' expectations which are revealed in market asset price movement. This dynamics can be captured by non-linear evolutionary equation. We use a computationally efficient technique of logistic Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT) to analyze EUR/USD market. The results reveal the latent EUR/USD trend structure which coincides with the model predicted time series indicating that proposed model can adequately describe some patterns of investors' behavior. Proposed methodology can be used to better understand and forecast future market assets' price movement.</description>

      <title>AI, Climate, and Regulation: From Data Centers to the AI Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We live in a world that is experiencing an unprecedented boom of AI applications that increasingly penetrate and enhance all sectors of private and public life, from education, media, medicine, and mobility to the industrial and professional workspace, and -- potentially particularly consequentially -- robotics. As this world is simultaneously grappling with climate change, the climate and environmental implications of the development and use of AI have become an important subject of public and academic debate. In this paper, we aim to provide guidance on the climate-related regulation for data centers and AI specifically, and discuss how to operationalize these requirements. We also highlight challenges and room for improvement, and make a number of policy proposals to this end. In particular, we propose a specific interpretation of the AI Act to bring reporting on the previously unadressed energy consumption from AI inferences back into the scope. We also find that the AI Act fails to address indirect greenhouse gas emissions from AI applications. Furthermore, for the purpose of energy consumption reporting, we compare levels of measurement within data centers and recommend measurement at the cumulative server level. We also argue for an interpretation of the AI Act that includes environmental concerns in the mandatory risk assessment (sustainability risk assessment, SIA), and provide guidance on its operationalization. The EU data center regulation proves to be a good first step but requires further development by including binding renewable energy and efficiency targets for data centers. Overall, we make twelve concrete policy proposals, in four main areas: Energy and Environmental Reporting Obligations; Legal and Regulatory Clarifications; Transparency and Accountability Mechanisms; and Future Far-Reaching Measures beyond Transparency.</description>

      <title>Students' Perceptions and Use of Generative AI Tools for Programming Across Different Computing Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigation of students' perceptions and opinions on the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in education is a topic gaining much interest. Studies addressing this are typically conducted with large heterogeneous groups, at one moment in time. However, how students perceive and use GenAI tools can potentially depend on many factors, including their background knowledge, familiarity with the tools, and the learning goals and policies of the courses they are taking.
  In this study we explore how students following computing courses use GenAI for programming-related tasks across different programs and courses: Bachelor and Master, in courses in which learning programming is the learning goal, courses that require programming as a means to achieve another goal, and in courses in which programming is optional, but can be useful. We are also interested in changes over time, since GenAI capabilities are changing at a fast pace, and users are adopting GenAI increasingly.
  We conducted three consecutive surveys (fall `23, winter `23, and spring `24) among students of all computing programs of a large European research university. We asked questions on the use in education, ethics, and job prospects, and we included specific questions on the (dis)allowed use of GenAI tools in the courses they were taking at the time.
  We received 264 responses, which we quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, to find out how students have employed GenAI tools across 59 different computing courses, and whether the opinion of an average student about these tools evolves over time. Our study contributes to the emerging discussion of how to differentiate GenAI use across different courses, and how to align its use with the learning goals of a computing course.</description>

      <title>To Be or Not to Be (in the EU): Measurement of Discrepancies Presented in Cookie Paywalls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cookie paywalls allow visitors to access the content of a website only after making a choice between paying a fee (paying option) or accepting tracking (cookie option). The practice has been studied in previous research in regard to its prevalence and legal standing, but the effects of the clients' device and geographic location remain unexplored. To address these questions, this study explores the effects of three factors: 1) the clients' browser, 2) the device type (desktop or mobile), and 3) the geographic location on the presence and behavior of cookie paywalls and the handling of users' data.
  Using an automatic crawler on our dataset composed of 804 websites that present a cookie paywall, we observed that the presence of a cookie paywall was most affected by the geographic location of the user. We further showed that both the behavior of a cookie paywall and the processing of user data are impacted by all three factors, but no patterns of significance could be found. Finally, an additional type of paywall was discovered to be used on approximately 11% of the studied websites, coined the "double paywall", which consists of a cookie paywall complemented by another paywall once tracking is accepted.</description>

      <title>How Unique is Whose Web Browser? The role of demographics in browser fingerprinting among US users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Browser fingerprinting can be used to identify and track users across the Web, even without cookies, by collecting attributes from users' devices to create unique "fingerprints". This technique and resulting privacy risks have been studied for over a decade. Yet further research is limited because prior studies used data not publicly available. Additionally, data in prior studies lacked user demographics. Here we provide a first-of-its-kind dataset to enable further research. It includes browser attributes with users' demographics and survey responses, collected with informed consent from 8,400 US study participants. We use this dataset to demonstrate how fingerprinting risks differ across demographic groups. For example, we find lower income users are more at risk, and find that as users' age increases, they are both more likely to be concerned about fingerprinting and at real risk of fingerprinting. Furthermore, we demonstrate an overlooked risk: user demographics, such as gender, age, income level and race, can be inferred from browser attributes commonly used for fingerprinting, and we identify which browser attributes most contribute to this risk. Our data collection process also conducted an experiment to study what impacts users' likelihood to share browser data for open research, in order to inform future data collection efforts, with responses from 12,461 total participants. Female participants were significantly less likely to share their browser data, as were participants who were shown the browser data we asked to collect. Overall, we show the important role of user demographics in the ongoing work that intends to assess fingerprinting risks and improve user privacy, with findings to inform future privacy enhancing browser developments. The dataset and data collection tool we provide can be used to further study research questions not addressed in this work.</description>

      <title>System 2 thinking in OpenAI's o1-preview model: Near-perfect performance on a mathematics exam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes underlying human cognition are often divided into two systems: System 1, which involves fast, intuitive thinking, and System 2, which involves slow, deliberate reasoning. Previously, large language models were criticized for lacking the deeper, more analytical capabilities of System 2. In September 2024, OpenAI introduced the O1 model series, specifically designed to handle System 2-like reasoning. While OpenAI's benchmarks are promising, independent validation is still needed. In this study, we tested the O1-preview model twice on the Dutch 'Mathematics B' final exam. It scored a near-perfect 76 and 73 out of 76 points. For context, only 24 out of 16,414 students in the Netherlands achieved a perfect score. By comparison, the GPT-4o model scored 66 and 61 out of 76, well above the Dutch average of 40.63 points. The O1-preview model completed the exam in around 10 minutes, while GPT-4o took 3 minutes, and neither model had access to the exam figures. Although O1-preview had the ability to achieve a perfect score, its performance showed some variability, as it made occasional mistakes with repeated prompting. This suggests that the self-consistency method, where the consensus output is selected, could improve accuracy. We conclude that while OpenAI's new model series holds great potential, certain risks must be considered.</description>

      <title>Transforming disaster risk reduction with AI and big data: Legal and interdisciplinary perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing complex disaster risks requires interdisciplinary efforts. Breaking down silos between law, social sciences, and natural sciences is critical for all processes of disaster risk reduction. This enables adaptive systems for the rapid evolution of AI technology, which has significantly impacted the intersection of law and natural environments. Exploring how AI influences legal frameworks and environmental management, while also examining how legal and environmental considerations can confine AI within the socioeconomic domain, is essential.
  From a co-production review perspective, drawing on insights from lawyers, social scientists, and environmental scientists, principles for responsible data mining are proposed based on safety, transparency, fairness, accountability, and contestability. This discussion offers a blueprint for interdisciplinary collaboration to create adaptive law systems based on AI integration of knowledge from environmental and social sciences. Discrepancies in the use of language between environmental scientists and decision-makers in terms of usefulness and accuracy hamper how AI can be used based on the principles of legal considerations for a safe, trustworthy, and contestable disaster management framework.
  When social networks are useful for mitigating disaster risks based on AI, the legal implications related to privacy and liability of the outcomes of disaster management must be considered. Fair and accountable principles emphasise environmental considerations and foster socioeconomic discussions related to public engagement. AI also has an important role to play in education, bringing together the next generations of law, social sciences, and natural sciences to work on interdisciplinary solutions in harmony.</description>

      <title>2022 Flood Impact in Pakistan: Remote Sensing Assessment of Agricultural and Urban Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pakistan was hit by the world's deadliest flood in June 2022, causing agriculture and infrastructure damage across the country. Remote sensing technology offers a cost-effective and efficient method for flood impact assessment. This study is aimed to assess the impact of flooding on crops and built-up areas. Landsat 9 imagery, European Space Agency-Land Use/Land Cover (ESA-LULC) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data are used to identify and quantify the extent of flood-affected areas, crop damage, and built-up area destruction. The findings indicate that Sindh, a province in Pakistan, suffered the most. This impact destroyed most Kharif season crops, typically cultivated from March to November. Using the SMAP satellite data, it is assessed that the high amount of soil moisture after flood also caused a significant delay in the cultivation of Rabi crops. The findings of this study provide valuable information for decision-makers and stakeholders involved in flood risk management and disaster response.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of waterway lock service quality in Yangtze Delta: from the perspectives of customer and supplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, the waterway locks in the Yangtze Delta, China, have become major traffic bottlenecks. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the crew's perspectives and primary concerns regarding lock services during vessel lockage, and to enhance customer satisfaction and improve vessel lockage efficiency, it is necessary to assess the waterway lock service quality (WLSQ). This paper presents an evaluation system for WLSQ from various stakeholders' viewpoints. Firstly, by employing questionnaire surveys and the structural equation model method, in conjunction with factor analysis, the WLSQ and its influencing factors in the Yangtze River Delta region are analyzed from a customer perspective. Secondly, the Analytic Hierarchy Process method is utilized, along with a dedicated questionnaire for service suppliers, to examine their concerns regarding the performance of vessel lock services. The findings indicate that there exists a cognitive bias towards factors influencing the WLSQ. Crew members express the greatest concern over vessel lockage delays, whereas vessel lockage safety is the primary concern for management department administrators. Furthermore, enhancing the supporting facilities of waterway locks can significantly increase crew members' satisfaction during vessel lockage. Improving staff skills, and safety conditions can also greatly enhance customers' tolerance for lockage delays. The results of this study will provide valuable insights for the lock management department, operators, and the government in formulating relevant policies to improve WLSQ and implementing ongoing service quality evaluations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Global South University Education with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, it has been observed that the center of gravity for the volume of higher education has shifted to the Global South. However, research indicates a widening disparity in the quality of higher education between the Global South and the Global North. Although investments in higher education within the Global South have increased, the rapid surge in student numbers has resulted in a decline in public expenditure per student. For instance, the student-to-teacher ratio in the Global South is significantly higher compared to that in the Global North, which poses a substantial barrier to the implementation of creative education. In response, Telkom University in Indonesia has embarked on an experiment to enhance the quality of learning and teaching by integrating large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT into five of its courses-Mathematics, English, Computing, Computer Systems, and Creative Media. This article elucidates the ongoing experimental plan and explores how the integration of LLMs could contribute to addressing the challenges currently faced by higher education in the Global South.</description>

      <title>Integrating problem structuring methods with formal design theory: collective water management policy design in Tunisia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Groundwater management, especially in regions like Tunisia, is challenging due to diverse stakeholder interests and the dry structure of climate, which is extremely challenging for the sustainability of water resources. This paper proposes an innovative approach to policy design by merging Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs) and the Policy-Knowledge, Concepts, Proposals (P-KCP) methodology. Utilizing cognitive maps and value trees, the study aims to generate new collective groundwater management practices. Bridging decision theory and design theory, the study addresses the gap in new alternative generation and highlights the P-KCP's role in innovative policy design. Integrating PSMs and C-K theory, the framework expands policy alternatives and advocates for participatory approaches. It emphasizes adaptability across contexts, provides replicable process descriptions, and encourages the creation of unconventional policy solutions. Ultimately, this comprehensive framework offers a practical guide for policy innovation and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Post-hoc Study of Climate Microtargeting on Social Media Ads with LLMs: Thematic Insights and Fairness Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change communication on social media increasingly employs microtargeting strategies to effectively reach and influence specific demographic groups. This study presents a post-hoc analysis of microtargeting practices within climate campaigns by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to examine Facebook advertisements. Our analysis focuses on two key aspects: demographic targeting and fairness. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict the intended demographic targets, such as gender and age group, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.55%. Furthermore, we instruct the LLMs to generate explanations for their classifications, providing transparent reasoning behind each decision. These explanations reveal the specific thematic elements used to engage different demographic segments, highlighting distinct strategies tailored to various audiences. Our findings show that young adults are primarily targeted through messages emphasizing activism and environmental consciousness, while women are engaged through themes related to caregiving roles and social advocacy. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting microtargeted messaging, we conduct a comprehensive fairness analysis to identify potential biases in model predictions. Our findings indicate that while LLMs perform well overall, certain biases exist, particularly in the classification of senior citizens and male audiences. By showcasing the efficacy of LLMs in dissecting and explaining targeted communication strategies and by highlighting fairness concerns, this study provides a valuable framework for future research aimed at enhancing transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in social media-driven climate campaigns.</description>

      <title>Evacuation patterns and socioeconomic stratification in the context of wildfires in Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is altering the frequency and intensity of wildfires, leading to increased evacuation events that disrupt human mobility and socioeconomic structures. These disruptions affect access to resources, employment, and housing, amplifying existing vulnerabilities within communities. Understanding the interplay between climate change, wildfires, evacuation patterns, and socioeconomic factors is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. To contribute to this challenge, we use high-definition mobile phone records to analyse evacuation patterns during the wildfires in Valpara\'iso, Chile, that took place between February 2-3, 2024. This data allows us to track the movements of individuals in the disaster area, providing insight into how people respond to large-scale evacuations in the context of severe wildfires. We apply a causal inference approach that combines regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences methodologies to observe evacuation behaviours during wildfires, with a focus on socioeconomic stratification. This approach allows us to isolate the impact of the wildfires on different socioeconomic groups by comparing the evacuation patterns of affected populations before and after the event, while accounting for underlying trends and discontinuities at the threshold of the disaster. We find that many people spent nights away from home, with those in the lowest socioeconomic segment stayed away the longest. In general, people reduced their travel distance during the evacuation, and the lowest socioeconomic group moved the least. Initially, movements became more random, as people sought refuge in a rush, but eventually gravitated towards areas with similar socioeconomic status. Our results show that socioeconomic differences play a role in evacuation dynamics, providing useful insights for response planning.</description>

      <title>The GDPR's Rules on Data Breaches: Analysing Their Rationales and Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires an organisation that suffers a data breach to notify the competent Data Protection Authority. The organisation must also inform the relevant individuals, when a data breach threatens their rights and freedoms. This paper focuses on the following question: given the goals of the GDPR's data breach notification obligation, and we assess the obligation in the light of those goals. We refer to insights from information security and economics, and present them in a reader-friendly way for lawyers. Our main conclusion is that the GDPR's data breach rules are likely to contribute to the goals. For instance, the data breach notification obligation can nudge organisations towards better security; such an obligation enables regulators to perform their duties; and such an obligation improves transparency and accountability. However, the paper also warns that we should not have unrealistic expectations of the possibilities for people to protect their interests after a data breach notice. Likewise, we should not have high expectations of people switching to other service providers after receiving a data breach notification. Lastly, the paper calls for Data Protection Authorities to publish more information about reported data breaches. Such information can help to analyse security threats.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{ModSCAN}$: Measuring Stereotypical Bias in Large Vision-Language Models from Vision and Language Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been rapidly developed and widely used in various fields, but the (potential) stereotypical bias in the model is largely unexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering measurement framework, $\texttt{ModSCAN}$, to $\underline{SCAN}$ the stereotypical bias within LVLMs from both vision and language $\underline{Mod}$alities. $\texttt{ModSCAN}$ examines stereotypical biases with respect to two typical stereotypical attributes (gender and race) across three kinds of scenarios: occupations, descriptors, and persona traits. Our findings suggest that 1) the currently popular LVLMs show significant stereotype biases, with CogVLM emerging as the most biased model; 2) these stereotypical biases may stem from the inherent biases in the training dataset and pre-trained models; 3) the utilization of specific prompt prefixes (from both vision and language modalities) performs well in reducing stereotypical biases. We believe our work can serve as the foundation for understanding and addressing stereotypical bias in LVLMs.</description>

      <title>I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent's anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents' personas, and particularly the guard's personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents' roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.</description>

      <title>Taking a turn for the better: Conversation redirection throughout the course of mental-health therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental-health therapy involves a complex conversation flow in which patients and therapists continuously negotiate what should be talked about next. For example, therapists might try to shift the conversation's direction to keep the therapeutic process on track and avoid stagnation, or patients might push the discussion towards issues they want to focus on.
  How do such patient and therapist redirections relate to the development and quality of their relationship? To answer this question, we introduce a probabilistic measure of the extent to which a certain utterance immediately redirects the flow of the conversation, accounting for both the intention and the actual realization of such a change. We apply this new measure to characterize the development of patient-therapist relationships over multiple sessions in a very large, widely-used online therapy platform. Our analysis reveals that (1) patient control of the conversation's direction generally increases relative to that of the therapist as their relationship progresses; and (2) patients who have less control in the first few sessions are significantly more likely to eventually express dissatisfaction with their therapist and terminate the relationship.</description>

      <title>GPT-4V Cannot Generate Radiology Reports Yet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GPT-4V's purported strong multimodal abilities raise interests in using it to automate radiology report writing, but there lacks thorough evaluations. In this work, we perform a systematic evaluation of GPT-4V in generating radiology reports on two chest X-ray report datasets: MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray. We attempt to directly generate reports using GPT-4V through different prompting strategies and find that it fails terribly in both lexical metrics and clinical efficacy metrics. To understand the low performance, we decompose the task into two steps: 1) the medical image reasoning step of predicting medical condition labels from images; and 2) the report synthesis step of generating reports from (groundtruth) conditions. We show that GPT-4V's performance in image reasoning is consistently low across different prompts. In fact, the distributions of model-predicted labels remain constant regardless of which groundtruth conditions are present on the image, suggesting that the model is not interpreting chest X-rays meaningfully. Even when given groundtruth conditions in report synthesis, its generated reports are less correct and less natural-sounding than a finetuned LLaMA-2. Altogether, our findings cast doubt on the viability of using GPT-4V in a radiology workflow.</description>

      <title>Asking an AI for salary negotiation advice is a matter of concern: Controlled experimental perturbation of ChatGPT for protected and non-protected group discrimination on a contextual task with no clear ground truth answers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted controlled experimental bias audits for four versions of ChatGPT, which we asked to recommend an opening offer in salary negotiations for a new hire. We submitted 98,800 prompts to each version, systematically varying the employee's gender, university, and major, and tested prompts in voice of each side of the negotiation: the employee versus employer. We find ChatGPT as a multi-model platform is not robust and consistent enough to be trusted for such a task. We observed statistically significant salary offers when varying gender for all four models, although with smaller gaps than for other attributes tested. The largest gaps were different model versions and between the employee- vs employer-voiced prompts. We also observed substantial gaps when varying university and major, but many of the biases were not consistent across model versions. We tested for fictional and fraudulent universities and found wildly inconsistent results across cases and model versions. We make broader contributions to the AI/ML fairness literature. Our scenario and our experimental design differ from mainstream AI/ML auditing efforts in key ways. Bias audits typically test discrimination for protected classes like gender, which we contrast with testing non-protected classes of university and major. Asking for negotiation advice includes how aggressive one ought to be in a negotiation relative to known empirical salary distributions and scales, which is a deeply contextual and personalized task that has no objective ground truth to validate. These results raise concerns for the specific model versions we tested and ChatGPT as a multi-model platform in continuous development. Our epistemology does not permit us to definitively certify these models as either generally biased or unbiased on the attributes we test, but our study raises matters of concern for stakeholders to further investigate.</description>

      <title>An Interdisciplinary Survey on Origin-destination Flows Modeling: Theory and Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10048v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Origin-destination (OD) flow modeling is an extensively researched subject across multiple disciplines, such as the investigation of travel demand in transportation and spatial interaction modeling in geography. However, researchers from different fields tend to employ their own unique research paradigms and lack interdisciplinary communication, preventing the cross-fertilization of knowledge and the development of novel solutions to challenges. This article presents a systematic interdisciplinary survey that comprehensively and holistically scrutinizes OD flows from utilizing fundamental theory to studying the mechanism of population mobility and solving practical problems with engineering techniques, such as computational models. Specifically, regional economics, urban geography, and sociophysics are adept at employing theoretical research methods to explore the underlying mechanisms of OD flows. They have developed three influential theoretical models: the gravity model, the intervening opportunities model, and the radiation model. These models specifically focus on examining the fundamental influences of distance, opportunities, and population on OD flows, respectively. In the meantime, fields such as transportation, urban planning, and computer science primarily focus on addressing four practical problems: OD prediction, OD construction, OD estimation, and OD forecasting. Advanced computational models, such as deep learning models, have gradually been introduced to address these problems more effectively. Finally, based on the existing research, this survey summarizes current challenges and outlines future directions for this topic. Through this survey, we aim to break down the barriers between disciplines in OD flow-related research, fostering interdisciplinary perspectives and modes of thinking.</description>

      <title>When "A Helpful Assistant" Is Not Really Helpful: Personas in System Prompts Do Not Improve Performances of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompting serves as the major way humans interact with Large Language Models (LLM). Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses ``You are a helpful assistant'' as part of its default system prompt. Despite current practices of adding personas to system prompts, it remains unclear how different personas affect a model's performance on objective tasks. In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of personas in system prompts. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 domains of expertise. Through extensive analysis of 4 popular families of LLMs and 2,410 factual questions, we demonstrate that adding personas in system prompts does not improve model performance across a range of questions compared to the control setting where no persona is added. Nevertheless, further analysis suggests that the gender, type, and domain of the persona can all influence the resulting prediction accuracies. We further experimented with a list of persona search strategies and found that, while aggregating results from the best persona for each question significantly improves prediction accuracy, automatically identifying the best persona is challenging, with predictions often performing no better than random selection. Overall, our findings suggest that while adding a persona may lead to performance gains in certain settings, the effect of each persona can be largely random.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) recently had its 'iPhone moment' and adoption has drastically accelerated. Quantum computing appears poised to follow suit over the next years. However, while there has been discourse about how to use AI responsibly, there is still little appreciation and awareness among executives, managers, and practitioners about the broader ethical questions and implications raised by the intersection of these emerging technologies. In this article, it is highlighted why quantum computing and AI ethics must be taken seriously by businesspersons and how these technologies affect strategic decisions; moreover, recommendations and action areas are formulated.</description>

Abstract: We conducted in-person ethnography in India and the US to investigate how young people (18-24) trusted online content, just as generative AI (genAI) became mainstream. We found that when online, how participants determined what content to trust was shaped by emotional states, which we term "information modes." Our participants reflexively shifted between modes to maintain "emotional equilibrium," and eschewed engaging literacy skills in the more passive modes in which they spent the most time. We found participants imported trust heuristics from established online contexts into emerging ones (i.e., genAI). This led them to use ill-fitting trust heuristics, and exposed them to the risk of trusting false and misleading information. While many had reservations about AI, prioritizing efficiency, they used genAI and habitual heuristics to quickly achieve goals at the expense of accuracy. We conclude that literacy interventions designed to match users' distinct information modes will be most effective.</description>

      <title>DiVERT: Distractor Generation with Variational Errors Represented as Text for Math Multiple-choice Questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-quality distractors are crucial to both the assessment and pedagogical value of multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where manually crafting ones that anticipate knowledge deficiencies or misconceptions among real students is difficult. Meanwhile, automated distractor generation, even with the help of large language models (LLMs), remains challenging for subjects like math. It is crucial to not only identify plausible distractors but also understand the error behind them. In this paper, we introduce DiVERT (Distractor Generation with Variational Errors Represented as Text), a novel variational approach that learns an interpretable representation of errors behind distractors in math MCQs. Through experiments on a real-world math MCQ dataset with 1,434 questions used by hundreds of thousands of students, we show that DiVERT, despite using a base open-source LLM with 7B parameters, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches using GPT-4o on downstream distractor generation. We also conduct a human evaluation with math educators and find that DiVERT leads to error labels that are of comparable quality to human-authored ones.</description>

      <title>Who is better at math, Jenny or Jingzhen? Uncovering Stereotypes in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to propagate and amplify harmful stereotypes, particularly those that disproportionately affect marginalised communities. To understand the effect of these stereotypes more comprehensively, we introduce GlobalBias, a dataset of 876k sentences incorporating 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups alongside descriptors typically used in bias literature, which enables us to study a broad set of stereotypes from around the world. We use GlobalBias to directly probe a suite of LMs via perplexity, which we use as a proxy to determine how certain stereotypes are represented in the model's internal representations. Following this, we generate character profiles based on given names and evaluate the prevalence of stereotypes in model outputs. We find that the demographic groups associated with various stereotypes remain consistent across model likelihoods and model outputs. Furthermore, larger models consistently display higher levels of stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly instructed not to.</description>

      <title>Improving Academic Skills Assessment with NLP and Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenges of assessing foundational academic skills by leveraging advancements in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional assessment methods often struggle to provide timely and comprehensive feedback on key cognitive and linguistic aspects, such as coherence, syntax, and analytical reasoning. Our approach integrates multiple state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DeBERTa, and T5, within an ensemble learning framework. These models are combined through stacking techniques using LightGBM and Ridge regression to enhance predictive accuracy. The methodology involves detailed data preprocessing, feature extraction, and pseudo-label learning to optimize model performance. By incorporating sophisticated NLP techniques and ensemble learning, this study significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of assessments, offering a robust solution that surpasses traditional methods and opens new avenues for educational technology research focused on enhancing core academic competencies.</description>

      <title>DCAST: Diverse Class-Aware Self-Training Mitigates Selection Bias for Fairer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness in machine learning seeks to mitigate model bias against individuals based on sensitive features such as sex or age, often caused by an uneven representation of the population in the training data due to selection bias. Notably, bias unascribed to sensitive features is challenging to identify and typically goes undiagnosed, despite its prominence in complex high-dimensional data from fields like computer vision and molecular biomedicine. Strategies to mitigate unidentified bias and evaluate mitigation methods are crucially needed, yet remain underexplored. We introduce: (i) Diverse Class-Aware Self-Training (DCAST), model-agnostic mitigation aware of class-specific bias, which promotes sample diversity to counter confirmation bias of conventional self-training while leveraging unlabeled samples for an improved representation of the underlying population; (ii) hierarchy bias, multivariate and class-aware bias induction without prior knowledge. Models learned with DCAST showed improved robustness to hierarchy and other biases across eleven datasets, against conventional self-training and six prominent domain adaptation techniques. Advantage was largest on multi-class classification, emphasizing DCAST as a promising strategy for fairer learning in different contexts.</description>

      <title>Collapsed Language Models Promote Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To mitigate societal biases implicitly encoded in recent successful pretrained language models, a diverse array of approaches have been proposed to encourage model fairness, focusing on prompting, data augmentation, regularized fine-tuning, and more. Despite the development, it is nontrivial to reach a principled understanding of fairness and an effective algorithm that can consistently debias language models. In this work, by rigorous evaluations of Neural Collapse -- a learning phenomenon happen in last-layer representations and classifiers in deep networks -- on fairness-related words, we find that debiased language models exhibit collapsed alignment between token representations and word embeddings. More importantly, this observation inspires us to design a principled fine-tuning method that can effectively improve fairness in a wide range of debiasing methods, while still preserving the performance of language models on standard natural language understanding tasks.

      <title>Evaluating the Generalization Ability of Spatiotemporal Model in Urban Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal neural networks have shown great promise in urban scenarios by effectively capturing temporal and spatial correlations. However, urban environments are constantly evolving, and current model evaluations are often limited to traffic scenarios and use data mainly collected only a few weeks after training period to evaluate model performance. The generalization ability of these models remains largely unexplored. To address this, we propose a Spatiotemporal Out-of-Distribution (ST-OOD) benchmark, which comprises six urban scenario: bike-sharing, 311 services, pedestrian counts, traffic speed, traffic flow, ride-hailing demand, and bike-sharing, each with in-distribution (same year) and out-of-distribution (next years) settings. We extensively evaluate state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models and find that their performance degrades significantly in out-of-distribution settings, with most models performing even worse than a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Our findings suggest that current leading methods tend to over-rely on parameters to overfit training data, which may lead to good performance on in-distribution data but often results in poor generalization. We also investigated whether dropout could mitigate the negative effects of overfitting. Our results showed that a slight dropout rate could significantly improve generalization performance on most datasets, with minimal impact on in-distribution performance. However, balancing in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance remains a challenging problem. We hope that the proposed benchmark will encourage further research on this critical issue.</description>
