      <title>Gravitational waves from b-EMRIs: Doppler shift and beaming, resonant excitation, helicity oscillations and self-lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from a stellar-mass binary orbiting a spinning supermassive black hole, a system referred to as a binary extreme mass ratio inspiral (b-EMRI). We use Dixon's formalism to describe the stellar-mass binary as a particle with internal structure, and keep terms up to quadrupole order to capture the generation of gravitational waves by the inner motion of the stellar-mass binary. The problem of emission and propagation of waves is treated from first principles using black hole perturbation theory. In the gravitational waveform at future null infinity, we identify for the first time Doppler shifts and beaming due to the motion of the center of mass, as well as helicity breaking gravitational lensing, and resonances with ringdown modes of the supermassive black hole. We establish that previously proposed phenomenological models inadequately capture these effects.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Lagrangian and Multisymplectic Hamiltonian Formalisms for the Description of Classical Fields Interacting with Point Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism that is known to manifestly preserve Lorentz covariance in the description of fields and has been suggested as a possible path for developing a covariant canonical quantization process. However, since this formalism allows for multiple definitions of Poisson brackets, its practical use in field theory has been very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the Lagrangian and the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalisms in the momentum representation for describing classical fields interacting with point particles by deriving the image in that representation of the de Donder-Weyl function for a general tensor representation of the Lorentz group. The calculation is performed explicitly for the complex scalar field, the electromagnetic field, and the classical Dirac field. The obtained results allow us to propose a Lorentz-covariant bilinear form as Poisson bracket with respect to the canonical variables of the fields, thus opening the possibility of studying the complete system in a canonical and relativistic coherent way.</description>

      <title>Droplet-on-demand using a positive pressure pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet generation under steady conditions is a common microfluidic method for producing biphasic systems. However, this process works only over a limited range of imposed pressure: beyond a critical value, a stable liquid jet can instead form. Furthermore, for a given geometry the pressure conditions set both the generation rate of droplets and their volume. Here, we report on-demand droplet production using a positive pressure pulse to the dispersed-phase inlet of a flow-focusing geometry. This strategy enables confined droplet generation within and beyond the pressure range observed under steady conditions, and decouples volume and production rate. In particular, elongated plugs not possible under steady conditions may be formed when the maximal pressure during the pulse reaches the jet regime. The measured volume of droplets-on-demand, as well as the onset of droplet generation are both captured with a simple model that considers hydraulic resistances. This work provides a strategy and design rules for processes that require individual droplets or elongated plugs in a simple microfluidic chip design.</description>
