      <title>Methods in complete intersections in corank one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ denote an affine algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$, with $\dim A=d\geq 3$. In the light of availability of cancellation theorems for stably free modules $P$ with $rank(P)=d-1$ (corank one), we try to implement the methods of complete intersections theory in corank zero, to the corank one case. Our conclusion is that cancellation theorems need to clean up some of the lack of minor generalities, for such an approach to work. However, we hypothesize and derive some of the consequences to complete intersections, of such hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Coefficients and Regularity of Binomial Edge Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices, and let $J_G$ denotes the corresponding binomial edge ideal in $S=\mathbb{K}[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_n]$, where $\mathbb{K}$ is a field. We show that if a vertex satisfies a certain degree condition, then some Hilbert coefficients remain unchanged upon its removal, thereby providing a reduction technique for computing Hilbert coefficients. As an application, for any $i\geq 0$ and a pair $(r,s)$ with $r\geq 2, s\in \mathbb{Z}$, we show that there always exists a graph $G$ such that $\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)=r$ and $e_i(S/J_G)=s$, where $\mathrm{reg}(S/J_G)$ and $e_i(R/J_G)$ denote the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the $i$-th Hilbert coefficient of $S/J_G$, respectively. In particular, this demonstrates that there is no inherent relationship between the regularity and the Hilbert coefficients for the class of binomial edge ideals.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Khovanskii bases and MUVAK bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2019, Kaveh and Manon introduced Khovanskii bases as a special 'Gr\"obner-like' generating system of an algebra. We extend their work by considering an arbitrary grading on the algebra and propose a definition for a 'homogeneous Khovanskii basis' that respects this grading. We generalize Khovanskii bases further by taking multiple valuations into account (MUVAK bases). We give algorithms in both cases.
  MUVAK bases appear in the computation of the Cox ring of a minimal model of a quotient singularity. Our algorithm is an improvement of an algorithm by Yamagishi in this situation.</description>

      <title>Locally Associated Orders in Real Quadratic Number Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2025, the concept of an order in a number field being associated, ideal-preserving, or locally associated was introduced in order to tackle problems in factorization. In this paper, we explore locally associated orders in real quadratic number fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{p}]$, with $p\in\mathbb{N}$ prime. In particular, we develop strategies and produce results which make determining when a given order in such a number field is (or is not) locally associated much easier. We also highlight the relatively few cases which defy simple characterization, leading to a conjecture on the solutions to Pell's equations of the form $x^2-y^2p=1$.</description>

      <title>Divisibility Relations and $\mathcal{D}$-Extremal ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A divisibility relation between the generators of a square-free monomial ideal formally encodes the situation when one generator divides the least common multiple of some other generators. The divisibility relations contribute to the deletion of some parts of the Taylor resolution of the ideal, and therefore lead to finding a resolution closer to the minimal one. Motivated by this observation, for a given set $\mathcal{D}$ of divisibility relations, we study all square-free monomials satisfying the relations in $\mathcal{D}$. We define a class of square-free monomial ideals called $\mathcal{D}$-extremal ideals $\mathcal{E}_\mathcal{D}$ , and show it is optimal in the sense that it is an ideal satisfying exactly those divisibility relations coming from $\mathcal{D}$, and no others. We then show that $\mathcal{E}_\mathcal{D}$ is extremal in the sense that the resolution and betti numbers of the powers of any square-free monomial ideal satisfying the relations in $\mathcal{D}$ are bounded by those of the same powers of $\mathcal{E}_\mathcal{D}$.</description>
