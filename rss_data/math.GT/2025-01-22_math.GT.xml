      <title>An equivariant Laudenbach-Po\'enaru theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A foundational theorem of Laudenbach and Po\'enaru states that any diffeomorphism of $\#^n(S^1\times S^2)$ extends to a diffeomorphism of $\natural^n(S^1\times B^3)$. We prove a generalization of this theorem that accounts for the presence of a finite group action on $\#^n(S^1\times S^2)$. Our proof is independent of the classical theorem, so by considering the trivial group action, we give a new proof of the classical theorem.
  Specifically, we show that any finite group action on $\#^n(S^1\times S^2)$ extends to a $\textit{linearly parted}$ action on $\natural^n(S^1\times B^3)$ and that any two such extensions are equivariantly diffeomorphic. Roughly, a linearly parted action respects a decomposition into equivariant $0$-handles and $1$-handles, where, for each handle in the decomposition, its stabilizer acts linearly on that handle. The restriction to linearly parted actions is important, because there are infinitely many distinct nonlinear actions on $B^4$ with identical actions on $\partial B^4$; these nonlinear actions give extensions of the same action on $\partial B^4$ which are $\textit{not}$ equivariantly diffeomorphic.
  We also prove a more general theorem: Every finite group action on $\left(\#^n(S^1\times S^2),L\right)$, with $L$ an invariant unlink, extends across a pair $\left(\natural^n(S^1\times B^3),\mathcal{D}\right)$, with $\mathcal{D}$ an equivariantly boundary-parallel disk-tangle, and any two such extensions are equivariantly diffeomorphic.</description>

      <title>Homology inclusion of complex line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new topological invariant of complex line arrangements in $\mathbb{CP}^2$, derived from the interaction between their complement and the boundary of a regular neighbourhood. The motivation is to identify Zariski pairs which have the same combinatorics but different embeddings. Building on ideas developed by B. Guerville-Ball\'e and W. Cadiegan-Schlieper, we consider the inclusion map of the boundary manifold to the exterior and its effect on homology classes. A careful study of the graph Waldhausen structure of the boundary manifold allows to identify specific generators of the homology. Their potential images are encoded in a group, the graph stabiliser, with a nice combinatorial presentation. The invariant related to the inclusion map is an element of this group. Using a computer implementation in Sage, we compute the invariant for some examples and exhibit new Zariski pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalization of the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface that is generated by loops and arcs between marked points on the interior or boundary, up to skein relations defined by Muller and Roger-Yang. We compute the center of this Muller-Roger-Yang skein algebra and show that it is almost Azumaya when the quantum parameter $q$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity with odd $n$. We also discuss the implications on the representation theory of the Muller-Roger-Yang generalized skein algebra.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer homology and the word metric on the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a relationship between the Heegaard Floer homology correction terms of integral homology spheres and the word metric on the Torelli group. For example, we give an elementary proof that the Cayley graph of the Torelli group has infinite diameter in the word metric induced by the generating set of all separating twists and bounding pair maps. On the other hand, we show that many subsets of the Torelli group are bounded with respect to this metric. Finally, we address the case of rational homology spheres by ruling out a certain Morita-type formula for congruence subgroups of mapping class groups.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of diffeomorphism groups of manifold pairs -- Circle case --</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study boundedness of conjugation invariant norms on diffeomorphism groups of manifold pairs. For the diffeomorphism group ${\mathcal D} \equiv {\rm Diff}(M,N)_0$ of a closed manifold pair $(M, N)$ with $\dim N \geq 1$, first we clarify the relation among the fragmentation norm, the conjugation generated norm, the commutator length $cl$ and the commutator length with support in balls $clb$ and show that ${\mathcal D}$ is weakly simple relative to a union of some normal subgroups of ${\mathcal D}$. For the boundedness of these norms, this paper focuses on the case where $N$ is a union of $m$ circles. In this case, the rotation angle on $N$ induces a quasimorphism $\nu : {\rm Isot}(M, N)_0 \to {\Bbb R}^m$, which determines a subgroup $A$ of ${\Bbb Z}^m$ and a function $\widehat{\nu} : {\mathcal D} \to {\Bbb R}^m/A$. If ${\rm rank}\,A = m$, these data leads to an upper bound of $clb$ on ${\mathcal D}$ modulo the normal subgroup ${\mathcal G} \cong {\rm Diff}_c(M - N)_0$. Then, some upper bounds of $cl$ and $clb$ on ${\mathcal D}$ are obtained from those on ${\mathcal G}$. As a consequence, the group ${\mathcal D}$ is uniformly weakly simple and bounded when $\dim M \neq 2,4$. On the other hand, if ${\rm rank}\,A &lt; m$, then the group ${\mathcal D}$ admits a surjective quasimorphism, so it is unbounded and not uniformly perfect. We examine the group $A$ in some explicit examples.</description>

      <title>On the Khovanov homology of 3-braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture of Przytycki and Sazdanovic that the Khovanov homology of the closure of a 3-stranded braid only contains torsion of order 2. This conjecture has been known for six out of seven classes in the Murasugi-classification of 3-braids and we show it for the remaining class. Our proof also works for the other classes and relies on Bar-Natan's version of Khovanov homology for tangles as well as his delooping and cancellation techniques, and the reduced integral Bar-Natan--Lee--Turner spectral sequence. We also show that the Knight-move conjecture holds for 3-braids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In all dimensions $n \ge 4$ not of the form $4m+3$, we show that there exists a closed hyperbolic $n$-manifold which is not the boundary of a compact $(n+1)$-manifold. The proof relies on the relationship between the cobordism class and the fixed point set of an involution on the manifold, together with a geodesic embedding of Kolpakov, Reid and Slavich. We also outline a possible approach to cover the dimensions $4m+3 \ne 2^k-1$.</description>

As applications, we show that if $M=(S^1\times D^3)\natural \hat M$ where $\hat M$ either has the form $I\times Y$ or is a punctured aspherical manifold, then the center of the mapping class group of $M$ is of infinite rank.</description>

      <title>Families of diffeomorphisms, embeddings, and positive scalar curvature metrics via Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct infinite rank summands isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ in the higher homotopy and homology groups of the diffeomorphism groups of certain $4$-manifolds. These spherical families become trivial in the homotopy and homology groups of the homeomorphism group; an infinite rank subgroup becomes trivial after a single stabilization by connected sum with $S^2 \times S^2$. The stabilization result gives rise to an inductive construction, starting from non-isotopic but pseudoisotopic diffeomorphisms constructed by the second author in 1998. The spherical families give $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ summands in the homology of the classifying spaces of specific subgroups of those diffeomorphism groups.
  The non-triviality is shown by computations with family Seiberg-Witten invariants, including a gluing theorem adapted to our inductive construction. As applications, we we obtain infinite generation for higher homotopy and homology groups of spaces of embeddings of surfaces and $3$-manifolds in various $4$-manifolds, and for the space of positive scalar curvature metrics on standard PSC $4$-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Dehn twists about certain $k$ curves on an $n$-punctured disk generate either a free group of rank $k$ or a free product of Abelian groups, depending on the configuration of the curves. Our approach refines previously known criteria, providing a different method for detecting freeness in the mapping class group of the punctured disk. Using Dynnikov coordinates, we further present an algorithm that checks whether Dehn twists about these $k$ curves generate a free group or a free product of Abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A quantum algorithm for Khovanov homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a topological knot invariant that categorifies the Jones polynomial, recognizes the unknot, and is conjectured to appear as an observable in $4D$ supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory. Despite its rich mathematical and physical significance, the computational complexity of Khovanov homology remains largely unknown. To address this challenge, this work initiates the study of efficient quantum algorithms for Khovanov homology.
  We provide simple proofs that increasingly accurate additive approximations to the ranks of Khovanov homology are DQC1-hard, BQP-hard, and #P-hard, respectively. For the first two approximation regimes, we propose a novel quantum algorithm. Our algorithm is efficient provided the corresponding Hodge Laplacian thermalizes in polynomial time and has a sufficiently large spectral gap, for which we give numerical and analytical evidence.
  Our approach introduces a pre-thermalization procedure that allows our quantum algorithm to succeed even if the Betti numbers of Khovanov homology are much smaller than the dimensions of the corresponding chain spaces, overcoming a limitation of prior quantum homology algorithms. We introduce novel connections between Khovanov homology and graph theory to derive analytic lower bounds on the spectral gap.</description>

      <title>Growth of automorphisms of virtually special groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the speed of growth of iterates of outer automorphisms of virtually special groups, in the Haglund-Wise sense. We show that each automorphism grows either polynomially or exponentially, and that its stretch factor is an algebraic integer. For coarse-median preserving automorphisms, we show that there are only finitely many growth rates and we construct an analogue of the Nielsen-Thurston decomposition of surface homeomorphisms.
  These results are new already for right-angled Artin groups. However, even in this particular case, the proof requires studying automorphisms of arbitrary special groups in an essential way.
  As results of independent interest, we show that special groups are accessibile over centralisers, and we construct a canonical JSJ decomposition over centralisers. We also prove that, for any virtually special group $G$, the outer automorphism group ${\rm Out}(G)$ is boundary amenable, satisfies the Tits alternative, and has finite virtual cohomological dimension.</description>

      <title>Entanglement statistics of polymers in a lattice tube and unknotting of 4-plats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Knot Entropy Conjecture states that the exponential growth rate of the number of $n$-edge lattice polygons with knot-type $K$ is the same as that for unknot polygons. Moreover, the next order growth follows a power law in $n$ with an exponent that increases by one for each prime knot in the knot decomposition of $K$. We provide the first proof of this conjecture by considering knots and non-split links in tube $\mathbb{T}^*$, an $\infty \times 2\times 1$ sublattice of the simple cubic lattice. We establish upper and lower bounds relating the asymptotics of the number of $n$-edge polygons with fixed link-type in $\mathbb{T}^*$ to that of the number of $n$-edge unknots. For the upper bound, we prove that polygons can be unknotted by braid insertions. For the lower bound, we prove a pattern theorem for unknots using information from exact transfer-matrices. This work provides new knot theory results for 4-plats and new combinatorics results for lattice polygons. Connections to modelling polymers such as DNA in nanochannels are highlighted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general position map $f:K\to M$ of a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex to a $2k$-dimensional manifold (for $k=1$, of a graph to a surface) is a $\mathbb Z_2$-embedding if $|f\sigma \cap f\tau|$ is even for any non-adjacent $k$-faces $\sigma,\tau$. We present criteria for $\mathbb Z_2$-embeddability of certain $k$-dimensional complex (for $k=1$, of any graph) to $2k$-dimensional manifolds. These criteria are
  $\bullet$ a `Kuratowski-type' version of the Fulek-Kyn\v{c}l-Bikeev criteria (for $k=1$), and
  $\bullet$ a converse to the Dzhenzher-Skopenkov necessary condition (for $k&gt;1$).
  Our higher-dimensional criterion allows us to reduce the modulo 2 K\"uhnel problem on embeddings to a purely algebraic problem.
  Our proof is interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra. It is based on calculation of generators in the homology of certain configuration space (the deleted product) of certain complex (joinpower).</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic representations of 3-periodic entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diagrams enable the use of various algebraic and geometric tools for analysing and classifying knots. In this paper we introduce a new diagrammatic representation of triply periodic entangled structures (TP tangles), which are embeddings of simple curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are invariant under translations along three non-coplanar axes. As such, these entanglements can be seen as preimages of links embedded in the 3-torus $\mathbb{T}^3 = \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ in its universal cover $\mathbb{R}^3$, where two non-isotopic links in $\mathbb{T}^3$ may possess the same TP tangle preimage. We consider the equivalence of TP tangles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ through the use of diagrams representing links in $\mathbb{T}^3$. These diagrams require additional moves beyond the classical Reidemeister moves, which we define and show that they preserve ambient isotopies of links in $\mathbb{T}^3$. The final definition of a tridiagram of a link in $\mathbb{T}^3$ allows us to then consider additional notions of equivalence relating non-isotopic links in $\mathbb{T}^3$ that possess the same TP tangle preimage.</description>

Abstract: We provide the first documented examples of immersions of closed oriented manifolds which are not homologous to embeddings, thus answering a question posed by Zhenhua Liu. In these examples we show that for any representing self-transverse immersion the double points must represent a non-trivial homology class in the source manifold. We also provide examples of Steenrod representable integral homology classes which are not represented by immersions.</description>

      <title>Exotic elliptic surfaces without 1-handles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03935v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a sufficient condition that a knot-surgery or log-transformation of $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. We show that if $K$ is a knot that the bridge number is $b(K)\le 9n$, then the knot-surgery $E(n)_K$ of the elliptic surface $E(n)$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. This means that if $\gcd(p,q)=1$, and $\min\{p,q\}\le 9$, then $E(1)_{p,q}$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles. We also show that if $\gcd (p,q)=1$, $\min\{p,q\}\le 4$, then the double log-transformation $E(n)_{p,q}$ admits a handle decomposition without 1-handles for any positive integer $n$.</description>

      <title>Quantifying separability in RAAGs via representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer the question asked by Louder, McReynolds and Patel, and prove the following statement. Let L be a RAAG, H a word quasiconvex subgroup of L, then there is a finite dimensional representation of L that separates the subgroup H in the induced Zariski topology. As a corollary, we establish a polynomial upper bound on the size of the quotients used to separate H in L. This implies the same statement for a virtually special group L and, in particular, a fundamental groups of a hyperbolic 3-manifold.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. We have studied local changes of the graphs in adding these circles. These graphs are essentially so-called {\it Reeb graphs} of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Groups of order 64 and non-homeomorphic double Kodaira fibrations with the same biregular invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_b$ be a closed Riemann surface of genus $b$. We investigate finite quotients $G$ of the pure braid group on two strands $\mathsf{P}_2(\Sigma_b)$ which do not factor through $\pi_1(\Sigma_b \times \Sigma_b)$. Building on our previous work on some special systems of generators on finite groups that we called \emph{diagonal double Kodaira structures}, we prove that, if $G$ has not order $32$, then $|G| \geq 64$, and we completely classify the cases where equality holds. In the last section, as a geometric application of our algebraic results, we construct two $3$-dimensional families of double Kodaira fibrations having the same biregular invariants and the same Betti numbers but different fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Property (QT) of relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the projection complex machinery, Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, Hagen-Petyt and Han-Nguyen-Yang prove that several classes of nonpositively-curved groups admit equivariant quasi-isometric embeddings into finite products of quasi-trees, i.e. having property (QT). In this paper, we unify and generalize the above results by establishing a sufficient condition for relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups to have property (QT).
  As applications, we show that a group has property (QT) if it is residually finite and belongs to one of the following classes of groups: admissible groups, hyperbolic--$2$--decomposable groups with no distorted elements, Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type. We also introduce a slightly stronger version of property (QT), called property (QT'), and show the invariance of property (QT') under graph products.</description>
