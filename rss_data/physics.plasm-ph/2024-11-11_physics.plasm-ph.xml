      <title>A Study of Performance Portability in Plasma Physics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-performance computing (HPC) community has recently seen a substantial diversification of hardware platforms and their associated programming models. From traditional multicore processors to highly specialized accelerators, vendors and tool developers back up the relentless progress of those architectures. In the context of scientific programming, it is fundamental to consider performance portability frameworks, i.e., software tools that allow programmers to write code once and run it on different computer architectures without sacrificing performance. We report here on the benefits and challenges of performance portability using a field-line tracing simulation and a particle-in-cell code, two relevant applications in computational plasma physics with applications to magnetically-confined nuclear-fusion energy research. For these applications we report performance results obtained on four HPC platforms with server-class CPUs from Intel (Xeon) and AMD (EPYC), and high-end GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, including the latest Nvidia H100 GPU and the novel AMD Instinct MI300A APU. Our results show that both Kokkos and OpenMP are powerful tools to achieve performance portability and decent "out-of-the-box" performance, even for the very latest hardware platforms. For our applications, Kokkos provided performance portability to the broadest range of hardware architectures from different vendors.</description>

      <title>FLAIM: A reduced volume ignition model for the compression and thermonuclear burn of spherical fuel capsules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the "First Light Advanced Ignition Model" (FLAIM), a reduced model for the implosion, adiabatic compression, volume ignition and thermonuclear burn of a spherical DT fuel capsule utilising a high-Z metal pusher. FLAIM is characterised by a highly modular structure, which makes it an appropriate tool for optimisations, sensitivity analyses and parameter scans. One of the key features of the code is the 1D description of the hydrodynamic operator, which has a minor impact on the computational efficiency, but allows us to gain a major advantage in terms of physical accuracy. We demonstrate that a more accurate treatment of the hydrodynamics plays a primary role in closing most of the gap between a simple model and a general 1D rad-hydro code, and that only a residual part of the discrepancy is attributable to the heat losses. We present a detailed quantitative comparison between FLAIM and 1D rad-hydro simulations, showing good agreement over a large parameter space in terms of temporal profiles of key physical quantities, ignition maps and typical burn metrics.</description>

      <title>Analytic model for sheath-plasma resonance in inverted fireballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sheath plasma resonance (SPR) in an inverted fireball (IFB) system is semi-analytically investigated using a generalized hydrodynamic isothermal model formalism. It incorporates the constitutive ionic fluid viscosity, inter-species collisions, and geometric curvature effects. The SPR stability is studied for an anodic (hollow, meshed) IFB for the first time against the traditional cathode-plasma arrangements of regular electrode (solid, smooth) fireballs. The SPR develops near a spherical electrode enclosed by a plasma sheath amid a given electric potential. A generalized linear quartic dispersion relation (DR) with diverse plasma multi-parametric coefficients is methodically derived using a standard normal mode analysis. The mathematical construction of the obtained DR roots confirms that only one feasible nonzero frequency mode exists (emerging in the IFB). This root existence is confirmed both analytically and numerically. This consequent SPR creates trapped acoustic fluctuations in the IFB plasmas because of the internal reflections at the sheath plasma boundary. Also, sensible parametric changes in the SPR features, with both plasma density and viscosity, are seen. A local condition for the SPR excitation and its subsequent transition to collective standing wave-like patterns in the IFBs is illustrated. A fair corroboration of our results with the earlier SPR experimental observations of standing wave-like eigenmode patterns (evanescent) strengthens the reliability of our study alongside new applicability.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Mode Structure Using A Novel Physics-Embedded Neural ODE Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed a new artificial neural network by modifying the neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) framework to successfully predict the time evolution of the 2D mode profile in both the linear growth and nonlinear saturated stages. Starting from the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, simplifying assumptions were applied based on physical properties and symmetry considerations of the energetic-particle-driven geodesic acoustic mode (EGAM) to reduce complexity. Our approach embeds physical laws directly into the neural network architecture by exposing latent differential states, enabling the model to capture complex features in the nonlinear saturated stage that are difficult to describe analytically, and thus, the new artificial neural network is named as ExpNODE (Exposed latent state Neural ODE). ExpNODE was evaluated using a data set generated from first-principles simulations of the EGAM instability, focusing on the pre-saturated stage and the nonlinear saturated stage where the mode properties are most complex. Compared to state-of-the-art models such as ConvLSTM, ExpNODE with physical information not only achieved lower test loss but also converged faster during training. Specifically, it outperformed ConvLSTM method in both the 20-step and 40-step prediction horizons, demonstrating superior accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, the model exhibited strong generalization capabilities, accurately predicting mode profiles outside the training data set. Visual comparisons between model predictions and ground truth data showed that ExpNODE with physical information closely captured detailed features and asymmetries inherent in the EGAM dynamics that were not adequately captured by other models. These results suggest that integrating physical knowledge into neural ODE frameworks enhances their performance, and provides a powerful tool for modeling complex plasma phenomena.</description>

      <title>Isolated Attosecond $\gamma$-Ray Pulse Generation with Transverse Orbital Angular Momentum Using Intense Spatiotemporal Optical Vortex Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated attosecond vortex $\gamma$-ray pulse is generated by using a relativistic spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) laser in particle-in-cell simulations. A $\sim$ 300-attosecond electron slice with transverse orbital angular momentum (TOAM) is initially selected and accelerated by the central spatiotemporal singularity of the STOV laser. This slice then collides with the laser's reflected Gaussian-like front from a planar target, initiating nonlinear Compton scattering and resulting in an isolated, attosecond ($\sim$ 300 as), highly collimated ($\sim$ 4$\degree$), ultra-brilliant ($\sim 5\times 10^{24}$ photons/s/mm$^2$/mrad$^2$/0.1\%BW at 1 MeV) $\gamma$-ray pulse. This STOV-driven approach overcomes the significant beam divergence and complex two-laser requirements of prior Gaussian-based methods while introducting TOAM to the attosecond $\gamma$-ray pulse, which opens avenues for ultrafast imaging, nuclear excitation, and detection applications.</description>

      <title>Collisional charging of dust particles by suprathermal plasmas. II -- Regularized Kappa distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the velocity distribution functions of the plasma particles on the equilibrium charge of dust grains, acquired through inelastic collisions of the particles with the grains. This paper is the second in a series of two papers on the subject. Here, we consider the charging process when the plasma particles are statistically described by the recently proposed regularized Kappa distribution functions, which allow for extreme suprathermal states, characterized by extremely low values of the kappa index, previously forbidden to the standard Kappa distributions, whose effects on dust charging were studied in Paper I of this series. We analyse the effects that extreme suprathermal states of the plasma particles have on dust charging and verify conditions for the uncommon result of positive equilibrium charge, employing two different models for the regularized Kappa distributions.</description>

      <title>Latest progress on the reduced-order particle-in-cell scheme: I. refining the underlying formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The particle-in-cell (PIC) method is a well-established and widely used kinetic plasma modelling approach that provides a hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to solve the plasma kinetic equation. Despite its power in capturing details of the underlying physics of plasmas, conventional PIC implementations are associated with a significant computational cost, rendering their applications for real-world plasma science and engineering challenges impractical. The acceleration of the PIC method has thus become a topic of high interest, with several approaches having been pursued to this end. Among these, the concept of reduced-order (RO) PIC simulations, first introduced in 2023, provides a uniquely flexible and computationally efficient framework for kinetic plasma modelling - characteristics verified extensively in various plasma configurations. In this two-part article, we report the latest progress achieved on RO-PIC. Part I article revisits the original RO-PIC formulation and introduces refinements that substantially enhance the cost-efficiency and accuracy of the method. We discuss these refinements in comparison against the original formulation, illustrating the progression to a "first-order" implementation from the baseline "zeroth-order" one. In a detailed step-by-step verification, we first test the newly updated reduced-dimension Poisson solver (RDPS) in the first-order RO-PIC against its zeroth-order counterpart using test-case Poisson problems. Next, comparing against the zeroth-order version, we examine the performance of the complete first-order RO-PIC code in two-dimensional plasma problems. The detailed verifications demonstrate that the improvements in the RO-PIC formulation enable the approach to provide full-2D-equivalent results at a substantially lower (up to an order of magnitude) computational cost compared to the zeroth-order RO-PIC.</description>

      <title>Latest progress on the reduced-order particle-in-cell scheme: II. Quasi-3D implementation and verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across many plasma applications, the underlying phenomena and interactions among the involved processes are known to exhibit three-dimensional characteristics. Furthermore, the global properties and evolution of plasma systems are often determined by a process called inverse energy cascade, where kinetic plasma processes at the microscopic scale interact and lead to macroscopic coherent structures. These structures can have a major impact on the stability of plasma discharges, with detrimental effects on the operation and performance of plasma technologies. Kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) methods offer a sufficient level of fidelity to capture these processes and behaviors. However, three-dimensional PIC simulations that can cost-effectively overcome the curse of dimensionality and enable full-scale simulations of real-world time significance have remained elusive. Tackling the enormous computational cost issue associated with conventional PIC schemes, the computationally efficient reduced-order (RO) PIC approach provides a viable path to 3D simulations of real-size plasma systems. This part II paper builds upon the improvements to the RO-PIC's underpinning formulation discussed in part I and extends the novel "first-order" RO-PIC formulation to 3D. The resulting Quasi-3D (Q3D) implementation is rigorously verified in this paper, both at the module level of the Q3D reduced-dimension Poisson solver (RDPS) and at the global PIC code level. The plasma test cases employed correspond to 3D versions of the 2D configurations studied in Part I, including a 3D extension to the Diocotron instability problem. The detailed verifications of the Q3D RO-PIC confirm that it maintains the expected levels of cost-efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating the ability of the approach to indistinguishably reproduce full-3D simulation results at a fraction of the computational cost.</description>

      <title>Plasma Seismology: Fully Exploiting the Information Contained in Velocity Space of Kinetic Plasmas using the Morrison G Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly collisional plasmas contain a wealth of information about the dynamics of the plasma in the particle velocity distribution functions, yet our ability to exploit fully that information remains relatively primitive. Here we aim to present the fundamentals of a new technique denoted Plasma Seismology that aims to invert the information from measurements of the particle velocity distribution functions at a single point in space over time to enable the determination of the electric field variation over an extended spatial region. The fundamental mathematical tool at the heart of this technique is the Morrison $G$ Transform. Using kinetic numerical simulations of Langmuir waves in a Vlasov-Poisson plasma, we demonstrate the application of the standard Morrison $G$ Transform, which uses measurements of the particle velocity distribution function over all space at one time to predict the evolution of the electric field in time. Next, we introduce a modified Morrison $G$ Transform which uses measurements of the particle velocity distribution function at one point in space over time to determine the spatial variation of the electric field over an extended spatial region. We discuss the limitations of this approach, particularly for the numerically challenging case of Langmuir waves. The application of this technique to Alfven waves in a magnetized plasma holds the promise to apply the technique to existing spacecraft particle measurement instrumentation to determine the electric fields over an extended spatial region away from the spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Rarefied neutral flow in orificed hollow cathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parametric study is conducted to quantify the effect of the keeper electrode geometry on the neutral flow quantities within orificed hollow cathodes, prior to cathode ignition. The keeper impinges directly on the flow out of the cathode orifice and its geometry strongly influences the product between the pressure in the orifice-keeper region and the distance between cathode and keeper, $P_{ko}\cdot D_{ko}$, a key parameter for successful cathode ignition. A representative cathode equipped with a keeper is simulated using the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method. The numerical model is first validated with computational results from the literature, and a parametric study is then conducted. Parameters include the cathode pressure-diameter in the range of 1-5 Torr-cm and the following geometric ratios: cathode orifice-to-cathode inner radii in the range of 0.1-0.7, keeper orifice-to-cathode orifice radii in the range of 1-5, and keeper distance-to-cathode-orifice diameter, in the range of 0.5-10. If both keeper and cathode have identical orifice radii, the flow remains subsonic in the cathode orifice-to-keeper region. In most cases, however, the flow becomes underexpanded and supersonic, and the static pressure within the cathode orifice-keeper region is, on average, 4% that of the upstream pressure value. The orifice-keeper region pressure increases with either a decrease in the keeper orifice diameter or an increase in the distance between the cathode orifice plate and the keeper plate, in agreement with literature data. Trends are explained through control-volume-based conservation laws. The ratio of ignition-to-nominal mass flow rates is found to be in the range of 9-120, with a most probable value of 40, in agreement with literature data. This suggests that heater-less cathode ignition at a minimum DC voltage may be achieved by increasing the input mass flow rate by a factor of 40.</description>

      <title>Understanding Streaming Instabilities in the Limit of High Cosmic Ray Current Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical component of particle acceleration in astrophysical shocks is the non-resonant (Bell) instability, where the streaming of cosmic rays (CRs) leads to the amplification of magnetic fields necessary to scatter particles. In this work we use kinetic particle-in-cells simulations to investigate the high-CR current regime, where the typical assumptions underlying the Bell instability break down. Despite being more strongly driven, significantly less magnetic field amplification is observed compared to low-current cases, an effect due to the anisotropic heating that occurs in this regime. We also find that electron-scale modes, despite being fastest growing, mostly lead to moderate electron heating and do not affect the late evolution or saturation of the instability.</description>
