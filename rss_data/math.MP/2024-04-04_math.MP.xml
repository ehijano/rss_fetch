      <title>Average Nodal Count and the Nodal Count Condition for Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nodal edge count of an eigenvector of the Laplacian of a graph is the number of edges on which it changes sign. This quantity extends to any real symmetric $n\times n$ matrix supported on a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices. The average nodal count, averaged over all eigenvectors of a given matrix, is known to be bounded between $\frac{n-1}{2}$ and $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)$, where $\beta(G)$ is the first Betti number of $G$ (a topological quantity), and it was believed that generically the average should be around $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)/2$. We prove that this is not the case: the average is bounded between $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)/n$ and $\frac{n-1}{2}+\beta(G)-\beta(G)/n$, and we provide graphs and matrices that attain the upper and lower bounds for any possible choice of $n$ and $\beta$.
  A natural condition on a matrix for defining the nodal count is that it has simple eigenvalues and non-vanishing eigenvectors. For any connected graph $G$, a generic real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ satisfies this nodal count condition. However, the situation for constant diagonal matrices is far more subtle. We completely characterize the graphs $G$ for which this condition is generically true, and show that if this is not the case, then any real symmetric matrix supported on $G$ with constant diagonal has a multiple eigenvalue or an eigenvector that vanishes somewhere. Finally, we discuss what can be said when this nodal count condition fails, and provide examples.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for hardcore-SOS models on Cayley trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-state $p$-solid-on-solid model, for $p=\infty$, on Cayley trees of order $k\geq 2$ and establish a system of functional equations where each solution corresponds to a (splitting) Gibbs measure of the model. Our main result is that, for three states, $k=2,3$ and increasing coupling strength, the number of translation-invariant Gibbs measures behaves as $1\to3\to5\to6\to7$. This phase diagram is qualitatively similar to the one observed for three-state $p$-SOS models with $p&gt;0$ and, in the case of $k=2$, we demonstrate that, on the level of the functional equations, the transition $p\to\infty$ is continuous.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert problems, Toeplitz operators and ergosurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger Equations of Quartic Matrix Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix field theory is a combinatorially non-local field theory which has recently been found to be a non-trivial but solvable QFT example. To generalize such non-perturbative structures to other models, a more combinatorial understanding of Dyson-Schwinger equations and their solutions is of high interest. To this end we consider combinatorial Dyson-Schwinger equations manifestly relying on the Hopf-algebraic structure of perturbative renormalization. We find that these equations are fully compatible with renormalization, relying only on the superficially divergent diagrams which are planar ribbon graphs, i.e. decompleted dual combinatorial maps. Still, they are of a similar kind as in realistic models of local QFT, featuring in particular an infinite number of primitive diagrams as well as graph-dependent combinatorial factors.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goto equation from three-dimensional gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>On the pseudo-Riemann metrizability of SO(3)-symmetric Berwald-Finsler spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify, for SO(3)-symmetric 4-dimensional Berwald-Finsler spaces of indefinite signature, the question of the existence of an affinely equivalent pseudo-Riemannian metric. It turns out that the answer depends on the holonomy distribution of the canonical affine connection and on the symmetry of its Ricci tensor. In particular, we find all classes of 4-dimensional SO(3)-invariant, symmetric affine connections which do not arise as Levi-Civita connections of any pseudo-Riemannian metric, but can still be metrized by (SO(3)-symmetric) Finsler functions; in Lorentzian signature, these will provide Berwald spacetime structures whose geodesic structure cannot be ascribed to any Lorentzian metric. Some concrete examples are also presented.</description>

      <title>The Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron and Parke-Taylor identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$ is a geometric object introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang Mills. It generalizes the positive Grassmannian (when $n=k+m$), cyclic polytopes (when $k=1$), and the bounded complex of the cyclic hyperplane arrangement (when $m=1$). Of substantial interest are the tilings of the amplituhedron, which are analogous to triangulations of a polytope. Karp, Williams and Zhang (2020) observed that the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$ and the known tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,4}$ have cardinality the Narayana number $\frac{1}{n-3}{n-3 \choose k+1}{n-3 \choose k}$; generalizing these observations, they conjectured that for even $m$ the tilings of $\mathcal{A}_{n, k,m}$ have cardinality the MacMahon number, the number of plane partitions which fit inside a $k \times (n-k-m) \times \frac{m}{2}$ box. We refer to this prediction as the `Magic Number Conjecture'. In this paper we prove the Magic Number Conjecture for the $m=2$ amplituhedron: that is, we show that each tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$ has cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$. We prove this by showing that all positroid tilings of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ have cardinality ${n-2 \choose k}$, then applying T-duality. In addition, we give combinatorial necessary conditions for tiles to form a tiling of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}$; we give volume formulas for Parke-Taylor polytopes and certain positroid polytopes in terms of circular extensions of cyclic partial orders; and we prove new variants of the classical Parke-Taylor identities.</description>

      <title>Simulating Holographic Conformal Field Theories on Hyperbolic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally lead to a genuine realization of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Scaled global operators and Fueter variables on non-zero scaled hypercomplex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the rise of global operators in the scaled quaternionic case, an important extension from the quaternionic case to the family of scaled hypercomplex numbers $\mathbb{H}_t,\, t\in\mathbb{R}^*$, of which the $\mathbb{H}_{-1}=\mathbb{H}$ is the space of quaternions and $\mathbb{H}_{1}$ is the space of split quaternions. We also describe the scaled Fueter-type variables associated to these operators, developing a coherent theory in this field. We use these types of variables to build different types of function spaces on $\mathbb{H}_t$. Counterparts of the Hardy space and of the Arveson space are also introduced and studied in the present setting. The two different adjoints in the scaled hypercomplex numbers lead to two parallel cases in each instance. Finally we introduce and study the notion of rational function.</description>

      <title>From equations in coordinate space to Picard-Fuchs and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the development of a position space approach to equations for Feynman multi-loop integrals. The key idea of the approach is that unintegrated products of Greens functions in position space are still loop integral in momentum space. The natural place to start are the famous banana diagrams, which we explore in this paper. In position space, these are just products of $n$ propagators. Firstly, we explain that these functions satisfy an equation of order $2^n$. These should be compared with Picard-Fuchs equations derived for the momentum space integral. We find that the Fourier transform of the position space operator contains the Picard-Fuchs one as a rightmost factor. The order of these operators is a special issue, especially since the order in momentum space is governed by degree in $x$ in position space. For the generic mass case this factorization pattern is complicated and it seems like the order of the Fourier transformed position space operators is much bigger than that of the Picard-Fuchs. Furthermore, one may ask what happens if after factorization we take the Picard-Fuchs operators back into position space. We discover that the result is again factorized, with the rightmost factor being the original position space equation. We demonstrate how this works in examples and discuss implications for more sophisticated Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Krylov-based Adaptive-Rank Implicit Time Integrators for Stiff Problems with Application to Nonlinear Fokker-Planck Kinetic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a high order adaptive-rank implicit integrators for stiff time-dependent PDEs, leveraging extended Krylov subspaces to efficiently and adaptively populate low-rank solution bases. This allows for the accurate representation of solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. We further introduce an efficient mechanism for residual evaluation and an adaptive rank-seeking strategy that optimizes low-rank settings based on a comparison between the residual size and the local truncation errors of the time-stepping discretization. We demonstrate our approach with the challenging Lenard-Bernstein Fokker-Planck (LBFP) nonlinear equation, which describes collisional processes in a fully ionized plasma. The preservation of {the equilibrium state} is achieved through the Chang-Cooper discretization, and strict conservation of mass, momentum and energy via a Locally Macroscopic Conservative (LoMaC) procedure. The development of implicit adaptive-rank integrators, demonstrated here up to third-order temporal accuracy via diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta schemes, showcases superior performance in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, equilibrium preservation, and conservation of macroscopic moments. This study offers a starting point for developing scalable, efficient, and accurate methods for high-dimensional time-dependent problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of quantum trajectories in a time-dependent disordered environment is studied. We develop a general framework in which one can study the behavior of quantum trajectories that are obtained by repeated not-necessarily-independent but stationary measurements. Using this framework, we are able to generalize the asymptotic purification results of K\"ummerer and Maassen [KM] to the current setting. Most notably, the concept of a dark subspace from [KM] is generalized to the current setting, which enables us to lift the main theorem of [KM] to the disordered case.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the double bracket vector fields defined on compact semi-simple Lie algebras to the case of general Poisson manifolds endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian metric. We construct a generalization of the normal metric such that the above vector fields, when restricted to a symplectic leaf, become gradient vector fields. We illustrate the discussion at a variety of examples and carefully discuss complications that arise when the pseudo-Riemannian metric does not induce a non-degenerate metric on parts of the symplectic leaves.</description>

      <title>On the derivation of the linear Boltzmann equation from the nonideal Rayleigh gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper's objective is to improve the existing proof of the derivation of the Rayleigh--Boltzmann equation from the nonideal Rayleigh gas [6], yielding a far faster convergence rate. This equation is a linear version of the Boltzmann equation, describing the behavior of a small fraction of tagged particles having been perturbed from thermodynamic equilibrium. This linear equation, derived from the microscopic Newton laws as suggested by the Hilbert's sixth problem, is much better understood than the quadratic Boltzmann equation, and even enable results on long time scales for the kinetic description of gas dynamics.The present paper improves the physically poor convergence rate that had been previously proved, into a much more satisfactory rate which is more than exponentially better.</description>

      <title>Signed eigenvalue/vector distribution of complex order-three random tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the signed distribution of the eigenvalues/vectors of the complex order-three random tensor by computing a partition function of a four-fermi theory, where signs are from a Hessian determinant associated to each eigenvector. The issue of the presence of a continuous degeneracy of the eigenvectors is properly treated by a gauge-fixing. The final expression is compactly represented by a generating function, which has an expansion whose powers are the dimensions of the tensor index spaces. A crosscheck is performed by Monte Carlo simulations. By taking the large-$N$ limit we obtain a critical point where the behavior of the signed distribution qualitatively changes, and also the end of the signed distribution. The expected agreement of the end of the signed distribution with that of the genuine distribution provides a few applications, such as computing the largest eigenvalue, the geometric measure of entanglement, and the best rank-one approximation in the large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformed Gaussian unitary ensemble: spectral moments and genus-type expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenvalue probability density function of the Gaussian unitary ensemble permits a $q$-extension related to the discrete $q$-Hermite weight and corresponding $q$-orthogonal polynomials. A combinatorial counting method is used to specify a positive sum formula for the spectral moments of this model. The leading two terms of the scaled $1/N^2$ genus-type expansion of the moments are evaluated explicitly in terms of the incomplete beta function. Knowledge of these functional forms allows for the smoothed leading eigenvalue density and its first correction to be determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Three perspectives on entropy dynamics in a non-Hermitian two-state system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comparative study of entropy dynamics as an indicator of physical behavior in an open two-state system with balanced gain and loss is presented. We distinguish the perspective taken in utilizing the conventional framework of Hermitian-adjoint states from an approach that is based on biorthogonal-adjoint states and a third case based on an isospectral mapping. In this it is demonstrated that their differences are rooted in the treatment of the environmental coupling mode. For unbroken $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the system, a notable characteristic feature of the perspective taken is the presence or absence of purity oscillations, with an associated entropy revival. The description of the system is then continued from its $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric pseudo-Hermitian phase into the regime of spontaneously broken symmetry, in the latter two approaches through a non-analytic operator-based continuation, yielding a Lindblad master equation based on the $\mathcal{PT}$ charge operator $\mathcal{C}$. This phase transition indicates a general connection between the pseudo-Hermitian closed-system and the Lindbladian open-system formalism through a spontaneous breakdown of the underlying physical reflection symmetry.</description>

      <title>A quantum Pascal pyramid and an extended de Moivre-Laplace theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pascal's triangle is widely used as a pedagogical tool to explain the "first-order" multiplet patterns that arise in the spectra of $I_N S$ coupled spin-1/2 systems in magnetic resonance. Various other combinatorial structures, which may be well-known in the broader field of quantum dynamics, appear to have largely escaped the attention of the magnetic resonance community with a few exceptions, despite potential usefulness.
  In this brief set of lecture notes, we describe a "quantum Pascal pyramid" (OEIS $\href{https://oeis.org/A268533}{A268533}$) as a generalization of Pascal's triangle, which is shown to directly map the relationship between multispin operators of arbitrary spin product rank $q$ ($\hat{Z}_N^q$) and population operators for states with magnetic quantum number $m$ ($\hat{S}_N^m$), and - as a consequence - obtain the general form of the intensity ratios of multiplets associated with antiphase single-quantum coherences, with an expression given in terms of the Jacobi polynomials.
  An extension of the de Moivre-Laplace theorem, beyond the trivial case $q=0$, is applied to the $q$-th columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid, and is given in terms of a product of the $q$-th order Hermite polynomials and a Gaussian distribution, reproducing the well-known functional forms of the solutions of the quantum harmonic oscillator and the classical limit of Hermite-Gaussian modes in laser physics (Allen et al., $\textit{Phys. Rev. A.}$, $\textbf{45}$, 1992). This is used to approximate the Fourier-transformed spectra of $\hat{Z}_N^q$-associated multiplets of arbitrary complexity.
  Finally, an exercise is shown in which the first two columns of the quantum Pascal pyramid are used to calculate the previously known symmetry-constrained upper bound on $I_z \rightarrow S_z$ polarization transfer in $I_N S$ spin systems.</description>

      <title>Polytope symmetries of Feynman integrals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals appropriately generalized are $\mathsf A$-hypergeometric functions. Among the properties of $\mathsf A$-hypergeometric functions are symmetries associated with the Newton polytope. In ordinary hypergeometric functions these symmetries lead to linear transformations. Combining tools of $\mathsf A$-hypergeometric systems and the computation of symmetries of polytopes, we consider the associated symmetries of Feynman integrals in the Lee-Pomeransky representation. We compute the symmetries of $\mathtt n$-gon integrals up to $\mathtt n=8$, massive banana integrals up to 5-loop, and on-shell ladders up to 3-loop. We apply these symmetries to study finite on-shell ladder integrals up to 3-loop.</description>

      <title>Injective norm of real and complex random tensors I: From spin glasses to geometric entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The injective norm is a natural generalization to tensors of the operator norm of a matrix. In quantum information, the injective norm is one important measure of genuine multipartite entanglement of quantum states, where it is known as the geometric entanglement. In this paper, we give a high-probability upper bound on the injective norm of real and complex Gaussian random tensors, corresponding to a lower bound on the geometric entanglement of random quantum states, and to a bound on the ground-state energy of a particular multispecies spherical spin glass model. For some cases of our model, previous work used $\epsilon$-net techniques to identify the correct order of magnitude; in the present work, we use the Kac--Rice formula to give a one-sided bound on the constant which we believe to be tight.</description>

      <title>A Canonical Quantization of Poisson Manifolds: a 2-Groupoid Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We canonically quantize a Poisson manifold to a Lie 2-groupoid, complete with a quantization map, and show that it relates geometric and deformation quantization: the perturbative expansion in $\hbar$ of the (formal) convolution of two quantized functions yields Kontsevich's star product. Meanwhile, we can push forward this quantization map (by integrating over homotopies of paths) to obtain a quantization map in traditional geometric quantization. This gives a polarization-free, path integral definition of the quantization map, which does not have a prior definition for Poisson manifolds, and which only has a partial prescription for symplectic manifolds. We construct conventional quantum mechanics from this perspective.</description>

Abstract: We consider a gas of N weakly interacting bosons in the ground state. Such gases exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation. The binding energy is defined as the energy it takes to remove one particle from the gas. In this article, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the binding energy, and compute the first orders explicitly for the homogeneous gas. Our result addresses in particular a conjecture by Nam [Lett. Math. Phys., 108(1):141--159, 2018], and provides an asymptotic expansion of the ionization energy of bosonic atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The moments of the real eigenvalues of real Ginibre matrices are investigated from the viewpoint of explicit formulas, differential and difference equations, and large $N$ expansions. These topics are inter-related. For example, a third order differential equation can be derived for the density of the real eigenvalues, and this can be used to deduce a second order difference equation for the general complex moments $M_{2p}^{\rm r}$. The latter are expressed in terms of the ${}_3 F_2$ hypergeometric functions, with a simplification to the ${}_2 F_1$ hypergeometric function possible for $p=0$ and $p=1$, allowing for the large $N$ expansion of these moments to be obtained. The large $N$ expansion involves both integer and half integer powers of $1/N$. The three term recurrence then provides the large $N$ expansion of the full sequence $\{ M_{2p}^{\rm r} \}_{p=0}^\infty$. Fourth and third order linear differential equations are obtained for the moment generating function and for the Stieltjes transform of the real density, respectively, and properties of the large $N$ expansion of these quantities are determined.</description>

      <title>B\"ottcher-Wenzel inequality for weighted Frobenius norms and its application to quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By employing a weighted Frobenius norm with a positive matrix $\omega$, we introduce natural generalizations of the famous B\"ottcher-Wenzel (BW) inequality. Based on the combination of the weighted Frobenius norm $\|A\|_\omega := \sqrt{{\rm tr}(A^\ast A \omega)}$ and the standard Frobenius norm $\|A\| := \sqrt{{\rm tr}(A^\ast A)}$, there are exactly five possible generalizations, labeled (i) through (v), for the bounds on the norms of the commutator $[A,B]:= AB - BA$. In this paper, we establish the tight bounds for cases (iii) and (v), and propose conjectures regarding the tight bounds for cases (i) and (ii). Additionally, the tight bound for case (iv) is derived as a corollary of case (i). All these bounds (i)-(v) serve as generalizations of the BW inequality. The conjectured bounds for cases (i) and (ii) (and thus also (iv)) are numerically supported for matrices up to size $n=15$. Proofs are provided for $n=2$ and certain special cases. Interestingly, we find applications of these bounds in quantum physics, particularly in the contexts of the uncertainty relation and open quantum dynamics.</description>

This decomposition contains the representations that appeared in the decomposition of $\mathfrak{ad}^{\otimes 4}$ and only one new representation $X_5$. The dimension of this representation has been proposed in [A.J.Macfarlane, H.Pfeiffer, J.Phys.A: Math. Gen. 36 (2003) 2305]. Our decomposition is valid for all Lie algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01282v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a conjecture by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa for a wide class of plumbed 3-manifolds. Their conjecture states that Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT) invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed 3-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. The most difficult point in our proof is to prove the vanishing of weighted Gauss sums that appear in coefficients of negative degree in asymptotic expansions of homological blocks. To deal with it, we develop a new technique for asymptotic expansions, which enables us to compare asymptotic expansions of rational functions and false theta functions related to WRT invariants and homological blocks, respectively. In our technique, our vanishing results follow from holomorphy of such rational functions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a natural measure on bi-infinite random walk trajectories evolving in a time-dependent environment driven by the Langevin dynamics associated to a gradient Gibbs measure with convex potential. We derive an identity relating the occupation times of the Poissonian cloud induced by this measure to the square of the corresponding gradient field, which - generically - is not Gaussian. In the quadratic case, we recover a well-known generalization of the second Ray-Knight theorem. We further determine the scaling limits of the various objects involved in dimension 3, which are seen to exhibit homogenization. In particular, we prove that the renormalized square of the gradient field converges under appropriate rescaling to the Wick-ordered square of a Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with suitable diffusion matrix, thus extending a celebrated result of Naddaf and Spencer regarding the scaling limit of the field itself.</description>

Abstract: We extend three related results from the analysis of influences of Boolean functions to the quantum setting, namely the KKL Theorem, Friedgut's Junta Theorem and Talagrand's variance inequality for geometric influences. Our results are derived by a joint use of recently studied hypercontractivity and gradient estimates. These generic tools also allow us to derive generalizations of these results in a general von Neumann algebraic setting beyond the case of the quantum hypercube, including examples in infinite dimensions relevant to quantum information theory such as continuous variables quantum systems. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results as regards to noncommutative extensions of isoperimetric type inequalities, quantum circuit complexity lower bounds and the learnability of quantum observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing the Casimir force and energy between objects is a classical problem of quantum theory going back to the 1940s. Several different approaches have been developed in the literature often based on different physical principles. Most notably a representation of the Casimir energy in terms of determinants of boundary layer operators makes it accessible to a numerical approach. In this paper, we first give an overview of the various methods and discuss the connection to the Krein-spectral shift function and computational aspects. We propose variants of Krylov subspace methods for the computation of the Casimir energy for large-scale problems and demonstrate Casimir computations for several complex configurations. This allows for Casimir energy calculation for large-scale practical problems and significantly speeds up the computations in that case.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this review it to present a renewed perspective of the problem of self-gravitating elastic bodies under spherical symmetry. It is also a companion to the papers [Phys. Rev. D105, 044025 (2022)], [Phys. Rev. D106, L041502 (2022)], and [arXiv:2306.16584 [gr-qc]], where we introduced a new definition of spherically symmetric elastic bodies in general relativity, and applied it to investigate the existence and physical viability, including radial stability, of static self-gravitating elastic balls. We focus on elastic materials that generalize fluids with polytropic, linear, and affine equations of state, and discuss the symmetries of the energy density function, including homogeneity and the resulting scale invariance of the TOV equations. By introducing invariant characterizations of physical admissible initial data, we numerically construct mass-radius-compactness diagrams, and conjecture about the maximum compactness of stable physically admissible elastic balls.</description>

      <title>Exact Mazur bounds in the pair-flip model and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By mapping the calculation of Mazur bounds to the enumeration of walks on fractal structures, we present exact bounds on the late-time behavior of spin autocorrelation functions in models exhibiting pair-flip dynamics and more general $p$-flip dynamics. While the pair-flip model is known to exhibit strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the effect of its nontrivial conservation laws on autocorrelation functions has, thus far, only been calculated numerically, which has led to incorrect conclusions about their thermodynamic behavior. Here, using exact results, we prove that infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions exhibit infinite coherence times at the boundary, and that bulk Mazur bounds decay asymptotically as $1/\sqrt{L}$, rather than $1/L$, as had previously been thought. This result implies that the nontrivial conserved operators implied by $p$-flip dynamics have an important qualitative impact on bulk thermalization properties beyond the constraints imposed by the simple global symmetries of the models.</description>

      <title>Rational Q-systems at Root of Unity I. Closed Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solution of Bethe ansatz equations for XXZ spin chain with the parameter $q$ being a root of unity is infamously subtle. In this work, we develop the rational $Q$-system for this case, which offers a systematic way to find all physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations at root of unity. The construction contains two parts. In the first part, we impose additional constraints to the rational $Q$-system. These constraints eliminate the so-called Fabricius-McCoy (FM) string solutions, yielding all primitive solutions. In the second part, we give a simple procedure to construct the descendant tower of any given primitive state. The primitive solutions together with their descendant towers constitute the complete Hilbert space. We test our proposal by extensive numerical checks and apply it to compute the torus partition function of the 6-vertex model at root of unity.</description>

      <title>Interactions Between Different Birds of Prey as a Random Point Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Coulomb gas is a one-parameter family of random point processes, depending on the inverse temperature $\beta$. Based on previous work, it is proposed as a simple statistical measure to quantify the intra- and interspecies repulsion among three different highly territorial birds of prey. Using data from the area of the Teutoburger Wald over 20 years, we fit the nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions between the respective nests of Goshawk, Eagle Owl and the previously examined Common Buzzard to $\beta$ of the Coulomb gas. Within each species, the repulsion measured in this way deviates significantly from the Poisson process of independent points in the plane. In contrast, the repulsion amongst each of two species is found to be considerably lower and closer to Poisson. Methodologically we investigate the influence of the terrain, of a shorter interaction range given by the two-dimensional Yukawa interaction, and the statistical independence of the time moving average we use for the yearly ensembles of occupied nests. We also check that an artificial random displacement of the original nest positions of the order of the mean level spacing quickly destroys the repulsion measured by $\beta&gt; 0$. A simple, approximate analytical expression for the nearest neighbour spacing distribution derived from non-Hermitian random matrix theory proves to be very useful.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Equipartition Theorem for General Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Does the quantum equipartition theorem truly exist for any given system? If so, what is the concrete form of such a theorem? The extension of the equipartition theorem, a fundamental principle in classical statistical physics, to the quantum regime raises these two crucial questions. In the present Letter, we focus on how to answer them for arbitray systems. For this propose, the inverse problem of the quantum equipartition theorem has been successfully solved. This result, termed as the inverse equipartition theorem, toghther with nonnegativity and normalizability of the distribution function $\mathbb{P}(\omega)$ serves as a criterion for determining whether a given system adheres to quantum equipartition theorem. If yes, the concrete form of the theorem can be readily obtained. Fermionic version of them is also discussed.Our results can be viewed as a general solution to the topics of quantum equipartition theorem.</description>

      <title>Local near-field scattering data enables unique reconstruction of rough electric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The focus of this paper is the study of the inverse point-source scattering problem, specifically in relation to a certain class of electric potentials. Our research provides a novel uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data, obtained from the near field pattern. Our work improves the work of Caro and Garcia, who investigated both the direct problem and the inverse problem with global near field data for critically singular and $\delta$-shell potentials. The primary contribution of our research is the introduction of a Runge approximation result for the near field data on the scattering problem which, in combination with an interior regularity argument, enables us to establish a uniqueness result for the inverse problem with local data. Additionaly, we manage to consider a slightly wider class of potentials.</description>

      <title>Critical loop models are exactly solvable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional critical loop models, including the $O(n)$ and Potts models, the spectrum is exactly known, as are a few structure constants or ratios thereof. Using numerical conformal bootstrap methods, we study $235$ of the simplest 4-point structure constants. For each structure constant, we find an analytic expression as a product of two factors: 1) a universal function of conformal dimensions, built from Barnes' double Gamma function, and 2) a polynomial function of loop weights, whose degree obeys a simple upper bound. We conjecture that all structure constants are of this form.
  For a few 4-point functions, we build corresponding observables in a lattice loop model. From numerical lattice results, we extract amplitude ratios that depend neither on the lattice size nor on the lattice coupling. These ratios agree with the corresponding ratios of 4-point structure constants.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the staggered six-vertex model with $U_q\big(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\big)$ invariant boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling limit of a statistical system, which is a special case of the integrable inhomogeneous six-vertex model. It possesses $U_q\big(\mathfrak{sl}(2)\big)$ invariance due to the choice of open boundary conditions imposed. An interesting feature of the lattice theory is that the spectrum of scaling dimensions contains a continuous component. By applying the ODE/IQFT correspondence and the method of the Baxter $Q$ operator the corresponding density of states is obtained. In addition, the partition function appearing in the scaling limit of the lattice model is computed, which may be of interest for the study of nonrational CFTs in the presence of boundaries. As a side result of the research, a simple formula for the matrix elements of the $Q$ operator for the general, integrable, inhomogeneous six-vertex model was discovered, that has not yet appeared in the literature. It is valid for a certain one parameter family of diagonal open boundary conditions in the sector with the $z\,$-projection of the total spin operator being equal to zero.</description>

      <title>From the Choi Formalism in Infinite Dimensions to Unique Decompositions of Generators of Completely Positive Dynamical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any separable complex Hilbert space, any trace-class operator $B$ which does not have purely imaginary trace, and any generator $L$ of a norm-continuous one-parameter semigroup of completely positive maps we prove that there exists a unique bounded operator $K$ and a unique completely positive map $\Phi$ such that (i) $L=K(\cdot)+(\cdot)K^*+\Phi$, (ii) the superoperator $\Phi(B^*(\cdot)B)$ is trace class and has vanishing trace, and (iii) ${\rm tr}(B^*K)$ is a real number. Central to our proof is a modified version of the Choi formalism which relates completely positive maps to positive semi-definite operators. We characterize when this correspondence is injective and surjective, respectively, which in turn explains why the proof idea of our main result cannot extend to non-separable Hilbert spaces. In particular, we find examples of positive semi-definite operators which have empty pre-image under the Choi formalism as soon as the underlying Hilbert space is infinite-dimensional.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the one-point density of Hele-Shaw $\beta$-ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we prove equicontinuity for the family of one-point densities with respect to a two-dimensional Coulomb gas at an inverse temperature $\beta\ge 1/2$ confined by an external potential of Hele-Shaw (or quasi-harmonic) type. As a consequence, subsequential limiting Lipschitz continuous densities are defined on the microscopic scale. There are several additional results, for example comparing the one-point density with the thermal equilibrium density.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolved Measures in Quantum Field Theory: a Short Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short review we present the key definitions, ideas and techniques involved in the study of symmetry resolved entanglement measures, with a focus on the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy. In order to be able to define such entanglement measures, it is essential that the theory under study possess an internal symmetry. Then, symmetry resolved entanglement measures quantify the contribution to a particular entanglement measure that can be associated to a chosen symmetry sector. Our review focuses on conformal (gapless/massless/critical) and integrable (gapped/massive) quantum field theories, where the leading computational technique employs symmetry fields known as (composite) branch point twist fields.</description>
