      <title>SSL-SE-EEG: A Framework for Robust Learning from Unlabeled EEG Data with Self-Supervised Learning and Squeeze-Excitation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurological diagnostics, but its real-world deployment faces challenges due to noise artifacts, missing data, and high annotation costs. We introduce SSL-SE-EEG, a framework that integrates Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Nets) to enhance feature extraction, improve noise robustness, and reduce reliance on labeled data. Unlike conventional EEG processing techniques, SSL-SE-EEG} transforms EEG signals into structured 2D image representations, suitable for deep learning. Experimental validation on MindBigData, TUH-AB, SEED-IV and BCI-IV datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy (91% in MindBigData, 85% in TUH-AB), making it well-suited for real-time BCI applications. By enabling low-power, scalable EEG processing, SSL-SE-EEG presents a promising solution for biomedical signal analysis, neural engineering, and next-generation BCIs.</description>

      <title>Low-Latency Neural Inference on an Edge Device for Real-Time Handwriting Recognition from EEG Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved 89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency, and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.</description>

      <title>MATLAB-Simulated Dataset for Automatic Modulation Classification in Wireless Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modulation classification is a core challenge in cognitive radio, adaptive communications, spectrum analysis, and related domains, especially under dynamic channels without transmitter knowledge. To address this need, this article presents a labeled synthetic dataset designed for wireless modulation classification under realistic propagation scenarios. The signals were generated in MATLAB by modulating randomly generated bitstreams using five digital modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. These signals were then transmitted through Rayleigh and Rician fading channels with standardized parameters, along with additional impairments to enhance realism and diversity. Each modulated signal contains 1000 symbols. A comprehensive set of features was extracted from the signals, encompassing statistical, time-domain, frequency-domain, spectrogram-based, spectral correlation-based, and image-processing-based descriptors such as BRISK, MSER, and GLCM. The dataset is organized into 10 CSV files covering two channel types (Rayleigh and Rician) across five sampling frequencies: 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 500 MHz, and 1 GHz. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further experimentation, the MATLAB scripts used for signal generation and feature extraction are also provided. This dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating machine learning models in modulation classification, signal identification, and wireless communication research.</description>

      <title>NanoHydra: Energy-Efficient Time-Series Classification at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) on extreme edge devices represents a stepping stone towards intelligent sensor nodes that preserve user privacy and offer real-time predictions. Resource-constrained devices require efficient TinyML algorithms that prolong the device lifetime of battery-operated devices without compromising the classification accuracy. We introduce NanoHydra, a TinyML TSC methodology relying on lightweight binary random convolutional kernels to extract meaningful features from data streams. We demonstrate our system on the ultra-low-power GAP9 microcontroller, exploiting its eight-core cluster for the parallel execution of computationally intensive tasks. We achieve a classification accuracy of up to 94.47% on ECG5000 dataset, comparable with state-of-the-art works. Our efficient NanoHydra requires only 0.33 ms to accurately classify a 1-second long ECG signal. With a modest energy consumption of 7.69 uJ per inference, 18x more efficient than the state-of-the-art, NanoHydra is suitable for smart wearable devices, enabling a device lifetime of over four years.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Task Execution and Data Reconstruction in Multi-User Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has gained significant attention with the advances in machine learning. Most semantic communication works focus on either task execution or data reconstruction, with some recent works combining the two. In this work, we propose a semantic communication system for concurrent task execution and data reconstruction for a multi-user scenario, which we formulate as the maximization of mutual information. To investigate the trade-off between the two objectives, we formulate a joint objective as a convex combination of task execution and data reconstruction. We show that under specific assumptions, the \ac{SSIM} loss can be obtained from the mutual information maximization objective for data reconstruction, which takes human visual perception into account. Furthermore, for constant resource use, we show that by increasing the weight of the reconstruction objective up to a certain point, the task execution performance can be kept nearly constant, while the data reconstruction can be significantly improved.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided mmWave O-RAN: Coverage Extension and User Mobility Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can redirect electromagnetic waves to desired directions to enhance signal coverage and/or improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user equipment (UE). We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an RIS-assisted O-RAN 5G system operating in the FR2 millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We first introduce the design of 1,024 element (32 $\times$ 32) 1-bit RIS operating at the 28 GHz band, utilizing a modular and scalable tiled architecture. Then we demonstrate how the O-RAN E2 interface can be leveraged to dynamically control RIS configurations without modifying standard 5G signaling procedures. To evaluate the RIS-assisted 5G system, we conducted extensive field trials in both indoor and outdoor environments. The results of the O-RAN link coverage trials show that the deployed RIS provides substantial received signal power gains, ranging from 9 to 20 dB and 6 to 18 dB in indoor and outdoors scenarios, respectively. Handling UE mobility in RIS-assisted systems is challenging due to the need for joint RIS and UE beam management. For that, we develop two UE mobility management algorithms and evaluate them in real-time operation using the RIS O-RAN testbed. These algorithms leverage the received signal power at the UE to jointly track and adapt the RIS and UE beams in real time as the UE moves. The findings draw important insights into the practical feasibility of integrating RIS into O-RAN systems to enhance coverage, mobility support, and link reliability in next-generation cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Signal Design for OTFS Dual-Functional Radar and Communications with Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC). However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS, incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework. Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for communication.</description>

      <title>Active Localization of Close-range Adversarial Acoustic Sources for Underwater Data Center Surveillance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater data infrastructures offer natural cooling and enhanced physical security compared to terrestrial facilities, but are susceptible to acoustic injection attacks that can disrupt data integrity and availability. This work presents a comprehensive surveillance framework for localizing and tracking close-range adversarial acoustic sources targeting offshore infrastructures, particularly underwater data centers (UDCs). We propose a heterogeneous receiver configuration comprising a fixed hydrophone mounted on the facility and a mobile hydrophone deployed on a dedicated surveillance robot. While using enough arrays of static hydrophones covering large infrastructures is not feasible in practice, off-the-shelf approaches based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) filtering fail to generalize for this dynamic configuration. To address this, we formulate a Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme to generate acoustically informed and geometrically consistent priors, ensuring a physically plausible initial state for a joint TDOA-FDOA filtering. We integrate this into an unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline, which provides reliable convergence under nonlinearity and measurement noise. Extensive Monte Carlo analyses, Gazebo-based physics simulations, and field trials demonstrate that the proposed framework can reliably estimate the 3D position and velocity of an adversarial acoustic attack source in real time. It achieves sub-meter localization accuracy and over 90% success rates, with convergence times nearly halved compared to baseline methods. Overall, this study establishes a geometry-aware, real-time approach for acoustic threat localization, advancing autonomous surveillance capabilities of underwater infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves' characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed. Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements, thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the actual target.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Joint Space-Time-Frequency Domain Channel Prediction for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising technology for the six generation (6G) communication systems. Channel prediction will play an important role in obtaining the accurate CSI to improve the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. This paper studies a deep learning (DL) based joint space-time-frequency domain channel prediction for CF-mMIMO. Firstly, the prediction problems are formulated, which can output the multi-step prediction results in parallel without error propagation. Then, a novel channel prediction model is proposed, which adds frequency convolution (FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder. It is able to utilize the space-time-frequency correlations and extract the space correlation in the irregular AP deployment. Next, simulated datasets with different sizes of service areas, UE velocities and scenarios are generated, and correlation analysis and cross-validation are used to determine the optimal hyper-parameters. According to the optimized hyper-parameters, the prediction accuracy and computational complexity are evaluated based on simulated datasets. It is indicated that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is higher than traditional model, and its computational complexity is lower than traditional Transformer model. After that, the impacts of space-time-frequency correlations on prediction accuracy are studied. Finally, realistic datasets in a high-speed train (HST) long-term evolution (LTE) network are collected to verify the prediction accuracy. The verification results demonstrate that it also achieves higher prediction accuracy compared with traditional models in the HST LTE network.</description>

      <title>NOMA for Visible Light Communications: Recent Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly increasing demand for high speed data is pushing 6G wireless networks to support larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency. Visible light communications (VLC) is a strong complement to radio frequency (RF) systems within 6G. The latest ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb standards are adapted from cable and RF wireless technologies for use in VLC, so they do not fully exploit the optical nature of light links. VLC links are often asymmetric between uplink and downlink, which makes TDMA style protocols inefficient when many users generate bursty and asymmetric traffic. Compared with RF, the strong directionality and frequent line of sight in VLC can mitigate hidden and exposed terminals, yet these effects can still appear under limited field of view, blockage, or reflections. CSMA/CA and related methods remain usable in VLC and in RF plus VLC networks, but they usually need design tweaks such as RTS/CTS or directional sensing to perform well. Although the optical spectrum is vast, the bandwidth of practical LEDs and of common PIN or APD receivers is limited, so efficient multiple access can yield large gains. This motivates a clean slate design for VLC, especially at the MAC layer. NOMA, first explored in 5G RF systems, is also promising for 6G VLC. It lets multiple users share the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference. This paper reviews progress in VLC and in NOMA based VLC, outlines key optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios that fit NOMA in VLC, and points to several directions for future work.</description>

      <title>A Survey of OTFS-Based Index Modulation Techniques: Challenges, Benefits, and Future Directions for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation technique that uses the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and is a candidate for providing robust, high-capacity wireless communications for envisioned 6G and beyond networks. The OTFS technique maps data to the DD domain instead of the traditional time-frequency domain, enabling it to fully utilize channel diversity and transform fast time-varying channels into nearly static channels. Index modulation (IM) is a communication paradigm that conveys information not only through conventional modulation symbols but also by encoding data bits in the indices of the selected communication resources to improve error performance, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. In this survey, a comprehensive review of work on OTFS-based wireless communication systems is presented. In particular, the existing OTFS-IM schemes are reviewed and systematically categorized according to their system architectures, detection methods, and performance aspects such as capacity, peak-to-average power ratio, diversity, complexity, imperfect channel state information, spectral efficiency, and outage probability. Furthermore, the operating principles and system models of OTFS-IM variants-including OTFS-based space shift keying, OTFS-based spatial modulation, OTFS-based quadrature spatial modulation, OTFS-based media-based modulation, and OTFS-based code index modulation-are described, followed by a comparative performance analysis in terms of computational complexity, error performance, capacity, energy saving, spectral efficiency, and throughput. Finally, the challenges, benefits, and future directions for OTFS-IM systems are discussed, covering key aspects such as complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints, synchronization, security, and potential integration with other advanced wireless communication techniques.</description>

      <title>Near-Field 3D Localization and MIMO Channel Estimation with Sub-Connected Planar Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of channel estimation and 3D localization algorithms in a challenging scenario, where a sub-connected planar extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communicates with multi-antenna users. In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full column rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing codebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case but limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a three-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into subarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about subarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based dictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and employing one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate the central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion. Finally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined location-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using SBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation and Passive Beamforming for Pixel-based Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Non-Separable State Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ a novel design to achieve high reflection gain at a lower hardware cost by eliminating the phase shifters used in traditional RIS. However, this design presents challenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its non-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS state vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various baselines across a wide SNR range.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Inspired AI-based MIMO receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) detection method that treats each transmit layer as a token and learns inter-stream interference via a lightweight self-attention mechanism. Queries and keys are derived directly from the estimated channel matrix, so attention scores quantify channel correlation. Values are initialized by matched-filter outputs and iteratively refined. The AttDet design combines model-based interpretability with data-driven flexibility. We demonstrate through link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models and high-order, mixed QAM modulation and coding schemes, that AttDet can approach near-optimal BER/BLER (Bit Error Rate/Block Error Rate) performance while maintaining predictable, polynomial complexity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Medium Access Control for Low-Latency Industrial M2M Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical for enabling low-latency and reliable communication in industrial Machine-to-Machine (M2M) net-works, where timely data delivery is essential for seamless operation. The presence of multi-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the challenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often makes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a comprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of performance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their relative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of Contention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based, FROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority traffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated back-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early transmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic. Simulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two traffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority heterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both in terms of delay and throughput.</description>

      <title>Inference-Optimal ISAC via Task-Oriented Feature Transmission and Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the coordination gain in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under a compress-and-estimate (CE) framework, wherein inference performance is leveraged as the key metric. To enable tractable transceiver design and resource optimization, we characterize inference performance via an error probability bound as a monotonic function of the discriminant gain (DG). This raises the natural question of whether maximizing DG, rather than minimizing mean squared error (MSE), can yield better inference performance. Closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and MSE-optimal transceiver designs are derived, revealing water-filling-type structures and explicit sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) tradeoff. Numerical experiments confirm that DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient transmission, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by selectively allocating power to informative features and thus saving transmit power for sensing.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Frequency-Diverse and Dispersion Effects in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna for Holographic Sensing and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel approach to programmable and affordable electromagnetic wave manipulation for enhanced wireless communications, sensing, and imaging applications. Nevertheless, current DMA designs and models are usually quasi-narrowband, neglecting the versatile frequency-diverse manifestation and its utilization. This work demonstrates the frequency-diversity and dispersion operations of a representative DMA structure at the millimeter-wave band. We demonstrate flexible dispersion manipulation through dynamic holographic reconfigurability of the meta-atoms in a DMA. This effect can create distinct radiation patterns across the operating frequency band, achieving flexible frequency diversity with enhanced scanning range within a compact, reconfigurable platform. It eliminates the need for wideband systems or complex phase-shifting networks while offering an alternative to frequency-scanned static beams of traditional leaky-wave antennas. The results establish fundamental insights into modelling and utilization of dispersive effects of DMAs in next-generation near-field and far-field holographic sensing and computational holographic imaging applications.</description>

      <title>An Accelerated Mixed Weighted-Unweighted MMSE Approach for MU-MIMO Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precoding design based on weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization is a fundamental problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in the number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its application in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent framework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block coordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely on matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU acceleration. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the WSR maximization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage warm-start strategy grounded in the sum mean-square error (MSE) minimization problem to accelerate convergence. We refer to our method as the Accelerated Mixed weighted-unweighted sum-MSE minimization (A-MMMSE) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MMMSE matches the WSR performance of both conventional WMMSE and its enhanced variant, reduced-WMMSE, while achieving a substantial reduction in computational time across diverse system configurations.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of End-to-End LEO Satellite-Aided Shore-to-Ship Communications: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network (LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process (BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the performance of LEO-SSCN.</description>

      <title>Time-series Random Process Complexity Ranking Using a Bound on Conditional Differential Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future observations given past context. However, its direct computation for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable. This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices.
  To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to recover the known complexity ordering.
  This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models, that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has driven the development of roadway wireless charging technology, effectively extending EV driving range. However, wireless charging introduces significant cybersecurity challenges. Any receiver within the magnetic field can potentially extract energy, and previous research demonstrated that a hacker could detect the operating frequency and steal substantial power. However, our approach required time to track new frequencies or precise adjustments of inductance and capacitance, which would be less effective against potential rapid transmitter frequency changes or capacitance drift. As a solution, we enhanced the interceptor and enabled it to intrude as well as steal energy within just three cycles of the high-frequency signal. Moreover, it can work without any circuit parameters or look-up tables. The key innovation is synchronizing the receiver current with the phase of the magnetic sensor voltage. Through MATLAB / Simulink simulations, finite-element analysis, and experimental validation, we demonstrated that our improved method can steal over 76% of the power received by a fully resonant receiver under identical conditions. This attack demonstrates that simple frequency-changing power encryption offers limited protection against such threats.</description>

      <title>Interpolatory Approximations of PMU Data: Dimension Reduction and Pilot Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the reduction of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data through low-rank matrix approximations. To reconstruct a PMU data matrix from fewer measurements, we propose the framework of interpolatory matrix decompositions (IDs). In contrast to methods relying on principal component analysis or singular value decomposition, IDs recover the complete data matrix using only a few of its rows (PMU datastreams) and/or a few of its columns (snapshots in time). This compression enables the real-time monitoring of power transmission systems using a limited number of measurements, thereby minimizing communication bandwidth. The ID perspective gives a rigorous error bound on the quality of the data compression. We propose selecting rows and columns used in an ID via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a greedy algorithm that aims to control the error bound. This bound leads to a computable estimate for the reconstruction error during online operations. A violation of this estimate suggests a change in the system's operating conditions, and thus serves as a tool for fault detection. Numerical tests using synthetic PMU data illustrate DEIM's excellent performance for data compression, and validate the proposed DEIM-based fault-detection method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna is a promising wireless communication technology that enhances communication rate by changing the antenna positions. This article proposes a new communication system that combines multiple-input single-output (MISO) fluid antennas with traditional fixed-position antennas, utilizing antenna position optimization to improve energy harvesting efficiency. In this model, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) which transmits identical signals from the base station to both information receiver (IR) and energy receiver (ER). We strive to enhance the power delivered to the ER by fine-tuning the positions of transmit and receive fluid antennas, along with optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a given minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the IR. Simulation results indicate that fluid antenna systems significantly enhance the energy harvesting efficiency of the ER compared to traditional fixed-position antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper, we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve the immersive spatial sound experience.

      <title>Bayesian Jammer Localization with a Hybrid CNN and Path-Loss Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming, particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.</description>

      <title>MIMO-Zak-OTFS with Superimposed Spread Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of spread pilot design and effective channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output Zak-OTFS (MIMO-Zak-OTFS) with superimposed spread pilots, where data and spread pilot signals are superimposed in the same frame. To achieve good estimation performance in a MIMO setting, the spread pilots at different transmit antennas need to be effectively separated at the receiver. Towards this, we propose a spread pilot design that separates the pilot sequences in the cross-ambiguity domain and enables the estimation of the effective channel taps by a simple read-off operation. To further alleviate the effect of pilot-data interference on performance, we carry out turbo iterations between channel estimation and detection. Simulation results for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ MIMO-Zak-OTFS with Gaussian-sinc pulse shaping filter for vehicular-A channel model show that the proposed pilot design and estimation scheme with three turbo iterations can achieve very good estimation/detection performance.</description>

      <title>Radar-Camera Fused Multi-Object Tracking: Online Calibration and Common Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

      <title>From High-SNR Radar Signal to ECG: A Transfer Learning Model with Cardio-Focusing Algorithm for Scenarios with Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are available after the publication.</description>

      <title>Posterior Cram\'er-Rao Bounds on Localization and Mapping Errors in Distributed MIMO SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-frequency simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods jointly infer the position of mobile transmitters and receivers in wireless networks, together with a geometric map of the propagation environment. An inferred map of specular surfaces can be used to exploit non-line-of-sight components of the multipath channel to increase robustness, bypass obstructions, and improve overall communication and positioning performance. While performance bounds for user location are well established, the literature lacks performance bounds for map information. This paper derives the mapping error bound (MEB), i.e., the posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound on the position and orientation of specular surfaces, for RF-SLAM. In particular, we consider a very general scenario with single- and double-bounce reflections, as well as distributed anchors. We demonstrate numerically that a state-of-the-art RF-SLAM algorithm asymptotically converges to this MEB. The bounds assess not only the localization (position and orientation) but also the mapping performance of RF-SLAM algorithms in terms of global features.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-Powered Electrical Brain Signals Analysis: Advancing Neurological Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurological disorders pose major global health challenges, driving advances in brain signal analysis. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are widely used for diagnosis and monitoring. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations hinder the development of robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. For each condition, we review representative methods and their quantitative results, integrating performance comparisons with analyses of data usage, model design, and task-specific adaptations, while highlighting the role of pre-trained multi-task models in achieving scalable, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a standardized benchmark to evaluate models across diverse datasets and improve reproducibility, emphasizing how recent innovations are transforming neurological diagnostics toward intelligent, adaptable healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>Nuisance parameters and elliptically symmetric distributions: a geometric approach to parametric and semiparametric efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elliptically symmetric distributions are a classic example of a semiparametric model where the location vector and the scatter matrix (or a parameterization of them) are the two finite-dimensional parameters of interest, while the density generator represents an \textit{infinite-dimensional nuisance} term. This basic representation of the elliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering additional \textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is therefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between statistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence of both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous works that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our approach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such as projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space. This allows us to obtain original results also for the case where the location vector and the scatter matrix are parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector that can be partitioned in two sub-vectors: one containing the parameters of interest and the other containing the nuisance parameters. As an example, we illustrate how the obtained results can be applied to the well-known \virg{low-rank} parameterization. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis will be developed for Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES) distributions, we show how to extend our results to the case of Circular and Non-Circular Complex Elliptically Symmetric (C-CES and NC-CES) distributions.</description>

      <title>Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators: Model Recovery in Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to similar representations across architectures, the representational properties of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.</description>
