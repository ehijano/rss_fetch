      <title>Fractal uncertainty principle for random Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the fractal uncertainty principle (FUP) for random fractal sets. In the prequel (arXiv:2107.08276), we considered the Cantor sets in the discrete setting with alphabets randomly chosen from a base of digits so the dimension d is in (0,2/3). We proved that, with overwhelming probability, the FUP with an exponent &gt;=1/2-3d/4- holds for these discrete Cantor sets with random alphabets.
  In this sequel, we construct random Cantor sets with dimension d in (0,2/3) in R via a different random procedure from the one in the prequel. We prove that, with overwhelming probability, the FUP with an exponent &gt;=1/2-3d/4- holds. The proof follows from establishing a Fourier decay estimate of the corresponding random Cantor measures, which is in turn based on a concentration of measure phenomenon in an appropriate probability space for the random Cantor sets.</description>

      <title>Fractional maximal operators on weighted variable Lebesgue spaces over the spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,d,\mu)$ is a space of homogeneous type, we establish a new class of fractional-type variable weights $A_{p(\cdot), q(\cdot)}(X)$. Then, we get the new weighted strong-type and weak-type characterizations for fractional maximal operators $M_\eta$ on weighted variable Lebesgue spaces over $(X,d,\mu)$. This study generalizes the results by Cruz-Uribe-Fiorenza-Neugebauer (2012), Bernardis-Dalmasso-Pradolini (2014), Cruz-Uribe-Shukla (2018), and Cruz-Uribe-Cummings (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the operator analogue of Laplace's method and the matrix form of Watson's lemma. The main approach utilised is that described by Williams and Wong [J. Approx. Theory 24 (4) (1974), 378--384]. Some examples are also given.</description>

      <title>A note on the maximal operator on Banach function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we answer positively to two conjectures proposed by Nieraeth (2023) about the maximal operator on rescaled Banach function spaces. We also obtain a new criterion saying when the maximal operator bounded on a Banach function space $X$ is also bounded on the associate space $X'$.</description>

      <title>Isomonodromy and Painlev\'e type equations, Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an abundance of equations of Painlev\'e type besides the classical Painlev\'e equations. Classifications have been computed by the Japanese school. Here we consider Painlev\'e type equations induced by isomonodromic families of linear ODE's having at most $z=0$ and $z=\infty$ as singularities. Requiring that the formal data at the singularities produce isomonodromic families parametrized by a single variable $t$ leads to a small list of hierarchies of cases. The study of these cases involves Stokes matrices and moduli for linear ODE's on the projective line.
  Case studies reveal interesting families of linear ODE's and Painlev\'e type equations. However, rather often the complexity (especially of the Lax pair) is too high for either the computations or for the output. Apart from classical Painlev\'e equations one rediscovers work of M.~Mazzocco, M.~Noumi and Y.~Yamada. A hierarchy, probably new, related to the classical $P_3(D_8)$, is discovered. Finally, an amusing ``companion'' of $P_1$ is presented.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1$.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation of compactness on Banach function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an extrapolation of compactness theorem for operators on Banach function spaces satisfying certain convexity and concavity conditions. In particular, we show that the boundedness of an operator $T$ in the weighted Lebesgue scale and the compactness of $T$ in the unweighted Lebesgue scale yields compactness of $T$ on a very general class of Banach function spaces. As our main new tool, we prove various characterizations of the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on such spaces and their associate spaces, using a novel sparse self-improvement technique. We apply our main results to prove compactness of the commutators of singular integral operators and pointwise multiplication by functions of vanishing mean oscillation on, for example, weighted variable Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Faber-Krahn inequalities, the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman formula, and Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$ conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06187v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to prove quantitative spectral inequalities for the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary conditions. More specifically, we prove sharp quantitative stability for the Faber-Krahn inequality in terms of Newtonian capacities and Hausdorff contents of positive codimension, thus providing an answer to a question posed by De Philippis and Brasco.
  One of our results asserts that for any bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\geq3$, with Lebesgue measure equal to that of the unit ball and whose first eigenvalue is $\lambda_\Omega$, denoting by $\lambda_B$ the first eigenvalue for the unit ball, for any $a\in (0,1)$ it holds $$\lambda_\Omega - \lambda_B \geq C(a) \,\inf_B \bigg(\sup_{t\in (0,1)} \frac1{H^{n-1}(\partial ((1-t) B))} \int_{\partial ((1-t) B)} \frac{\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}(B(x,atr_B)\setminus \Omega)}{(t\,r_B)^{n-3}}\,dH^{n-1}(x)\bigg)^2,$$ where the infimum is taken over all balls $B$ with the same Lebesgue measure as $\Omega$ and $\operatorname{Cap}_{n-2}$ is the Newtonian capacity of homogeneity $n-2$. In fact, this holds for bounded subdomains of the sphere and the hyperbolic space, as well.
  In a second result, we also apply the new Faber-Krahn type inequalities to quantify the Hayman-Friedland inequality about the characteristics of disjoint domains in the unit sphere. Thirdly, we propose a natural extension of Carleson's $\varepsilon^2$-conjecture to higher dimensions in terms of a square function involving the characteristics of certain spherical domains, and we prove the necessity of the finiteness of such square function in the tangent points via the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman monotonicity formula. Finally, we answer in the negative a question posed by Allen, Kriventsov and Neumayer in connection to rectifiability and the positivity set of the ACF monotonicity formula.</description>

      <title>On Abel's Problem about Logarithmic Integrals in Positive Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear differential equations with polynomial coefficients over a field $K$ of positive characteristic $p$ with local exponents in the prime field have a basis of solutions in the differential extension $\mathcal{R}_p=K(z_1, z_2, \ldots)(\!( x)\!)$ of $K(x)$, where $x'=1, z_1'=1/x$ and $z_i'=z_{i-1}'/z_{i-1}$. For differential equations of order $1$ it is shown that there exists a solution $y$ whose projections $y\vert_{z_{i+1}=z_{i+2}=\cdots=0}$ are algebraic over the field of rational functions $K(x, z_1, \ldots, z_{i})$ for all $i$. This can be seen as a characteristic $p$ analogue of Abel's problem about the algebraicity of logarithmic integrals. Further, the existence of infinite product representations of these solutions is shown. As a main tool $p^i$-curvatures are introduced, generalizing the notion of the $p$-curvature.</description>
