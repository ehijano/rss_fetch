      <title>On Long-Term Species Coexistence in Five-Species Evolutionary Spatial Cyclic Games with Ablated and Non-Ablated Dominance Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a replication and, to some extent, a refutation of key results published by Zhong, Zhang, Li, Dai, &amp; Yang in their 2022 paper "Species coexistence in spatial cyclic game of five species" (Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 156: 111806), where ecosystem species coexistence was explored via simulation studies of the evolutionary spatial cyclic game (ESCG) Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (RPSLS) with certain predator-prey relationships removed from the game's "interaction structure", i.e. with specific arcs ablated in the ESCG's dominance network, and with the ESCG run for 100,000 Monte Carlo Steps (MCS) to identify its asymptotic behaviors. I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic. Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow.</description>

      <title>Traveling vegetation-herbivore waves can sustain ecosystems threatened by droughts and population growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dryland vegetation can survive water stress by forming spatial patterns but is often subjected to herbivory as an additional stress that puts it at risk of desertification. Understanding the mutual relationships between vegetation patterning and herbivory is crucial for securing food production in drylands, which constitute the majority of rangelands worldwide. Here, we introduce a novel vegetation-herbivore model that captures pattern-forming feedbacks associated with water and herbivory stress and a behavioral aspect of herbivores representing an exploitation strategy.Applying numerical continuation methods, we analyze the bifurcation structure of uniform and patterned vegetation-herbivore solutions, and use direct numerical simulations to study various forms of collective herbivore dynamics. We find that herbivory stress can induce traveling vegetation-herbivore waves and uncover the ecological mechanism that drives their formation. In the traveling-wave state, the herbivore distribution is asymmetric with higher density on one side of each vegetation patch. At low precipitation values their distribution is localized, while at high precipitation the herbivores are spread over the entire landscape. Importantly, their asymmetric distribution results in uneven herbivory stress, strong on one side of each vegetation patch and weak on the opposing side - weaker than the stress exerted in spatially uniform herbivore distribution. Consequently, the formation of traveling waves results in increased sustainability to herbivory stress. We conclude that vegetation-herbivore traveling waves may play an essential role in sustaining herbivore populations under conditions of combined water and herbivory stress, thereby contributing to food security in endangered regions threatened by droughts and population growth.</description>

      <title>Adaptive efficiency of information processing in immune-pathogen co-evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organisms have evolved immune systems that can counter pathogenic threats. The adaptive immune system in vertebrates consists of a diverse repertoire of immune receptors that can dynamically reorganize to specifically target the ever-changing pathogenic landscape. Pathogens in return evolve to escape the immune challenge, forming an co-evolutionary arms race. We introduce a formalism to characterize out-of-equilibrium interactions in co-evolutionary processes. We show that the rates of information exchange and entropy production can distinguish the leader from the follower in an evolutionary arms races. Lastly, we introduce co-evolutionary efficiency as a metric to quantify each population's ability to exploit information in response to the other. Our formalism provides insights into the conditions necessary for stable co-evolution and establishes bounds on the limits of information exchange and adaptation in co-evolving systems.</description>

      <title>A Review of Artificial Intelligence based Biological-Tree Construction: Priorities, Methods, Applications and Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological tree analysis serves as a pivotal tool in uncovering the evolutionary and differentiation relationships among organisms, genes, and cells. Its applications span diverse fields including phylogenetics, developmental biology, ecology, and medicine. Traditional tree inference methods, while foundational in early studies, face increasing limitations in processing the large-scale, complex datasets generated by modern high-throughput technologies. Recent advances in deep learning offer promising solutions, providing enhanced data processing and pattern recognition capabilities. However, challenges remain, particularly in accurately representing the inherently discrete and non-Euclidean nature of biological trees. In this review, we first outline the key biological priors fundamental to phylogenetic and differentiation tree analyses, facilitating a deeper interdisciplinary understanding between deep learning researchers and biologists. We then systematically examine the commonly used data formats and databases, serving as a comprehensive resource for model testing and development. We provide a critical analysis of traditional tree generation methods, exploring their underlying biological assumptions, technical characteristics, and limitations. Current developments in deep learning-based tree generation are reviewed, highlighting both recent advancements and existing challenges. Furthermore, we discuss the diverse applications of biological trees across various biological domains. Finally, we propose potential future directions and trends in leveraging deep learning for biological tree research, aiming to guide further exploration and innovation in this field.</description>

      <title>A branch-&amp;-price approach to the unrooted maximum agreement forest problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first branch-&amp;-price algorithm for the maximum agreement forest problem on unrooted binary trees: given two unrooted X-labelled binary trees we seek to partition X into a minimum number of blocks such that the induced subtrees are disjoint and have the same topologies in both trees. We provide a dynamic programming algorithm for the weighted maximum agreement subtree problem to solve the pricing problem. When combined with rigorous polynomial-time pre-processing our branch-&amp;-price algorithm exhibits (beyond) state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Two-Tier Mathematical Transmission Model to Explore Virulence Evolution in Vector-Borne Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence or adaptation of pathogens may lead to epidemics or even pandemics, highlighting the need for a thorough understanding of pathogen evolution. The tradeoff hypothesis suggests that virulence evolves to reach an optimal transmission intensity relative to the mortality caused by the disease. This study introduces a mathematical model that incorporates key factors such as recovery times and mortality rates, focusing on the diminishing effects of parasite growth on transmission, with a focus on vector-borne diseases. The analysis reveals conditions under which heightened virulence occurs in hosts, indicating that these factors can support vector-host transmission of a pathogen, even if the host-only component is insufficient for sustainable transmission. This insight helps explain the significant presence of pathogens with high fatality rates, such as those in vector-borne diseases. The findings underscore an elevated risk for future outbreaks involving vector-borne diseases. Enhanced surveillance of mortality rates and techniques to monitor pathogen evolution are vital to effectively control future epidemics. This study provides essential insights for epidemic preparedness and highlights the need for ongoing research into pathogen evolution.</description>

      <title>Multiple merger coalescent inference of effective population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variation in a sample of molecular sequence data informs about the past evolutionary history of the sample's population. Traditionally, Bayesian modeling coupled with the standard coalescent, is used to infer the sample's bifurcating genealogy and demographic and evolutionary parameters such as effective population size, and mutation rates. However, there are many situations where binary coalescent models do not accurately reflect the true underlying ancestral processes. Here, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric method for inferring effective population size trajectories from a multifurcating genealogy under the $\Lambda-$coalescent. In particular, we jointly estimate the effective population size and model parameters for the Beta-coalescent model, a special type of $\Lambda-$coalescent. Finally, we test our methods on simulations and apply them to study various viral dynamics as well as Japanese sardine population size changes over time. The code and vignettes can be found in the phylodyn package.</description>
