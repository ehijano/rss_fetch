      <title>Divergent geodesics, ambiguous closed geodesics and the binary additive divisor problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an asymptotic formula as $t\to+\infty$ for the number of common perpendiculars of length at most $t$ between two divergent geodesics or a divergent geodesic and a compact locally convex subset in negatively curved locally symmetric spaces with exponentially mixing geodesic flow, presenting a surprising non-purely exponential growth. We apply this result to count ambiguous geodesics in the modular orbifold recovering results of Sarnak, and to confirm and extend a conjecture of Motohashi on the binary additive divisor problem in imaginary quadratic number fields.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider harmonic maps from closed, two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds into a closed, Riemannian target manifold of dimension two or higher. We develop a gluing theory for such harmonic maps. In addtion, we develop the properties of this gluing map and apply them to the phenomenon of energy bubbling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present alternative proofs for two known rigidity results concerning non-negatively curved compact biconservative hypersurfaces in space forms. Further, we prove some new rigidity results by replacing the hypothesis of non-negative sectional curvature with some estimates of the squared norm of the shape operator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the trajectories of unreduced $\phi$-simple Chaplygin kinetic systems are reparametrizations of horizontal geodesics with respect to a modified Riemannian metric. Furthermore, our proof is constructive and these Riemannian metrics, which are not unique, are obtained explicitly in interesting examples. We also extend these results to $\phi$-simple Chaplygin mechanical systems (not necessarily kinetic).</description>

      <title>On the flows of linear fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note provides a detailed proof of the fact that a linear vector field on a vector bundle has a flow by vector bundle isomorphisms. It implies then easily the existence of global solutions to linear non-autonomous ODE's, with a standard time-dependent flow construction. As a further application, a simple proof of the smooth triviality of vector bundles over contractible bases is given. Finally, a detailed elementary proof of the isomorphy (as Lie algebras) of all fibers of the kernel of a transitive Lie algebroid is given.</description>

      <title>From Clifford Bundles to Spinor Classification: Algebraic and Geometric Approaches, and New Spinor Classes in Flux Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By bridging geometric and algebraic concepts, this dissertation lays the groundwork for a comprehensive study of the Clifford structures on bundles and spinor fields. We delve into the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle, which encapsulates the essence of Clifford algebras and provides profound insights into the algebraic structures underlying geometric frameworks. The algebraic and classical definitions of spinors within Clifford algebras are concerned, as well as their global realisation as sections of the bundle of spinors constructed within a spin structure on a manifold from the K\"ahler-Atiyah bundle background which serves as an effective framework for applications involving spinors such as their classification based on their bilinear covariants and Fierz identities. Homogeneous differential forms playing the role of bilinear covariants can vanish due to algebraic obstructions in a warped flux compactification AdS$_3 \times M_8$ yielding the identification of new spinor field classes.</description>

      <title>Rigidity in the Lorentzian Calder\'on problem with formally determined data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Lorentzian Calder\'on problem, where the objective is to determine a globally hyperbolic Lorentzian metric up to a boundary fixing diffeomorphism from boundary measurements given by the hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. This problem is a wave equation analogue of the Calder\'on problem on Riemannian manifolds. We prove that if a globally hyperbolic metric agrees with the Minkowski metric outside a compact set and has the same hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann map as the Minkowski metric, then it must be the Minkowski metric up to diffeomorphism. In fact we prove the same result with a much smaller amount of measurements, thus solving a formally determined inverse problem. To prove these results we introduce a new method for geometric hyperbolic inverse problems. The method is based on distorted plane wave solutions and on a combination of geometric, topological and unique continuation arguments.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz inextendibility of weak null singularities from curvature blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility of weak null singularities without any symmetry assumptions. The proof introduces a new strategy to infer $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-inextendibility from the blow-up of curvature. The assumed blow-up is expected to be satisfied for weak null singularities in the interior of generic rotating black holes. Thus, we expect the result presented here to directly contribute to the resolution of the $C^{0,1}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-formulation of the strong cosmic censorship conjecture in a neighbourhood of subextremal Kerr.</description>

      <title>An index bound for smooth umbilic points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5994</link>
      <description>arXiv:1207.5994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the half-integer valued local index of an isolated umbilic point on a $C^{3+\alpha}$-smooth convex surface in Euclidean 3-space is less than two. The approach is to study the co-kernel of an associated Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem.
  The link between the local and global is a semi-local technique that we term totally real blow-up. Topologically, given a real surface in a complex surface, the totally real blow-up is the connect sum of the real surface with an embedded real projective plane. We show that this increases the sum of the complex indices of the real surface by one, and hence cancels isolated hyperbolic complex points.
  This leads to the reduction of the local result to the global result (the non-existence of closed embedded Lagrangian surfaces with a single complex point), proving that the umbilic index for smooth surfaces is less than two. Comparison of our smooth result with that of Hans Hamburger in the real analytic case (stating that the index of an isolated umbilic point on a real analytic convex surface is less than or equal to one) suggests the existence of "exotic" umbilic points of index 3/2.</description>

      <title>Foliations of asymptotically flat 3-manifolds by stable constant mean curvature spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be an asymptotically flat Riemannian manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$ with positive mass. We give a short proof based on Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction of the existence of an asymptotic foliation of $(M, g)$ by stable constant mean curvature spheres. Moreover, we show that the geometric center of mass of the foliation agrees with the Hamiltonian center of mass of $(M,g)$. In dimension $n = 3$, these results were shown previously by C. Nerz using a different approach. In the case where $n=3$ and the scalar curvature of $(M, g)$ is nonnegative, we prove that the leaves of the asymptotic foliation are the only large stable constant mean curvature spheres that enclose the center of $(M, g)$. This was shown previously under more restrictive decay assumptions and using a different method by S. Ma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that there exists a compact perturbation of the Ricci flat Taub-Bolt metric that evolves under the Ricci flow into a finite time singularity modelled on the shrinking solition FIK [5]. Moreover, this perturbation can be made arbitrarily L^2-small with respect to the Taub-Bolt metric. The method of proof closely follows the strategy adopted in [14], where the author constructs, via a Wa\.zewski box argument, Ricci flows on compact manifolds which encounter finite singularities modelled on a given asymptotically conical shrinking soliton.</description>

      <title>Linear Chern-Hopf-Thurston conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is a closed $2n$-dimensional aspherical manifold, i.e., the universal cover of $X$ is contractible, then the Chern-Hopf-Thurston conjecture predicts that $(-1)^n\chi(X)\geq 0$. We prove this conjecture when $X$ is a complex projective manifold whose fundamental group admits an almost faithful linear representation over any field. In fact, we prove a much stronger statement that if $X$ is a complex projective manifold with large fundamental group and $\pi_1(X)$ admits an almost faithful linear representation, then $\chi(X, \mathcal{P})\geq 0$ for any perverse sheaf $\mathcal{P}$ on $X$.
  To prove this, we introduce a vanishing cycle functor of multivalued one-forms and apply techniques from non-abelian Hodge theory, both in archimedean and non-archimedean settings. These techniques allow us to deduce the desired positivity from the geometric properties of pure and mixed period maps.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis on principal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact Lie group. We introduce a semiclassical framework, called Borel-Weil calculus, to investigate $G$-equivariant (pseudo)differential operators acting on $G$-principal bundles over closed manifolds. In this calculus, the semiclassical parameters correspond to the highest roots in the Weyl chamber of the group $G$ that parametrize irreducible representations, and operators are pseudodifferential in the base variable, with values in Toeplitz operators on the flag manifold associated to the group. This monograph unfolds two main applications of our calculus.
  Firstly, in the realm of dynamical systems, we obtain explicit sufficient conditions for rapid mixing of volume-preserving partially hyperbolic flows obtained as extensions of an Anosov flow to a $G$-principal bundle (for an arbitrary $G$). In particular, when $G = \mathrm{U}(1)$, we prove that the flow on the extension is rapid mixing whenever the Anosov flow is not jointly integrable, and the circle bundle is not torsion. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that ergodicity of the extension is equivalent to rapid mixing. Secondly, we study the spectral theory of sub-elliptic Laplacians obtained as horizontal Laplacians of a $G$-equivariant connection on a principal bundle. When $G$ is semisimple, we prove that the horizontal Laplacian is globally hypoelliptic as soon as the connection has a dense holonomy group in $G$. Notably, this result encompasses all flat bundles with a dense monodromy group in $G$. We also prove a quantum ergodicity result for flat (and in some situations non-flat) principal bundles under a suitable ergodicity assumption.
  We believe that this monograph will serve as a cornerstone for future investigations applying the Borel-Weil calculus across different fields.</description>
