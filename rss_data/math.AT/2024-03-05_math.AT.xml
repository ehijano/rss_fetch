      <title>Equivariant cohomology for cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the $RO(C_n)$-graded coefficient ring of equivariant cohomology for cyclic groups $C_n$, in the case of Burnside ring coefficients, and in the case of constant coefficients. We use the invertible Mackey functors under the box product to reduce the gradings in the computation from $RO(C_n)$ to those expressable as combinations of $\lambda^d$ for divisors $d$ of $n$, where $\lambda$ is the inclusion of $C_n$ in $S^1$ as the roots of unity. We make explicit computations for the geometric fixed points for Burnside ring coefficients, and in the positive cone for constant coefficients. The positive cone is also computed for the Burnside ring in the case of prime power order, and in the case of square free order. Finally, we also make computations at non-negative gradings for the constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Distributed Persistent Homology for 2D Alpha Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm to parallelise the computation of persistent homology of 2D alpha complexes. Our algorithm distributes the input point cloud among the cores which then compute a cover based on a rectilinear grid. We show how to compute the persistence Mayer-Vietoris spectral sequence from these covers and how to obtain persistent homology from it. For this, we introduce second-page collapse conditions and explain how to solve the extension problem. Finally, we give an overview of an implementation in C++ using Open MPI and discuss some experimental results.</description>

      <title>Manifolds realized as orbit spaces of non-free $\mathbb Z_2^k$-actions on real moment-angle manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider (non-necessarily free) actions of subgroups $H\subset \mathbb Z_2^m$ on the real moment-angle manifold $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P$ corresponding to a simple convex $n$ polytope $P$ with $m$ facets. The criterion when the orbit space $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a topological manifold (perhaps with a boundary) can be extracted from results by M.A. Mikhailova and C. Lange. For any dimension $n$ we construct series of manifolds $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ homeomorphic to $S^n$ and series of manifolds $M^n=\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ admitting a hyperelliptic involution $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$, that is an involution $\tau$ such that $M^n/\langle\tau\rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^n$. For any $3$-polytope $P$ we classify all subgroups $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ such that $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$ is a $3$-sphere or a rational homology $3$-sphere. For any $3$-polytope $P$ and any subgroup $H\subset\mathbb Z_2^m$ we classify all hyperelliptic involutions $\tau\in\mathbb Z_2^m/H$ acting on $\mathbb R\mathcal{Z}_P/H$. As a corollary we obtain that a $3$-dimensional small cover has $3$ hyperelliptic involutions in $\mathbb Z_2^3$ if and only if it is a rational homology $3$-sphere and if and only if it correspond to a triple of Hamiltonian cycles such that each edge of the polytope belongs to exactly two of them.</description>

      <title>Transchromatic phenomena in the equivariant slice spectral sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a transchromatic phenomenon for Hill--Hopkins--Ravenel and Lubin--Tate theories. This establishes a direct relationship between the equivariant slice spectral sequences of height-$h$ and height-$(h/2)$ theories. As applications of this transchromatic phenomenon, we prove periodicity and vanishing line results for these theories.</description>

      <title>A proof of Bott periodicity via Quot schemes and bulk-edge correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give alternative proofs of Bott periodicity of $ K $-theory and the bulk-edge correspondence of integer quantum Hall effect. Regarding Bott periodicity, we connect its proof with configuration spaces and use Quot schemes in algebraic geometry in our proof. Regarding the bulk-edge correspondence, we formulate edge indices based on the consideration of Graf--Porta and give a more elementary and self-contained proof.</description>

      <title>Generation time for biexact functors and Koszul objects in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the generation time that measures the number of cones necessary to obtain an object in a triangulated category from another object. This invariant is called level. We establish level inequalities for enhanced triangulated categories: One inequality concerns biexact functors of topological triangulated categories, another Koszul objects. In particular, this extends inequalities for the derived tensor product from commutative algebra to enhanced tensor triangulated categories. We include many examples.</description>

      <title>Pull-back Geometry of Persistent Homology Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) is a method for generating topology-inspired representations of data. Empirical studies that investigate the properties of PH, such as its sensitivity to perturbations or ability to detect a feature of interest, commonly rely on training and testing an additional model on the basis of the PH representation. To gain more intrinsic insights about PH, independently of the choice of such a model, we propose a novel methodology based on the pull-back geometry that a PH encoding induces on the data manifold. The spectrum and eigenvectors of the induced metric help to identify the most and least significant information captured by PH. Furthermore, the pull-back norm of tangent vectors provides insights about the sensitivity of PH to a given perturbation, or its potential to detect a given feature of interest, and in turn its ability to solve a given classification or regression problem. Experimentally, the insights gained through our methodology align well with the existing knowledge about PH. Moreover, we show that the pull-back norm correlates with the performance on downstream tasks, and can therefore guide the choice of a suitable PH encoding.</description>

      <title>Reformulation of the stable Adams conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit methods of proof of the Adams Conjecture in order to correct and supplement earlier efforts to prove analogous conjectures in the stable homotopy category. We utilize simplicial schemes over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and a rigid version of Artin-Mazur \'etale homotopy theory. Consideration of special $\mathcal F$-spaces and together with Bousfield-Kan $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completion enables us to employ an "\'etale functor" which commutes up to homotopy with products of simplicial schemes. In order to prove the Stable Adams Conjecture, we construct the universal $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibrations for various pointed simplicial sets $X$. Thus, two maps from a given $\mathcal F$-space $\underline{\mathcal B}$ to the base $\mathcal F$-space of the universal $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibration $\pi_{X,\ell}: \underline {\mathcal B} (G_\ell(X),X_\ell) \to \underline {\mathcal B} G_\ell(X)$ determine homotopy equivalent maps of spectra if and only they correspond via pull-back of $\pi_{X,\ell}$ to fiber homotopy equivalent $\mathbb Z/\ell$-completed $X$-fibrations over $\underline {\mathcal B}$. For the proof of the Stable Adams Conjecture, we consider maps of $\mathcal F$-spaces $\underline {\mathcal B }\to \underline {\mathcal B} G_\ell(S^2)$ where $\underline {\mathcal B}$ is an $\mathcal F$-space model of connective $\ell$-completed connective $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>On the $\infty$-topos semantics of homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many introductions to homotopy type theory and the univalence axiom gloss over the semantics of this new formal system in traditional set-based foundations. This expository article, written as lecture notes to accompany a 3-part mini course delivered at the Logic and Higher Structures workshop at CIRM-Luminy, attempts to survey the state of the art, first presenting Voevodsky's simplicial model of univalent foundations and then touring Shulman's vast generalization, which provides an interpretation of homotopy type theory with strict univalent universes in any $\infty$-topos. As we will explain, this achievement was the product of a community effort to abstract and streamline the original arguments as well as develop new lines of reasoning.</description>

      <title>Homological stability for generalized Hurwitz spaces and Selmer groups in quadratic twist families over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a version of the Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains heuristics for Selmer groups of quadratic twist families of abelian varieties over global function fields. As a consequence, we derive a result towards the "minimalist conjecture" on Selmer ranks of abelian varieties in such families. More precisely, we show that the probabilities predicted in these two conjectures are correct to within an error term in the size of the constant field, $q$, which goes to $0$ as $q$ grows. Two key inputs are a new homological stability theorem for a generalized version of Hurwitz spaces parameterizing covers of punctured Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus, and an expression of average sizes of Selmer groups in terms of the number of rational points on these Hurwitz spaces over finite fields.</description>
