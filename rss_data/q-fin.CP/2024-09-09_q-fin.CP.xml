      <title>Semi-analytical pricing of options written on SOFR futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a semi-analytical approach to pricing options on SOFR futures where the underlying SOFR follows a time-dependent CEV model. By definition, these options change their type at the beginning of the reference period: before this time, this is an American option written on a SOFR forward price as an underlying, and after this point, this is an arithmetic Asian option with an American style exercise written on the daily SOFR rates. We develop a new version of the GIT method and solve both problems semi-analytically, obtaining the option price, the exercise boundary, and the option Greeks. This work is intended to address the concern that the transfer from LIBOR to SOFR has resulted in a situation in which the options of the key money market (i.e., futures on the reference rate) are options without any pricing model available. Therefore, the trading in options on 3M SOFR futures currently ends before their reference quarter starts, to eliminate the final metamorphosis into exotic options.</description>

      <title>QuantFactor REINFORCE: Mining Steady Formulaic Alpha Factors with Variance-bounded REINFORCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of alpha factor mining is to discover indicative signals of investment opportunities from the historical financial market data of assets. Deep learning based alpha factor mining methods have shown to be powerful, which, however, lack of the interpretability, making them unacceptable in the risk-sensitive real markets. Alpha factors in formulaic forms are more interpretable and therefore favored by market participants, while the search space is complex and powerful explorative methods are urged. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining, making it ineffective to explore the search space of the formula. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. Given that the underlying state transition function adheres to the Dirac distribution, the Markov Decision Process within this framework exhibit minimal environmental variability, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Experimental evaluations on various real assets data show that the proposed algorithm can increase the correlation with asset returns by 3.83%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.</description>

      <title>DEPLOYERS: An agent based modeling tool for multi country real world data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recent progress in the design and development of DEPLOYERS, an agent-based macroeconomics modeling (ABM) framework, capable to deploy and simulate a full economic system (individual workers, goods and services firms, government, central and private banks, financial market, external sectors) whose structure and activity analysis reproduce the desired calibration data, that can be, for example a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) or a Supply-Use Table (SUT) or an Input-Output Table (IOT).Here we extend our previous work to a multi-country version and show an example using data from a 46-countries 64-sectors FIGARO Inter-Country IOT. The simulation of each country runs on a separate thread or CPU core to simulate the activity of one step (month, week, or day) and then interacts (updates imports, exports, transfer) with that country's foreign partners, and proceeds to the next step. This interaction can be chosen to be aggregated (a single row and column IO account) or disaggregated (64 rows and columns) with each partner. A typical run simulates thousands of individuals and firms engaged in their monthly activity and then records the results, much like a survey of the country's economic system. This data can then be subjected to, for example, an Input-Output analysis to find out the sources of observed stylized effects as a function of time in the detailed and realistic modeling environment that can be easily implemented in an ABM framework.</description>

      <title>MANA-Net: Mitigating Aggregated Sentiment Homogenization with News Weighting for Enhanced Market Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that extracting market sentiments from news data benefits market predictions. However, existing methods of using financial sentiments remain simplistic, relying on equal-weight and static aggregation to manage sentiments from multiple news items. This leads to a critical issue termed ``Aggregated Sentiment Homogenization'', which has been explored through our analysis of a large financial news dataset from industry practice. This phenomenon occurs when aggregating numerous sentiments, causing representations to converge towards the mean values of sentiment distributions and thereby smoothing out unique and important information. Consequently, the aggregated sentiment representations lose much predictive value of news data. To address this problem, we introduce the Market Attention-weighted News Aggregation Network (MANA-Net), a novel method that leverages a dynamic market-news attention mechanism to aggregate news sentiments for market prediction. MANA-Net learns the relevance of news sentiments to price changes and assigns varying weights to individual news items. By integrating the news aggregation step into the networks for market prediction, MANA-Net allows for trainable sentiment representations that are optimized directly for prediction. We evaluate MANA-Net using the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indices, along with financial news spanning from 2003 to 2018. Experimental results demonstrate that MANA-Net outperforms various recent market prediction methods, enhancing Profit &amp; Loss by 1.1% and the daily Sharpe ratio by 0.252.</description>

      <title>Advancing Financial Forecasting: A Comparative Analysis of Neural Forecasting Models N-HiTS and N-BEATS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of financial forecasting, the application of neural networks presents a compelling advancement over traditional statistical models. This research paper explores the effectiveness of two specific neural forecasting models, N-HiTS and N-BEATS, in predicting financial market trends. Through a systematic comparison with conventional models, this study demonstrates the superior predictive capabilities of neural approaches, particularly in handling the non-linear dynamics and complex patterns inherent in financial time series data. The results indicate that N-HiTS and N-BEATS not only enhance the accuracy of forecasts but also boost the robustness and adaptability of financial predictions, offering substantial advantages in environments that require real-time decision-making. The paper concludes with insights into the practical implications of neural forecasting in financial markets and recommendations for future research directions.</description>

      <title>Signature of maturity in cryptocurrency volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations, particularly the inequality of fluctuations, in cryptocurrency prices over the last ten years. We calculate the inequality in the price fluctuations through different measures, such as the Gini and Kolkata indices, and also the $Q$ factor (given by the ratio between the highest value and the average value) of these fluctuations. We compare the results with the equivalent quantities in some of the more prominent national currencies and see that while the fluctuations (or inequalities in such fluctuations) for cryptocurrencies were initially significantly higher than national currencies, over time the fluctuation levels of cryptocurrencies tend towards the levels characteristic of national currencies. We also compare similar quantities for a few prominent stock prices.</description>
