      <title>Graphs are maximally expressive for higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that graph-based models are fully capable of representing higher-order interactions, and have a long history of being used for precisely this purpose. This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on "higher-order networks" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to "pairwise" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Wisdom of the Crowd: How Network Topology Distorts Collective Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive biases are often attributed to heuristics or limited information. Yet the structure of social networks is a key, often-overlooked source of perceptual bias. When information passes through social connections, the network alone can systematically distort how individuals view society. We use a simple model in which agents have a binary attribute (e.g., atheist or believer) and show that network topology alone can cause misperceptions of peers' attributes. These misperceptions persist even after aggregation and challenge the idea of the "wisdom of the crowd." We derive an estimator that predicts the size and direction of these biases from network features. We validate our findings using three large-scale opinion surveys. Our results show that network structure is a critical factor in collective perception, with major implications for reducing segregation, polarisation, and the marginalisation of minorities.</description>

      <title>On the Concept of Violence: A Comparative Study of Human and AI Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: What counts as violence is neither self-evident nor universally agreed upon. While physical aggression is prototypical, contemporary societies increasingly debate whether exclusion, humiliation, online harassment or symbolic acts should be classified within the same moral category. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) are being consulted in everyday contexts to interpret and label complex social behaviors. Whether these systems reproduce, reshape or simplify human conceptions of violence remains an open question. Methods: Here we present a systematic comparison between human judgements and LLM classifications across 22 scenarios carefully designed to be morally dividing, spanning from physical and verbally aggressive behavior, relational dynamics, marginalization, symbolic actions and verbal expressions. Human responses were compared with outputs from multiple instruction-tuned models of varying sizes and architectures. We conducted global, sentence-level and thematic-domain analyses, and examined variability across models to assess patterns of convergence and divergence. Findings: This study treats violence as a strategically chosen proxy through which broader belief formation dynamics can be observed. Violence is not the focus of the study, but it serves as a tool to investigate broader analysis. It enables a structured investigation of how LLMs operationalize ambiguous moral constructs, negotiate conceptual boundaries, and transform plural human interpretations into singular outputs. More broadly, the findings contribute to ongoing debates about the epistemic role of conversational AI in shaping everyday interpretations of harm, responsibility and social norms, highlighting the importance of transparency and critical engagement as these systems increasingly mediate public reasoning.</description>

      <title>Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions Reshape Network Immunization Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herd immunity is shaped not only by the infection capacity of a spreading epidemic or the contact structure of the hosting population, but also by how and under what circumstances individuals acquire immunity. Immunization strategies may interact with ongoing non-pharmaceutical interventions, which commonly aim to reduce social contact numbers. We demonstrate that these interactions can induce unexpectedly strong and counterintuitive effects on herd immunity. We explore these phenomena on spatially embedded contact networks and uncover a reversal in the relative effectiveness of disease- versus vaccine-induced immunization schemes, highlighting the average number of contacts as a critical determinant of emerging herd immunity. In sparse geometric networks with limited degree heterogeneity, uniform vaccination proves most effective; however, as average contact numbers increase, naturally acquired immunity ultimately becomes the better strategy. We show that this phenomenon may emerge not only in synthetic networks but also in real-world mixing networks, observed during non-pharmaceutical intervention periods across multiple states of the United States.</description>
