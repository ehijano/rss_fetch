      <title>Lecture notes: From Gaussian processes to feature learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes develop the theory of learning in deep and recurrent neuronal networks from the point of view of Bayesian inference. The aim is to enable the reader to understand typical computations found in the literature in this field. Initial chapters develop the theoretical tools, such as probabilities, moment and cumulant-generating functions, and some notions of large deviation theory, as far as they are needed to understand collective network behavior with large numbers of parameters. The main part of the notes derives the theory of Bayesian inference for deep and recurrent networks, starting with the neural network Gaussian process (lazy-learning) limit, which is subsequently extended to study feature learning from the point of view of adaptive kernels. The notes also expose the link between the adaptive kernel approach and approaches of kernel rescaling.</description>

      <title>Michel Talagrand and the Rigorous Theory of Mean Field Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Michel Talagrand played a decisive role in the transformation of mean field spin glass theory into a rigorous mathematical subject. This chapter offers a narrative account of that development. We begin with the physical origins of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and the emergence of the TAP and Almeida-Thouless stability frameworks, culminating in Parisi's replica symmetry breaking (RSB) ansatz and its hierarchical order parameter. We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula. Throughout, we indicate how related contributions by many authors fit into the same long-running program across probability, analysis, and mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Glass-Structure Descriptors for Assessing the Intrinsic Reactivity of Mixed Amorphous-Crystalline Precursors in Alkali-Activated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable assessment of the intrinsic reactivity of amorphous aluminosilicates is critical for their application in alkali-activated materials (AAMs) and blended cements. Although physics-informed glass-structure descriptors have demonstrated strong structure-reactivity relationships for predominantly amorphous systems, their extension to heterogeneous precursors with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases has been limited. Here, quantitative X-ray diffraction combined with bulk compositional analysis was used to reconstruct the effective amorphous compositions of five fly ashes (FAs) and three ground granulated blast-furnace slags (GGBSs). These compositions served as inputs for molecular dynamics simulations employing a melt-and-quench approach to generate atomic-scale structural models of the glassy phases. Based on these structures, the previously introduced descriptors, i.e., average metal oxygen dissociation energy and average metal oxygen bond strength, were refined to cover a broader compositional space spanning SiO2-Al2O3-TiO2-Fe2O3-CaO-MgO-MnO-Na2O-K2O. The refined descriptors exhibit strong inverse correlations with multiple independent reactivity indicators, including cumulative heat release from isothermal calorimetry, bound water content from thermogravimetric analysis, and compressive strength, for both single precursors and binary FA-GGBS blends activated with NaOH. These results demonstrate that physics-informed glass-structure descriptors can be extended from ideal amorphous systems to heterogeneous mixed-phase precursors and capture relative intrinsic reactivity trends in alkaline solutions. The proposed framework provides a transferable, structure-informed basis for comparative assessment of precursor reactivity that complements experimental testing and may inform precursor screening and mix designs for AAM and blended cement systems.</description>

      <title>Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.</description>

      <title>Structure of solutions to continuous constraint satisfaction problems through the statistics of wedged and inscribed spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of random landscapes has long relied on counting stationary points: metastable states and the barriers between them. However, this method is useless for describing flat regions, common in constraint satisfaction problems. We introduce a characterization of flat regions by counting the number of spheres that can be uniquely inserted into them, either by wedging spheres of fixed radius or by inscribing spheres of variable radius. The ratio of these counts constrains the topology of the solution space. We apply this characterization to the spherical perceptron and show the existence of at least two topological regimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy as a probe of topological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy (EE) provides a powerful probe of quantum phases, yet its role in identifying topological phase transitions in disordered systems remains underexplored. We introduce an exact EE-based framework that captures topological phase transitions even in the presence of disorder. Specifically, for a class of Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model variants, we show that the difference in EE between half-filled and near-half-filled ground states, $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$, vanishes in the topological phase but remains finite in the trivial phase, a direct consequence of edge-state localization. This behavior persists even in the presence of quasiperiodic or binary disorder. By analyzing domain-wall configurations in the SSH chain, we further show how subsystem tuning allows one to distinguish genuine topological zero-energy eigenstates from trivial localized states. Exact phase boundaries, derived from Lyapunov exponents via transfer matrices, agree closely with numerical results from $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ and the topological invariant $\mathcal{Q}$, with instances where $\Delta S^{\mathcal{A}}$ outperforms $\mathcal{Q}$. Our results highlight EE as a robust diagnostic tool and a potential bridge between quantum information and condensed matter approaches to topological matter.</description>
