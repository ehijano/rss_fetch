      <title>Discrete Linear Canonical Transform on Graphs: Uncertainty Principles and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an increasing influx of classical signal processing methodologies into the field of graph signal processing, approaches grounded in discrete linear canonical transform have found application in graph signals. In this paper, we initially propose the uncertainty principle of the graph linear canonical transform (GLCT), which is based on a class of graph signals maximally concentrated in both vertex and graph spectral domains. Subsequently, leveraging the uncertainty principle, we establish conditions for recovering bandlimited signals of the GLCT from a subset of samples, thereby formulating the sampling theory for the GLCT. We elucidate interesting connections between the uncertainty principle and sampling. Further, by employing sampling set selection and experimental design sampling strategies, we introduce optimal sampling operators in the GLCT domain. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our methods through simulations and numerical experiments across applications.</description>

      <title>$\,_{3}F_{4}$ hypergeometric functions as a sum of a product of $\,_{2}F_{3}$ functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that certain $\,_{3}F_{4}$ hypergeometric functions may be expanded in sums of pair products of $\,_{2}F_{3}$ functions. This expands the class of hypergeometric functions having summation theorems beyond those expressible as pair-products of generalized Whittaker functions, $\,_{2}F_{1}$ functions, and $\,_{3}F_{2}$ functions into the realm of $\,_{P}F_{Q}$ functions where $P&lt;Q$ for both the summand and terms in the series. In addition to its intrinsic value, this result has a specific application in calculating the response of the atoms to laser stimulation in the Strong Field Approximation.</description>

      <title>On Godel's treatment of the undecidable in 1931</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the proof in the short unpublished paper appeared in the 3rd volume of Godel's Collected Works entitled "On undecidable sentences" (*1931?), which provides an introduction to Godel's 1931 ideas regarding the incompleteness of arithmetic. We analyze the meaning of the negation of the provability predicate, and how it is meant not to lead to vicious circle. We show how in fact in Godel's entire argument there is an omission regarding the cases of non-provability, which, once taken into consideration again, allow a completely different view of Godel's entire argument of incompleteness. Previous results of the author are applied to show that the definition of a contradiction is included in the argument of *1931?. Furthermore, an examination of the application of substitution in the well-known Godel formula as a violation of uniqueness is also briefly presented, questioning its very derivation.</description>

      <title>Rotational hypersufaces in $E^4_1$ with generalized $L_k$ 1-type Gauss map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Gauss map of rotational hypersurfaces in 4-dimensional Lorentz-Minkowski space concerning the linear second order differential operators $L_1$ and $L_2$, where $L_1$ is usually called as the Cheng-Yau operator. We obtain some classifications of rotational hypersurfaces which have $L_k$-harmonic Gauss map, $L_k$-pointwise 1-type Gauss map and generalized $L_k$ 1-type Gauss map, where $k = 1,2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides several theorems regarding the existence of limit for multivariable function, among which Theorem 1 and Theorem 3 relax the requirement for sequence of Heine's definition of limit. These results address the question of which paths need to be considered to determine the existence of limit for multivariable function.</description>

      <title>Quantum Properties of Mathematical Physics Equations. Generation of Quantum Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown with the help of skew-symmetric forms that the mathematical physics equations, on which no additional conditions are imposed, have quantum properties. And this is due to the integrability properties of differential equations, which depends on the consistency of derivatives with respect to different variables and the consistency of equations, if the mathematical physics equations are a system of equations. It was found that such equations on the original tangent space turn out to be non-integrable. Their derivatives do not form a differential. The integrability of such equations is realized only on the structures of a cotangent integrable manifold. This happens using a degenerate, non-differential-preserving transformation that has quantum properties. When implementing degenerate transformations, mini structures (quanta) arise, from which integrable structures are formed. Such properties of integrability of mathematical physics equations and features of degenerate transformations reveal the quantum properties of mathematical physics equations and their ability to generate quantum structures.</description>

      <title>Bent functions construction using extended Maiorana-McFarland's class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a particular case, we consider the extended Maiorana-McFarland class to obtain bent functions with balance in its images, restricted to vectors with even Hamming weight. Additionally, we see that all bent functions are balanced when we restrict to vectors of even Hamming weight or to vectors with odd Hamming weight. Given the necessary tools, we provide a simpler algorithm to obtain new bent functions using Maiorana-McFarland.</description>

      <title>Simple formulas of $\pi$ in terms of $\Phi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After a brief list of most known formulas of PI in terms of PHI, a short calculation of a known family of formulas of PI is shared, revisiting old Archimedes' and F. Viete's algorithms. This allows to identify two simple formulas of PI in terms of the golden ratio PHI in the form of infinite nested square roots. Applying the same criteria, a third formula is given, that brings to the known Dixon's approximate squaring of the circle, then an easier approach is suggested by a rectangle with both sides proportional to the golden ratio PHI.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean Cross-Ratios and Carnot's Theorem for Conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When considering geometry, one might think of working with lines and circles on a flat plane as in Euclidean geometry. However, doing geometry in other spaces is possible, as the existence of spherical and hyperbolic geometry demonstrates. Despite the differences between these three geometries, striking connections appear among the three. In this paper, we illuminate one such connection by generalizing the cross-ratio, a powerful invariant associating a number to four points on a line, into non-Euclidean geometry. Along the way, we see how projections between these geometries can allow us to directly export results from one geometry into the others. The paper culminates by generalizing Carnot's Theorem for Conics - a classical result relating when six points on a triangle lie on a conic - into spherical and hyperbolic geometry. These same techniques are then applied to Carnot's Theorem for higher degree curves.</description>

      <title>Metacategory and Geometric Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Categorial Topology, given a category (as a "geometric object") we can consider its properties preserved under continuous action (a "deformation") of a comma-propagation operation. However, the Metacategory space, valid for all categories, can not be defined by using well-know Grothendeick's approach with discrete ringed spaces. So, we can consider any category as an abstract geometric object, that is, a discrete space where the points are the objects of this category and arrows between objects as the paths. Based on this approach, we define the Cat-vector space V valid for all categories with noncommutative (and partial) addition operation for the vectors, and their inner product. For the categories wher4e we define the norm ("length") of the vectors in V we can define also the outer (wedge) product of the vectors in V and we show that such Cat-algebra satisfies two fundamental properties of the Clifford geometric algebra.</description>

      <title>Analogue of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for determinants: a simple proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present a simple proof of an analogue of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality relevant to products of determinants. Specifically, we show that $$ |\det(A^*MB)|^2\leq \det(A^*MA)\cdot \det(B^*MB),\quad A,B\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times n},$$ where $M\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times m}$ is hermitian positive definite. Here $m$ and $n$ are arbitrary. In case $m\leq n$, equality holds trivially. Equality holds when $m&gt;n$ and $\text{rank}(A)=\text{rank}(B)=n$ if and only if the columns of $A$ and the columns of $B$ span the same subspace of $\mathbb{C}^m$.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Type Inequalities and Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two double Jordan-type inequalities are introduced based on the papers [1]-[5]. These inequalities generalize the inequalities obtained in [1]-[5]. As a result, some new upper and lower bounds of the sinc function are obtained. This extension of Jordan's inequality is enabled by considering the corresponding inequalities through the concept of stratified families of functions elaborated in [6]. Based on this approach, some optimal approximations of the sinc function are derived by determining corresponding minimax approximants, also described in the paper [6].</description>

      <title>The diophantine equation $x^4+y^4=z^4+w^4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 1772, when Euler first described two methods of obtaining two pairs of biquadrates with equal sums, several methods of solving the diophantine equation $x^4+y^4=z^4+w^4$ have been published. All these methods yield parametric solutions in terms of homogeneous bivariate polynomials of odd degrees. In this paper we describe a method that yields three parametric solutions of the aforesaid diophantine equation in terms of homogeneous bivariate polynomials of even degrees, namely degrees~$74$, $88$ and $132$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Dynamic Formulation for the Collatz Conjecture: I. Local and Quasi-global Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a symbolic dynamical formulation based upon discrete iterative mappings derived from the Collatz conjecture is introduced. It is demonstrated that this formulation naturally induces a ternary alphabet useful for characterizing the expansive and dissipative behavior of generated itineraries. Furthermore, local and quasi-global analyses indicate cyclic behaviors that should prove useful for describing global stability properties of itineraries. Additionally, techniques for generating arbitrarily long divergent itineraries are presented. Finally, this symbolic formulation allows itineraries to be grouped into sequence families that retain equivalent dynamical behavior.</description>

      <title>The Problem of Split Equality Fixed-Point and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally known that in order to solve the split equality fixed-point problem (SEFPP), it is necessary to compute the norm of bounded and linear operators, which is a challenging task in real life, to address this issue, we studied the SEFPP involving the class of quasi-pseudocontractive mappings in Hilbert spaces and constructed novel algorithms in this regards, and we proved the algorithms' convergence both with and without prior knowledge of the operator norm for bounded and linear mappings. Additionally, we gave applications and numerical examples of our findings. A variety of well-known discoveries revealed in the literature are generalized by the findings presented in this work.</description>
