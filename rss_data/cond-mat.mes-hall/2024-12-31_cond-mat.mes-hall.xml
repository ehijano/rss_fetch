      <title>Aharonov-Bohm Interference in Even-Denominator Fractional Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Position exchange of non-Abelian anyons affects the quantum state of their system in a topologically-protected way. Their expected manifestations in even-denominator fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems offer the opportunity to directly study their unique statistical properties in interference experiments. In this work, we present the observation of coherent Aharonov-Bohm interference at two even-denominator states in high-mobility bilayer graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures by employing the Fabry-P\'erot interferometry (FPI) technique. Operating the interferometer at a constant filling factor, we observe an oscillation period corresponding to two flux quanta inside the interference loop, $\Delta\Phi=2\Phi_0$, at which the interference does not carry signatures of non-Abelian statistics. The absence of the expected periodicity of $\Delta\Phi=4\Phi_0$ may indicate that the interfering quasiparticles carry the charge $e^* = \frac{1}{2}e$ or that interference of $e^* = \frac{1}{4}e$ quasiparticles is thermally smeared. Interestingly, at two hole-conjugate states, we also observe oscillation periods of half the expected value, indicating interference of $e^* = \frac{2}{3}e$ quasiparticles instead of $e^* = \frac{1}{3}e$. To probe statistical phase contributions, we operated the FPI with controlled deviations of the filling factor, thereby introducing fractional quasiparticles inside the interference loop. The resulting changes to the interference patterns at both half-filled states indicate that the additional bulk quasiparticles carry the fundamental charge $e^*=\frac{1}{4}e$, as expected for non-Abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Double Quantum Dot Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effect (SDE) is theoretically examined in double quantum dot coupled to three superconducting leads, $L$, $R1$ and $R2$. Lead $L$ is commonly connected to two quantum dots (QD1, QD2) while lead $R1$ ($R2$) is connected to QD1 (QD2) only. The phase differences $\varphi_{1}$ between leads $L$ and $R1$ and $\varphi_{2}$ between leads $L$ and $R2$ are tuned independently. The critical current into lead $R1$ depends on its direction unless $\varphi_{2} = 0$, $\pi$, which is ascribable to the formation of Andreev molecule between the QDs. In the absence of electron-electron interaction $U$ in the QDs, the spectrum of the Andreev bound states forms Dirac cones in the $\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}$ plane if the energy levels in the QDs are tuned to the Fermi level in the leads. The SDE is enhanced to almost 30\% when $\varphi_{2}$ is set to the value at the Dirac points. In the presence of $U$, the SDE is still observed when $U$ is smaller than the superconducting energy gap in the leads. Our device should be one of the minimal models for the SDE since a similar device with a single QD does not show the SDE.</description>

      <title>Exploring Grassmann manifolds in topological systems via quantum distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states defined over a parameter space form a Grassmann manifold. To capture the geometry of the associated gauge structure, gauge-invariant quantities are essential. We employ the projector of a multilevel system to quantify the quantum distance between states. Using the multidimensional scaling method, we transform the quantum distance into a reconstructed manifold embedded in Euclidean space. This approach is demonstrated with examples of topological systems, showcasing their topological features within these manifolds. Our method provides a comprehensive view of the manifold, rather than focusing on local properties.</description>

      <title>An Addressable and Tunable Module for Donor-based Scalable Silicon Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Donor-based spin qubit offers a promising silicon quantum computing route for building large-scale qubit arrays, attributed to its long coherence time and advancements in nanoscale donor placement. However, the state-of-the-art device designs face scalability challenges, notably in achieving tunable two-qubit coupling and ensuring qubit addressability. Here, we propose a surface-code-compatible architecture, where each module has both tunable two-qubit gates and addressable single-qubit gates by introducing only a single extra donor in a pair of donors. We found that to compromise between the requirement of tunability and that of addressability, an asymmetric scheme is necessary. In this scheme, the introduced extra donor is strongly tunnel-coupled to one of the donor spin qubits for addressable single-qubit operation, while being more weakly coupled to the other to ensure the turning on and off of the two-qubit operation. The fidelity of single-qubit and two-qubit gates can exceed the fault-tolerant threshold in our design. Additionally, the asymmetric scheme effectively mitigates valley oscillations, allowing for engineering precision tolerances up to a few nanometers. Thus, our proposed scheme presents a promising prototype for large-scale, fault-tolerant, donor-based spin quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism Induced Topological Phase Transitions in Kane-Mele Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that Chern number tunable quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and second-order topological insulators can be induced in the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological insulator (TI), i.e., Kane-Mele model, by applying $d$-wave altermagnetism. When the N\'eel vector of altermagentism lies in the $x-y$ plane, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ TI is broken and driven into a second-order topological insulator phase, exhibiting the representative corner states at nanoflakes. When the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is further included, the second-order TI is further driven into the QAHE phase with various Chern numbers (e.g., $\mathcal{C}=\pm1$ or $\pm3$). When the N\'eel vector is along $z$ direction, the intrinsic Rashba spin-orbit coupling is necessary to break the mirror symmetry to allow a sequential emergence of second-order TI and QAHE along with the increase of altermagentism strength. We also observe the QAHE with mixed-chirality, i.e., there exist counter-propagating edge modes but net chiral current at the ribbon boundary. Our work shows that altermagnetism can play a crucial role in exploring a rich variety of topological phases, just like its counterparts of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired design of a tunable broadband high-Q acoustic resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonators with a high quality factor (Q) are crucial components in a wide range of advanced technologies, including energy harvesting, chemical and biological sensing, and second-harmonic generation. Many applications also require resonance across a broad frequency range. However, single-cavity resonators face a fundamental trade-off between bandwidth and quality factor. Here we propose an acoustic resonator that overcomes this limitation by drawing inspiration from the ladder of harmonic oscillator states observed in twisted van der Waals heterostructures. By simulating an acoustic analog of twisted bilayer graphene, we discover a tunable ladder of acoustic resonances with Q as high as 4,000. These resonances are separated by as little as 10 Hz and persist over a bandwidth as broad as 1 kHz, forming an effective high-Q, broadband system. Our approach offers a promising pathway to overcome the inherent trade-offs in traditional resonators and paves the way for advanced high-Q acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Hofstadter cascade in a twisted semiconductor homobilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e homobilayers have emerged as a platform in which magnetism, strong correlations, and topology are intertwined. In a large magnetic field, the energetic alignment of states with different spin in these systems is dictated by both strong Zeeman splitting and the structure of the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum, yet the latter has been difficult to probe experimentally. Here we conduct local thermodynamic measurements of twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers that reveal a cascade of magnetic phase transitions. We understand these transitions as the filling of individual Hofstadter subbands, allowing us to extract the structure and connectivity of the Hofstadter spectrum of a single spin. The onset of magnetic transitions is independent of twist angle, indicating that the exchange interactions of the component layers are only weakly modified by the moir\'e potential. In contrast, the magnetic transitions are associated with stark changes in the insulating states at commensurate filling. Our work achieves a spin-resolved measurement of Hofstadter's butterfly despite overlapping states, and it disentangles the role of material and moir\'e effects on the nature of the correlated ground states.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces and breather dynamics of analytic solutions in chiral magnets without Heisenberg exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the special case of the chiral magnet with vanishing Heisenberg exchange energy, whose axisymmetric Skyrmion solution has previously been found. The dynamical equations of this model look like inviscid fluid flow, and by investigating path-lines of this flow we can construct explicit static and dynamic solutions. We find an infinite-dimensional family of static Skyrmions that are related to the axisymmetric Skyrmion by co-ordinate transformations thus discovering a new moduli space, and further infinite-dimensional families of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric breather-like supercompactons. We call the maps generating such moduli space "contour-preserving" maps.</description>

      <title>On the band topology of the breathing kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional second-order topological insulator exhibits topologically protected zero-energy states at its corners. In the literature, the breathing kagome lattice with nearest-neighbor hopping is often mentioned as an example of a two-dimensional second-order topological insulator. Here we show by explicit construction that the corner states of the breathing kagome lattice can be removed by a continuous change of the hopping parameters, without breaking any of the model's symmetries, without closing bulk and boundary gaps, and without introducing hopping terms not present in the original model. Furthermore, we topologically classify all three-band lattice models with the same crystalline symmetries as the breathing kagome lattice and show that though none of the phases have protected zero-energy corner states, some of the phases are obstructed atomic limits which exhibit a filling anomaly.</description>

      <title>Mott and Wiedemann Franz Law for Monolayer Graphene for Different Scattering Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review and analysis of the thermoelectric responses exhibited by monolayer pristine graphene in response to temperature variations. Employing the Boltzmann transport theory, we rigorously examined and evaluated various thermoelectric coefficients, with particular emphasis on elucidating their behavior under different scattering mechanisms. We derived the analytical expressions for electrical conductivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity at low temperatures by Sommerfeld expansion of the Fermi integral. We demonstrated that our numerically obtained values are consistent with the analytical calculations at low temperatures and hence obeying Mott and Wiedeman Franz law. However, the deviation was observed at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we performed theoretical calculations of chemical potential at both low and high temperatures and compared them with our numerically evaluated results at all temperatures. Through extensive calculations and meticulous evaluation, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate thermoelectric properties inherent in monolayer pristine graphene.</description>

      <title>Phonon-Induced Effects in Quantum Dot Absorption and Resonance Fluorescence with Hierarchy of Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum dot (QD) system coupled to a vibrational environment with a super-Ohmic spectral density and weakly to a leaky cavity mode, a model relevant for semiconductor-based single-photon sources. The phonon coupling induces dephasing and broadens the absorption and emission line shapes, while the weakly coupled cavity mode leads to effective driving of the QD. To capture non-Markovian effects, we use non-Markovian Quantum State Diffusion and its hierarchical extension the Hierarchy of Pure States to compute multitime correlation functions underlying absorption and resonance fluorescence spectra. We present numerical results for the absorption spectra at strong phonon coupling and finite temperature, as well as for resonance fluorescence spectra at varying phonon coupling strengths and temperatures, and analyse the visibility of the resonance fluorescence spectra to provide insights into how phonon coupling and thermal effects influence the spectral features.</description>

      <title>Theory of Valley Splitting in Si/SiGe Spin-Qubits: Interplay of Strain, Resonances and Random Alloy Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron spin-qubits in silicon-germanium (SiGe) heterostructures are a major candidate for the realization of scalable quantum computers. A critical challenge in strained Si/SiGe quantum wells (QWs) is the existence of two nearly degenerate valley states at the conduction band minimum that can lead to leakage of quantum information. To address this issue, various strategies have been explored to enhance the valley splitting (i.e., the energy gap between the two low-energy conduction band minima), such as sharp interfaces, oscillating germanium concentrations in the QW and shear strain engineering. In this work, we develop a comprehensive envelope-function theory augmented by the empirical pseudopotential method to incorporate the effects of alloy disorder, strain, and non-trivial resonances arising from interaction between valley states across different Brillouin zones. We apply our model to analyze common epitaxial profiles studied in the literature and compare our results with previous work. This framework provides an efficient tool for quantifying the interplay of these effects on the valley splitting, enabling complex epitaxial profile optimization in future work.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Classification of Non-Hermitian Topological Phases under Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into fundamental science has opened new possibilities to address long-standing scientific challenges rooted in mathematical limitations. For example, topological invariants are used to characterize topology, but there is no universally applicable one. This limitation explains why, in the past decades-long classification of topological phases of matter -- mainly focused on Hermitian systems -- many phases initially classified ``trivial" were later identified as topological. Recently, the discovery of non-Hermitian band topology has spurred substantial efforts in non-Hermitian topological classification, including the development of new topological invariants. However, such classifications similarly risk overlooking key topological features. Here, without relying on any topological invariant, we develop an AI-based unsupervised classification of symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases. This algorithm distinguishes topological differences among non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with symmetries, and constructs, in an unsupervised manner, a topological periodic table for non-Hermitian systems. Additionally, it can account for the boundary effects, enabling the exploration of open-boundary effects on the topological phase diagram. These results introduce an unsupervised approach for classifying symmetry-protected non-Hermitian topological phases without omission and provide valuable guidance for the development of theories and experiments.</description>

      <title>Electrical switching of altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switching magnetism using only electricity is of great significance for information applications but remains challenging. We find that, altermagnetism, as a newly discovered unconventional magnetism, may open an avenue along this effort. Specifically, to have deterministic switching, i.e., reversing current direction must reverse magnetic structure, parity symmetry has to be broken. We discover that due to their symmetry that depends on chemical environments, altermagnet devices may naturally carry the parity symmetry breaking required for deterministic electrical switching of magnetism. More importantly, we identify MnTe and FeS bilayers as candidate devices. This scheme will inspire further explorations on unconventional magnetism and potential applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last years there has been much interest, and theoretical discussion, about the possibility to use spin-orbit coupling to control the carriers spins in two-dimensional semiconducting heterostructures. Spin polarization at the sample edges may occur as the response of systems with strong SO-coupling to an external transport current, an effect known as spin Hall effect. Here, we show that in a 2DEG with Rashba SO-coupling, spin polarization near the sample edge can develop kinematically for low electron densities.

      <title>Ultrasonic-assisted liquid phase exfoliation for high-yield monolayer graphene with enhanced crystallinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene stands as a promising material with vast potential across energy storage, electronics, etc. Here, we present a novel mechanical approach utilizing ultrasonic high-energy intercalation exfoliation to extract monolayer graphene from graphite, offering a simple yet efficient alternative to conventional methods. Through a comprehensive series of characterizations involving atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the resulting graphene nanosheets demonstrate superior crystallinity compared to those obtained via the conventional method. The high-crystalline freestanding graphene nanosheets derived from this method not only facilitate easier separation but also significantly enhance the physical performance of the original materials. This method showcases the potential for scalable production of layered materials with increased yield and crystallinity, paving the way for their utilization in various applications.</description>

      <title>An ab-initio study on engineering quantum anomalous Hall effect in compensated antiferromagnet MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) has been theoretically proposed in compensated antiferromagnetic systems by using the magnetic topological insulator model [see arXiv:2404.13305 (2024)]. However, the related and systematic study based on a realistic material system is still limited. As the only experimentally realized antiferromagnetic topological insulator, MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ becomes a vital platform for exploring various topological states. In this work, by using the comprehensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the QAHE can also be realized in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ without combined parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry. Using a magnetic topological insulator model, the layer-resolved Chern number is calculated to further understand the physical origin of different Chern numbers. The application of external hydrostatic pressure can strengthen the Te-Te quasicovalent bond due to the dramatic compression of the van der Waals gap. Thus, the resulting topological nontrivial gap can exceed the room-temperature energy scale in a wide range of pressures. Additionally, we find that constructing MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$/CrI$_{3}$ heterostructure can realize the compensated antiferromagnetic configurations with QAHE. Our findings illustrate the realization of QAHE in compensated antiferromagnetic even-septuple-layer MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and provide a reliable strategy to obtain the corresponding magnetic configurations.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Reversible Electrical Tuning of Fluorescent Decay Rate via Fano Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decay rate of an atomic or molecular dipole depends on the local density of optical states (LDOS) -- Purcell effect -- which can significantly be enhanced near a dielectric-core metal-shell nanoparticle (CSNP). On top of that, an auxiliary quantum object (QO) can introduce a Fano transparency in the plasmonic spectrum of the CSNP. Here, we show that an auxiliary QO, located at the hotspot of the CSNP, can modify the LDOS, hence the decay rate of an excited dipole. Moreover, by controlling the resonance of the auxiliary QO via an applied voltage, one can continuously and reversibly tune both the radiative and nonradiative decay rates of the dipole up to 2 orders-of-magnitude. This phenomenon emerges as an invaluable tool to implement in integrated quantum technologies, enabling realization of on-demand entanglement/single-photon sources, controlled execution of quantum gates and electrical-control of superradiant-like phase transitions. It also bears potential for application in super-resolution microscopy and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).</description>

      <title>Designing Spin-driven Multiferroics in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-driven multiferroics exhibit strong magnetoelectric coupling, with notable polarization changes under a magnetic field, but these effects are usually limited to high-Z magnetic insulators with low electronic polarization. In this work, we introduce altermagnets as a promising platform for achieving strong magnetoelectric coupling in low-Z systems with substantial polarization. This large polarization arises from a design principle that utilizes the Heisenberg-like exchange striction mechanism, eliminating the reliance on spin-orbit coupling (SOC). This approach enables the Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnetic phase derived from altermagnetic insulators to achieve substantial polarization without spin splitting, providing a flexible platform for regulating spin-splitting phenomena. Through first-principles simulations and an effective Landau-Ginzburg Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that materials in the LiMnO2 family and strained RuF4 family can achieve polarization values exceeding 1.0 {\mu}C/cm2, an order of magnitude larger than those found in SOC-driven multiferroics. Moreover, their magnetoelectric coupling is one to two orders of magnitude stronger than that observed in conventional multiferroics and those driven by SOC.</description>

      <title>Insulator and Electrode Materials Marginally Influence Carbonized Layer Conductivity in Metalized-Film Capacitors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capacitor self-healing is a generalized term to describe physical and chemical processes restoring the functionalities of a dielectric capacitor after an electrical breakdown. The efficacy of self-healing depends on the elemental composition of a metalized-film capacitor. We report atomistic simulations of self-healing from a chemical perspective proving the impossibility of tuning the electrical conductivity of the soot by finding an interplay of various polymers and electrodes. All investigated soot samples turn out to possess carbon-rich semiconducting skeletons with numerous unsaturated C-C covalent bonds. They exhibit electrical conductivities of the same order of magnitude, irrespective of initial chemical compositions and properties of the chosen insulating polymers. Upon reporting the new results, we discuss less evident approaches to diminish the soot conductivity. We conclude that the quality of capacitor self-healing can be assessed by counting gaseous by-products of electrical breakdown or evaluating the volume of the solid-state semiconducting counterpart.</description>

Abstract: We establish the theoretical framework for a material system that supports surface plasmon polaritions (SPPs) excited by a dipole excitation, where the media configuration suddenly changes at a temporal boundary. We employ three-dimensional Green's function analysis in the Laplace transform domain. We use this framework to demonstrate dynamic SPP formation and time-boundary-induced interference of slow and fast propagating SPPs. This analysis provides insight into how SPPs are formed in time and how they interfere at a temporal boundary.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torque in a three-fold-symmetric bilayer and its effect on magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Field-free switching of perpendicular magnetization has been observed in an epitaxial L1$_1$-ordered CoPt/CuPt bilayer and attributed to spin-orbit torque (SOT) arising from the crystallographic $3m$ point group of the interface. Using a first-principles nonequilibrium Green's function formalism combined with the Anderson disorder model, we calculate the angular dependence of the SOT in a CoPt/CuPt bilayer and find that the magnitude of the $3m$ SOT is about 20% of the conventional dampinglike SOT. We further study the magnetization dynamics in perpendicularly magnetized films in the presence of $3m$ SOT and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, using the equations of motion for domain wall dynamics and micromagnetic simulations. We find that for systems with strong interfacial DMI characterized by the N\'eel character of domain walls, a very large current density is required to achieve deterministic switching because reorientation of the magnetization inside the domain wall is necessary to induce the switching asymmetry. For thicker films with relatively weak interfacial DMI and the Bloch character of domain walls the deterministic switching with much smaller currents is possible, which agrees with recent experimental findings.</description>

      <title>The Smearing of Quasi-Particles: Signatures in the Entanglement Entropy of Excited Many-Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement spectrum serves as a powerful tool for probing the structure and dynamics of quantum many-body systems, revealing key information about symmetry, topology, and excitations. While the entanglement entropy (EE) of ground states typically follows an area law, highly excited states obey a volume law, leading to a striking contrast in their scaling behavior. In this paper, we investigate the crossover between these two regimes, focusing on the role of quasi-particles (QPs) in mediating this transition. By analyzing the energy dependence of EE in various many-body systems, we explore how the presence of long-lived QPs influences the entanglement structure of excited states. We present numerical results for spinless fermions, a spin chain near a many-body localization transition, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which lacks a conventional QP description. Our findings are complemented by a theoretical model based on Fermi liquid theory, providing insight into the interaction-dependent scaling of EE and its consistency with numerical simulations. We find that a hallmark of QPs is a linear dependence of the eigenstate EE on energy, which breaks down at high energy and in the limit of strong interaction. The slope of this linear dependence reflects the QP weight, which reduces with interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Cascades in transport and optical conductivity of Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a combined Dynamical Mean Field Theory and Hartree (DMFT+H) calculation we study the transport and optical properties of the 8-band heavy fermion model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) in the normal state. We find resistive states around integer fillings which resemble the ones observed in transport experiments. From a Drude fitting of the low frequency optical conductivity, we extract a very strongly doping-dependent Drude weight and scattering rate, resetting at the integers. For most dopings, particularly above the integers, the Drude scattering rate is high but notably smaller than that of the local electrons. This highlights the important role of itinerant electrons in the transport properties, despite their limited spectral weight on the flat bands. At far infrared frequencies, the optical conductivity exhibits cascades characterized by highly asymmetric resets of the intensity and oscillations in the interband peak frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on molecular dynamics simulations of the atomic structure and diffusion processes at Al(110)/Si(001) interphase boundary created by simulated vapor deposition of Al(Si) alloy onto Si(001) substrate. An array of parallel misfit dislocations of both full and partial types is observed at the interface. Si atoms segregate to the misfit dislocations, with segregation to full dislocations being stronger. The interface diffusion is dominated by short-circuit diffusion along the misfit dislocations, creating a significant diffusion anisotropy. Diffusion of Al and Si atoms along the full misfit dislocations is faster than along the partial misfit dislocations. Due to the presence of the misfit dislocations, diffusion at the Al(110)/Si(001) interface studied here is faster than diffusion at the Al(111)/Si(111) interfaces investigated in our previous work.</description>

      <title>Fractional quantum Hall states by Feynman's diagrammatic expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect arises from strong electron correlations in a quantising magnetic field, and features exotic emergent phenomena such as electron fractionalisation. Using the diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach with the combinatorial summation algorithm, we obtain results with controlled accuracy for the microscopic model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level. As the temperature is lowered, we study the development and emergence of the incompressible 1/3-filled FQH state. By analysing the long-time decay of the Green's function, we find spectral properties consistent with an energy gap near 1/3-filling, while at half-filling an anomalous power law scaling is observed for short-range interaction screening, indicative of a non-Fermi liquid metal. Our work provides the first demonstration that fractionalised phases of matter can be reliably described with Feynman's diagrammatic technique in terms of the fundamental electronic degrees of freedom, while also showing applicability of expansions in the bare Coulomb potential for precision calculations.</description>

Abstract: We present new results on quantum tunneling between deep potential wells, in the presence of a strong constant magnetic field. We construct a family of double well potentials containing examples for which the low-energy eigenvalue splitting vanishes, and hence quantum tunneling is eliminated. Further, by deforming within this family, the magnetic ground state can be made to transition from symmetric to anti-symmetric. However, for typical double wells in a certain regime, tunneling is not suppressed, and we provide a lower bound for the eigenvalue splitting.</description>

      <title>Eigenstructure Analysis of Bloch Wave and Multislice Matrix Formulations for Dynamical Scattering in Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the eigenstructure of matrix formulations used for modeling scattering processes in materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Considering dynamical scattering is fundamental in describing the interaction between an electron wave and the material under investigation. In TEM, both the Bloch wave formulation and the multislice method are commonly employed to model the scattering process, but comparing these models directly is challenging. Unlike the Bloch wave formulation, which represents the transmission function in terms of the scattering matrix, the traditional multislice method does not have a pure transmission function due to the entanglement between electron waves and the propagation function within the crystal. To address this, we propose a reformulation of the multislice method into a matrix framework, which we refer to as transmission matrix. This enables a direct comparison to the well-known scattering matrix, derived from the Bloch wave formulation, and analysis of their eigenstructures. We show theoretically that both matrices are equal, under the condition that the angles of the eigenvalues differ no more than modulo $2\pi n$ for integer $n$, and the eigenvectors of the transmission and scattering matrix are related in terms of a two-dimensional Fourier matrix. The characterization of both matrices in terms of physical parameters, such as total projected potentials, is also discussed, and we perform numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings. Finally, we show that the determinant of the transmission matrix can be used to estimate the mean inner potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09931v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 2D materials can host interesting physics and have important applications in various fields. Recent experiment shows that monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoflakes with neutral zigzag edges are stable. Here, we study semiconducting stoichiometric PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons with the stable neutral zigzag edges (with $N$ describing different nanoribbon width) through combining detailed first-principles investigation with low-energy model analysis. Our careful analysis of first-principles conduction and valence bands (with the spin-orbits coupling taken into account) indicates that the low-energy bands assume relativistic energy dispersion in an energy window of [-0.2 eV, 0.2eV] (at least) and have large unconventional Rashba spin splitting (for even $N$). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the low-energy bands can be well described by an effective one-dimensional electron model and the semiconductor gap will remain finite even for large $N$. Most importantly, it is shown that there exists SU(2) spin symmetry in both of the conduction and valence bands for each edge, which implies persistent spin helices (in the spin xy plane) and spin-conserving carrier transport. When the inter-edge interaction becomes weak ($N$ is large enough), a nearly-perfect Dirac fermion system can be achieved through combining the valence and conduction bands. Thus we realize unconventional Rashba splitting, double SU(2) spin symmetry, persistent spin helices/textures, and pure Dirac fermion systems in stable monolayer PtSe$_2$ nanoribbons.</description>

Abstract: Reducing the contact resistance of field-effect transistors based on two-dimensional materials is one of the key improvements required to enable the integration of such transistors in an advanced semiconductor manufacturing process. Suitably designed lateral heterojunctions provide an opportunity to independently tailor the contact and channel properties in order to optimize contact resistance. Inspired by the recent experimental demonstration of a two-dimensional $p$-type Schottky barrier, here we use quantum transport simulations to estimate the performance of $p$-type transistors in which the channel consists of a lateral heterostructure of NbS$_2$/MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ (semimetal-semiconductor-semimetal). We find that the gate alignment with the channel is a critical design parameter, strongly influencing the capability of the gate to modulate the Schottky barrier at the MoS$_2$/NbS$_2$ interface. This effect is also found to significantly affect the scaling behavior of the device.</description>

Abstract: To control the magnon transport in magnetic systems is of great interest in magnonics. Due to the feasibility of electric field, how to generate and manipulate magnon with pure electrical method is one of the most desired goals. Here we propose that the magnon spin current is generated by applying time-dependent electric field, where the coupling between the magnon and electric field is invoked via Aharonov-Casher effect. In particular, the magnon spin current is dominated by electric field component which perpendicular to the magnetization direction. We apply our theory to 1D ferromagnetic SSH model and show that the generated magnon spin current is closely related to the band geometry. Our findings expands the horizons of magnonics and electric-control-magnon mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Entropic signature of resonant thermal transport: Ordered form of heat conduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermal transport in crystals is influenced by chemistry, boundaries, and nanostructure. The anharmonic phonon band structure extracted from molecular-dynamics simulations provides an illuminating view of both the type and extent of prevalence of wavelike mechanisms underlying the transport, yet falls short of elucidating the nature of thermal evolution for different phonon regimes. Here we present an analysis framework for the characterization of the entropic signature of the mechanisms induced by boundaries and nanostructure, using both equilibrium and nonequilibrium atomistic simulations. Specifically, we examine the effects of phonon confinement, Bragg scattering, and local resonances on the configurational phase space in room-temperature nanostructured silicon, and quantify how each modifies the rate of entropy production and thermal relaxation. We reveal that the presence of phonon local resonances spanning the full spectrum enables a highly ordered regime of heat conduction to be approached, where irreversible evolution and entropy maximization are severely hindered by extensive mode hybridizations caused by the resonances. This unique regime of transport paves the way for ultra-precise phonon control for a wide range of applications in condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: We study non-Hermitian Josephson junctions formed by multiple superconductors and discover the emergence of exceptional points entirely determined by the interplay of the distinct superconducting phases and non-Hermiticity due to normal reservoirs. In particular, in Josephson junctions with three and four superconductors, we find stable lines and surfaces of exceptional points protected by non-Hermitian topology and highly tuneable by the superconducting phases. We also discover that, in Josephson junctions formed by laterally coupled superconductors, exceptional points can result from hybridized Andreev bound states and lead to the enhancement of supercurrents controlled by dissipation. Our work unveils the potential of multi-terminal Josephson junctions for realizing higher dimensional topological non-Hermitian superconducting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Polarizability and Tunable Diamagnetic Shifts from Charged Localized Emitters in WSe2 on a Relaxor Ferroelectric</title>

Abstract: Strain modulation is a crucial way in engineering nanoscale materials. It is even more important for single photon emitters in layered materials, where strain can create quantum emitters and control their energies. Here we report the localized, charge-enhanced coupling between the charged localized emitters in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe2) to the piezoelectric relaxor ferroelectric substrate. In addition to the strain effect, we observe a gigantic polarizability volume with the enhancement factor up to 1010. The enormous polarizability leads to a large Quantum-confined Stark shift under a small variation of electric field, indicating the potential of integrating layered materials with functional substrates for quantum sensing. We further demonstrate the tunable diamagnetic shift and g-factor with strain varying by ~0.05%, which confirms the existence of enhanced interaction between the localized oscillating dipoles and the ferroelectric domains. Our results signify the prospect of charged quantum emitters in layered materials for quantum sciences and technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17611v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the coexistence of tunneling spin and valley Hall effects when electrons in graphene coherently transmit through a barrier with the broken inversion symmetry and proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. Due to the rotation of the pseudospin in the tunneling process, the transmitted electrons acquire a finite spin- and valley-dependent backreflection geometric phase when the two interfaces of the barrier are asymmetric. This results in a spin- and valley-dependent skew coherent tunneling, which is responsible for the transverse spin and valley Hall currents. We further demonstrate that the coherent-tunneling assisted charge-spin and charge-valley conversions are highly efficient with large Hall angles. Our work provides a new route for the generation of efficient spin and valley Hall effects, suggesting potential applications for spintronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Acoustic modulation of quantum dots allows one to control the scattering of photons. Here we theoretically characterize the degree of this acoustic control in the frequency domain. We formulate the theory of low-intensity resonance fluorescence in the presence of white noise and show that a high level of control is achievable with a two-tone acoustic field for appropriate settings of modulation amplitudes as long as the noise-induced phase diffusion coefficient remains one order of magnitude smaller than the acoustic frequency. In addition, using a quantitative model of optical signal collection, we determine that the acoustic phase must be stable over $\mathbf{10^4}$ to $\mathbf{10^5}$ acoustic periods for efficient control.</description>

      <title>Backbone Mediated Electrical Transport in a Double-Stranded DNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of DNA nanotechnology, it is common wisdom that charge transport occurs through the {\pi} stacked bases of double-stranded DNA. However, recent experimental findings by Zhuravel et. al. [Nat. Nanotech. 15, 836 (2020)] suggest that electronic transport happens through the backbone channels instead of {\pi}-{\pi} interaction of the nitrogen bases. These new experimental insights call for a detail investigation. In keeping with this, we examine charge transport properties of three characteristic double-stranded DNA sequences (periodic GC, periodic AT and random ATGC sequences) within a tight-binding framework where backbones form the main conduction channels. Using techniques based on the Green function method, we inspect the single-particle density of states and localization properties of DNA in the presence of discontinuities (nicks) along the backbone channels. We also investigate the effect of these nicks on current-voltage response using the Landauer - Buttiker formalism for a two-terminal geometry where the source electrode is attached to one backbone strand and the drain to the other. We observe that the periodic DNA sequence of GC bases is metallic in nature, while the periodic AT sequence and the random ATGC sequence are insulating. Further, the effects of nicks on the transport properties of the periodic GC sequence is interesting: while a single nick on the upper backbone does not affect electronic transport, the addition of a second nick on the lower backbone causes the current to vanish altogether. This is found to be robust against changes in the positions of the nicks, as well as the alternation of the source and drain electrodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of self-hybridized thermal magnetoplasmons in doped graphene nanodisks at finite temperatures when subjected to an external magnetic field. Using a semianalytical approach, which fully describes the eigenmodes and polarizability of the graphene nanodisks, we show that the hybridization originates from the coupling of transitions between thermally populated Landau levels and localized magnetoplasmon resonances of the nanodisks. Owing to their origin, these modes combine the extraordinary magneto-optical response of graphene with the strong field enhancement of plasmons, making them an ideal tool for achieving strong chiral light-matter interactions, with the additional advantage of being tunable through carrier concentration, magnetic field, and temperature. As a demonstration of their capabilities, we show that the thermal magnetoplasmons supported by an array of graphene nanodisks enable chiral perfect absorption and chiral thermal emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order topological superconductors host Majorana corner modes (MCMs), which are confined to specific corners of the system. This spatial restriction presents challenges for manipulating and relocating MCMs. We propose a novel protocol for dynamically controlling the movement of time-reversal symmetric MCMs in a heterostructure consisting of a 2D Weyl semimetal and a $d$-wave superconductor. By leveraging the energy asymmetry of topological edge states in the 2D Weyl semimetal, the position of MCMs can be effectively tuned via chemical potential adjustments. We further introduce a device architecture that integrates multiple heterostructure blocks, each controlled by independent gate voltages, to enable the adiabatic movement and exchange of MCMs. This approach demonstrates a robust mechanism for Majorana manipulation and provides a scalable framework for future experimental studies of topological quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$, focusing on spin-valley-resolved Hall conductivity, Chern numbers, Berry curvature, and Nernst coefficient. Spin-valley-dependent electronic states with distinct spin textures offer potential applications in spintronic devices. Our calculations reveal helical and chiral spin texture for spin-up, and spin-down respectively, by opposing electron and hole orientation in the conduction and valence bands. The Berry curvature behavior in the vicinity of the Dirac points for different values of $\alpha$, reveals a sign change and topological phase transitions in 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$. When $\alpha&lt;1$, the system exhibits the Quantum Spin Hall Insulator (QSHI) phase ($C_s=1$), characterized by a non-trivial gap and helical edge mode. $\alpha&gt;1$ is responsible for a topological phase transition to the band insulator (BI) ($C_v=1$) and killing the edge modes. Also when $\alpha=1$ the Fermi energy falls within the bands, consequently, the Chern number is not defined. Calculations of spin Nernst (SNC), valley Nernst (VNC), and total Nernst coefficients (TNC) further confirm the QSHI-to-BI phase transition under varying $\alpha$ and doping. These results provide comprehensive insights into the tunable topological properties of 1T$^{\prime}$-MoS$_2$ and their implications for spintronic and valleytronic applications.</description>

Abstract: A model of the non-concentric spherical core-shell quantum dot under the influence of an externally applied electric field was proposed. It was established that the energy spectrum of both the electron and the hole depends on the intensity of the electric field as well as on the specific location of the core within the quantum dot. The phenomenon of energy level splitting and degeneration was analyzed in detail. Additionally, the variations in the optical gap were determined and expressed as a function of the applied electric field strength and the position of the core in the quantum dot.</description>

Abstract: We study multiplicative Chern insulators (MCIs) as canonical examples of multiplicative topological phases of matter. Constructing the MCI Bloch Hamiltonian as a symmetry-protected tensor product of two topologically non-trivial parent Chern insulators (CIs), we study two-dimensional (2D) MCIs and introduce 3D mixed MCIs, constructed by requiring the two 2D parent Hamiltonians share only one momentum component. We study the 2D MCI response to time reversal symmetric flux insertion, observing a $4\pi$ Aharonov-Bohm effect, relating these topological states to fractional quantum Hall states via the effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. As part of this response, we observe evidence of quantisation of a proposed topological invariant for compactified many-body states, to a rational number, suggesting higher-dimensional topology may also be relevant. Finally, we study effects of bulk perturbations breaking the symmetry-protected tensor product structure of the child Hamiltonian, finding the MCI evolves adiabatically into a topological skyrmion phase.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given recent discovery of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, we re-examine the related canonical Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Within the framework of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect, isospin degree(s) of freedom of the BHZ model encode additional spatial dimensions. Consistent with this framework, we observe phenomena similar to those of the four dimensional Chern insulator, revealed by weakly breaking time-reversal symmetry. Bulk-boundary correspondence of these states includes real-space boundary orbital angular momentum textures and gapless boundary modes that are robust against magnetic disorder, consistent with compactified three dimensional boundary Weyl nodes (WN$_F$s) of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. These theoretical findings are furthermore consistent with past experimental work reporting unexpected edge conduction in HgTe quantum wells under applied Zeeman and orbital magnetic fields. This past work is therefore potentially the first known experimental observation of signatures of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect beyond the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dissipative tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>

Abstract: Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influence the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully adjustable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show a quantum simulator system that consists of a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity that can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout, based on a tunnel Josephson junction circuit, of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work is a first step for the development of analog molecule simulators of proton transfer reactions based on quantum superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Effect of arsenic doping on structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17664</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we studied the structural and electronic properties of MoSe$_2$ monolayer in its pure and doped forms, using the density functional theory (DFT), and the calculations were performed using Quantum Espresso (QE) software package. The doped systems are a MoSe$_2$ monolayer with a vacancy in Mo site (Mo vacancy system), the MoSe$_2$ monolayer with an As atom as substitutional for Mo atom (As(Mo) doped system) and an MoSe$_2$ monolayer with As atom in an interstitial site in the hollow location of the center of one ring of the structure between the plane Mo atoms and the plane containing Se atoms (As interstitial system). We calculated the formation energy of various structures studied in Se-rich condition. We found that the As(Mo) doped system is a favorable configuration, whereas the As interstitial system is metastable. Different defects introduce midgap levels, which were interpreted according to the orbitals involved in their formation using the analysis of the band structure and DOS and PDOS of each system. The energy gap increases in all system structures and its value ranged between 1.5 eV and 1.73 eV, the Fermi level shifts toward the valence band for the Mo vacancy system, and As(Mo) doped system which suggests that it can be a $p$-type semiconductor, whereas Fermi level shifts to the conduction band for As interstitial system and suggests a $n$-type semiconductor behavior. The obtained results enable us to predict the possibility of using these systems in many applications, since it can be used in the As(Mo) doped system in photocatalysis or in photovoltaic applications in the visible light, and As interstitial system can be used in electronics applications in the infrared field.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by phenomenology of myriad recently-identified topologically non-trivial phases of matter, we introduce effective field theories (EFTs) for the quantum skyrmion Hall effect (QSkHE). We employ a single, unifying generalisation for this purpose: in essence, a lowest Landau level projection defining a non-commutative, fuzzy sphere with position coordinates proportional to SU(2) generators of matrix representation size $N\times N$, may host an intrinsically 2+1 dimensional, topologically non-trivial many-body state for small $N$ as well as large $N$. That is, isospin degrees of freedom associated with a matrix Lie algebra with $N \times N$ generators potentially encode some finite number of spatial dimensions for $N\ge 2$, a regime in which isospin has previously been treated as a label. This statement extends to more general $p$-branes subjected to severe fuzzification as well as membranes. As a consequence of this generalisation, systems with $d$ Cartesian spatial coordinates and isospin degrees of freedom encoding an additional $\delta$ fuzzy coset space coordinates can realise topologically non-trivial states of intrinsic dimensionality up to $d$+$\delta$+1. We therefore identify gauge theories with extra fuzzy dimensions generalised to retain dependence upon gauge fields over fuzzy coset spaces even for severe fuzzification (small $N$), as EFTs for the QSkHE. We furthermore generalise these EFTs to space manifolds with local product structure exploiting the dimensional hierarchy of (fuzzy) spheres. For this purpose, we introduce methods of anisotropic fuzzification and propose formulating topological invariants on fuzzy coset spaces as artifacts of projecting matrix Lie algebras to occupied subspaces. Importantly, we focus on phenomenology indicating the 2+1 D SU(2) gauge theory should be generalised using this machinery, and serves as a minimal EFT of the QSkHE.</description>
