      <title>Absolute and Unconditional Convergence of Series of Ergodic Averages and Lebesgue Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider when there is absolute or unconditional convergence of series of various types of stochastic processes. These processes include differences of averages in ergodic theory and harmonic analysis, like the classical Cesaro average in ergodic theory and Lebesgue derivatives in harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>$k$-type chaos of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define and study the notions of $k$-type proximal pairs, $k$-type asymptotic pairs and $k$-type Li Yorke sensitivity for dynamical systems given by $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions on compact metric spaces. We prove the Auslander-Yorke dichotomy theorem for $k$-type notions. The preservation of some of these notions under uniform conjugacy is also studied. We also study relations between these notions and their analogous notions in the usual dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>On finitely many base $q$ expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given some integer $m \geq 3$, we find the first explicit collection of countably many intervals in $(1,2)$ such that for any $q$ in one of these intervals, the set of points with exactly $m$ base $q$ expansions is nonempty and moreover has positive Hausdorff dimension. Our method relies on an application of a theorem proved by Falconer and Yavicoli, which guarantees that the intersection of a family of compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ has positive Hausdorff dimension under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Disintegration results for fractal measures and applications to Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove disintegration results for self-conformal measures and affinely irreducible self-similar measures. The measures appearing in the disintegration resemble self-conformal/self-similar measures for iterated function systems satisfying the strong separation condition. As an application of our results, we prove the following Diophantine statements:
  1. Using a result of Pollington and Velani, we show that if $\mu$ is a self-conformal measure in $\mathbb{R}$ or an affinely irreducible self-similar measure, then there exists $\alpha&gt;0$ such that for all $\beta&gt;\alpha$ we have $$\mu\left(\left\{\mathbf{x}\in \mathbb{R}^{d}:\max_{1\leq i\leq d}|x_{i}-p_i/q|\leq \frac{1}{q^{\frac{d+1}{d}}(\log q)^{\beta}}\textrm{ for i.m. }(p_1,\ldots,p_d,q)\in \mathbb{Z}^{d}\times \mathbb{N}\right\}\right)=0.$$
  2. Using a result of Kleinbock and Weiss, we show that if $\mu$ is an affinely irreducible self-similar measure, then $\mu$ almost every $\mathbf{x}$ is not a singular vector.</description>

      <title>Entire maps with rational preperiodic points and multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a number field $\mathbb{K} \subset \mathbb{C}$ that is not contained in $\mathbb{R}$, we prove the existence of a dense set of entire maps $f \colon \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ whose preperiodic points and multipliers all lie in $\mathbb{K}$. This contrasts with the case of rational maps. In addition, we show that there exists an escaping quadratic-like map that is not conjugate to an affine escaping quadratic-like map and whose multipliers all lie in $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Euclidean algorithms are Gaussian over imaginary quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distributional analysis of Euclidean algorithms was carried out by Baladi and Vall\'{e}e. They showed the asymptotic normality of the number of division steps and associated costs in the Euclidean algorithm as a random variable on the set of rational numbers with bounded denominator based on the transfer operator methods. We extend their result to the Euclidean algorithm over appropriate imaginary quadratic fields by studying dynamics of the nearest integer complex continued fraction map, which is piecewise analytic and expanding but not a full branch map. By observing a finite Markov partition with a regular CW-structure, which enables us to associate the transfer operator acting on a direct sum of spaces of $C^1$-functions, we obtain the limit Gaussian distribution as well as residual equidistribution.</description>

      <title>Localized synchronous patterns in weakly coupled bistable oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by numerical continuation studies of coupled mechanical oscillators, we investigate branches of localized time-periodic solutions of one-dimensional chains of coupled oscillators. We focus on Ginzburg--Landau equations with nonlinearities of Lambda-Omega type and establish the existence of localized synchrony patterns in the case of weak coupling and weak-amplitude dependence of the oscillator periods. Depending on the coupling, localized synchrony patterns lie on a discrete stack of isola branches or on a single connected snaking branch.</description>

      <title>Topological Sequence Entropy of co-Induced Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete, countably infinite group and $H$ a subgroup of $G$. If $H$ acts continuously on a compact metric space $X$, then we can induce a continuous action of $G$ on $\prod_{H\backslash G}X$ where $H\backslash G$ is the collection of right-cosets of $H$ in $G$. This process is known as the co-induction. In this article, we will calculate the maximal pattern entropy of the co-induction. If $[G:H] &lt; +\infty$ we will show that the $H$ action is null if and only if the co-induced action of $G$ is null. Also, we will discuss an example where $H$ is a proper subgroup of $G$ with finite index where the maximal pattern entropy of the $H$ action is equal to the co-induced action of $G$. If $[G:H] = +\infty$ we will show that the maximal pattern entropy of the co-induction is always $+\infty$ given the $H$-system is not trivial.</description>

      <title>Almost Regular Closedness of the Connectedness Locus for Pairs of Affine Maps on $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the connectedness locus $\mathcal{N}$ for the family of iterated function systems of pairs of homogeneous affine-linear maps in the plane. We prove this set is regular closed (i.e., it is the closure of its interior) away from the diagonal, except possibly for isolated points, which we conjecture do not exist. We provide an overview of the "method of traps", introduced by Calegari et al. (2017), which lies at the heart of our proof.</description>

      <title>Local high-degree polynomial integrals of geodesic flows and the generalized hodograph method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Riemannian metrics on 2-surfaces with integrable geodesic flows such that an additional first integral is high-degree polynomial in momenta. This problem reduces to searching for solutions to certain quasi-linear systems of PDEs which turn out to be semi-Hamiltonian. We construct plenty of local explicit and implicit integrable examples with polynomial first integrals of degrees 3, 4, 5. Our construction is essentially based on applying the generalized hodograph method.</description>

      <title>Actuation manifold from snapshot data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven methodology to learn a low-dimensional manifold of controlled flows. The starting point is resolving snapshot flow data for a representative ensemble of actuations. Key enablers for the actuation manifold are isometric mapping as encoder and a combination of a neural network and a k-nearest-neighbour interpolation as decoder. This methodology is tested for the fluidic pinball, a cluster of three parallel cylinders perpendicular to the oncoming uniform flow. The centres of these cylinders are the vertices of an equilateral triangle pointing upstream. The flow is manipulated by constant rotation of the cylinders, i.e. described by three actuation parameters. The Reynolds number based on a cylinder diameter is chosen to be 30. The unforced flow yields statistically symmetric periodic shedding represented by a one-dimensional limit cycle. The proposed methodology yields a five-dimensional manifold describing a wide range of dynamics with small representation error. Interestingly, the manifold coordinates automatically unveil physically meaningful parameters. Two of them describe the downstream periodic vortex shedding. The other three describe the near-field actuation, i.e. the strength of boat-tailing, the Magnus effect and forward stagnation point. The manifold is shown to be a key enabler for control-oriented flow estimation.</description>
