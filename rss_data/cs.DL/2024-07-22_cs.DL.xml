      <title>OpenDataLab: Empowering General Artificial Intelligence with Open Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) hinges on the quality and accessibility of data, yet the current fragmentation and variability of data sources hinder efficient data utilization. The dispersion of data sources and diversity of data formats often lead to inefficiencies in data retrieval and processing, significantly impeding the progress of AI research and applications. To address these challenges, this paper introduces OpenDataLab, a platform designed to bridge the gap between diverse data sources and the need for unified data processing. OpenDataLab integrates a wide range of open-source AI datasets and enhances data acquisition efficiency through intelligent querying and high-speed downloading services. The platform employs a next-generation AI Data Set Description Language (DSDL), which standardizes the representation of multimodal and multi-format data, improving interoperability and reusability. Additionally, OpenDataLab optimizes data processing through tools that complement DSDL. By integrating data with unified data descriptions and smart data toolchains, OpenDataLab can improve data preparation efficiency by 30\%. We anticipate that OpenDataLab will significantly boost artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and facilitate advancements in related AI fields.

      <title>LLAssist: Simple Tools for Automating Literature Review Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces LLAssist, an open-source tool designed to streamline literature reviews in academic research. In an era of exponential growth in scientific publications, researchers face mounting challenges in efficiently processing vast volumes of literature. LLAssist addresses this issue by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automate key aspects of the review process. Specifically, it extracts important information from research articles and evaluates their relevance to user-defined research questions. The goal of LLAssist is to significantly reduce the time and effort required for comprehensive literature reviews, allowing researchers to focus more on analyzing and synthesizing information rather than on initial screening tasks. By automating parts of the literature review workflow, LLAssist aims to help researchers manage the growing volume of academic publications more efficiently.</description>

      <title>Causal foundations of bias, disparity and fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of biases, such as gender or racial biases, is an important topic in the social and behavioural sciences. However, the literature does not always clearly define the concept. Definitions of bias are often ambiguous or not provided at all. To study biases in a precise manner, it is important to have a well-defined concept of bias. We propose to define bias as a direct causal effect that is unjustified. We propose to define the closely related concept of disparity as a direct or indirect causal effect that includes a bias. Our proposed definitions can be used to study biases and disparities in a more rigorous and systematic way. We compare our definitions of bias and disparity with various criteria of fairness introduced in the artificial intelligence literature. In addition, we discuss how our definitions relate to discrimination. We illustrate our definitions of bias and disparity in two case studies, focusing on gender bias in science and racial bias in police shootings. Our proposed definitions aim to contribute to a better appreciation of the causal intricacies of studies of biases and disparities. We hope that this will also promote an improved understanding of the policy implications of such studies.</description>
