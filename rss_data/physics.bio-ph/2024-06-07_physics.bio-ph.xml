      <title>Topological phases in discrete stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants have proved useful for analyzing emergent function as they characterize a property of the entire system, and are insensitive to local details, disorder, and noise. They support edge states, which reduce the system response to a lower dimensional space and offer a mechanism for the emergence of global cycles within a large phase space. Topological invariants have been heavily studied in quantum electronic systems and been observed in other classical platforms such as mechanical lattices. However, this framework largely describes equilibrium systems within an ordered crystalline lattice, whereas biological systems are often strongly non-equilibrium with stochastic components. We review recent developments in topological states in discrete stochastic models in 1d and 2d systems, and initial progress in identifying testable signature of topological states in molecular systems and ecology. These models further provide simple principles for targeted dynamics in synthetic systems or in the engineering of reconfigurable materials. Lastly, we describe novel theoretical properties of these systems such as the necessity for non-Hermiticity in permitting edge states, as well as new analytical tools to reveal these properties. The emerging developments shed light on fundamental principles for non-equilibrium systems and topological protection enabling robust biological function.</description>

      <title>Information Benchmark for Biological Sensors Beyond Steady States -- Mpemba-like sensory withdrawal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological sensors rely on the temporal dynamics of ligand concentration for signaling. The sensory performance is bounded by the distinguishability between the sensory state transition dynamics under different environmental protocols. This work presents a comprehensive theory to characterize arbitrary transient sensory dynamics of biological sensors. Here the sensory performance is quantified by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the probability distributions of the sensor's stochastic paths. We introduce a novel benchmark to assess a sensor's transient sensory performance arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We identify a counter-intuitive phenomenon in multi-state sensors: while an initial exposure to high ligand concentration may hinder a sensor's sensitivity towards a future concentration up-shift, certain sensors may show a boost in sensitivity if the initial high concentration exposure is followed by a transient resetting at a low concentration environment. The boosted performance exceeds that of a sensor starting from an initially low concentration environment. This effect, reminiscent of a drug withdrawal effect, can be explained by the Markovian dynamics of the multi-state sensor, similar to the Markovian Mpemba effect. Moreover, an exhaustive machine learning study of 4-state sensors reveals a tight connection between the sensor's performance and the structure of the Markovian graph of its states.</description>

      <title>A topological mechanism for robust and efficient global oscillations in biological networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11503v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long and stable timescales are often observed in complex biochemical networks, such as in emergent oscillations. How these robust dynamics persist remains unclear, given the many stochastic reactions and shorter time scales demonstrated by underlying components. We propose a topological model that produces long oscillations around the network boundary, reducing the system dynamics to a lower-dimensional current in a robust manner. Using this to model KaiC, which regulates the circadian rhythm in cyanobacteria, we compare the coherence of oscillations to that in other KaiC models. Our topological model localizes currents on the system edge, with an efficient regime of simultaneously increased precision and decreased cost. Further, we introduce a new predictor of coherence from the analysis of spectral gaps, and show that our model saturates a global thermodynamic bound. Our work presents a new mechanism and parsimonious description for robust emergent oscillations in complex biological networks.</description>

      <title>A methodology of quantifying membrane permeability based on returning probability theory and molecular dynamics simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical approach to estimate the permeability coefficient of substrates (permeants) for crossing membranes from donor (D) phase to acceptor (A) phase by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A fundamental aspect of our approach involves reformulating the returning probability (RP) theory, a rigorous bimolecular reaction theory, to describe permeation phenomena. This reformulation relies on the parallelism between permeation and bimolecular reaction processes. In the present method, the permeability coefficient is represented in terms of the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities for the reactive (R) phase that exists within the inner region of membranes. One can evaluate these quantities using multiple MD trajectories starting from phase R. We apply the RP theory to the permeation of ethanol and methylamine at different concentrations (infinitely dilute and 1 mol% conditions of permeants). Under the 1 mol% condition, the present method yields a larger permeability coefficient for ethanol ($0.12 \pm 0.01 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$) than for methylamine ($0.069\pm 0.006~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$), while the values of the permeability coefficient are satisfactorily close to those obtained from the brute-force MD simulations [$0.18\pm 0.03 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ and $0.052 \pm 0.005 ~\mathrm{cm~s^{-1}}$ for ethanol and methylamine, respectively]. Moreover, upon analyzing the thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the permeability, we clarify that a higher concentration dependency of permeability for ethanol, as compared to methylamine, arises from the sensitive nature of ethanol's free-energy barrier within the inner region of the membrane against ethanol concentration.</description>
