      <title>Secure Integration of 5G in Industrial Networks: State of the Art, Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, moving away from traditional wired fieldbus networks to cutting-edge 5G mobile networks. This transition, extending from local applications to company-wide use and spanning multiple factories, is driven by the promise of low-latency communication and seamless connectivity for various devices in industrial settings. However, besides these tremendous benefits, the integration of 5G as the communication infrastructure in industrial networks introduces a new set of risks and threats to the security of industrial systems. The inherent complexity of 5G systems poses unique challenges for ensuring a secure integration, surpassing those encountered with any technology previously utilized in industrial networks. Most importantly, the distinct characteristics of industrial networks, such as real-time operation, required safety guarantees, and high availability requirements, further complicate this task. As the industrial transition from wired to wireless networks is a relatively new concept, a lack of guidance and recommendations on securely integrating 5G renders many industrial systems vulnerable and exposed to threats associated with 5G. To address this situation, in this paper, we summarize the state-of-the-art and derive a set of recommendations for the secure integration of 5G into industrial networks based on a thorough analysis of the research landscape. Furthermore, we identify opportunities to utilize 5G to further enhance security and indicate remaining challenges, potentially identifying future academic potential</description>

      <title>Cyber Risk Assessment for Cyber-Physical Systems: A Review of Methodologies and Recommendations for Improved Assessment Effectiveness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) integrate physical and embedded systems with information and communication technology systems, monitoring and controlling physical processes with minimal human intervention. The connection to information and communication technology exposes CPS to cyber risks. It is crucial to assess these risks to manage them effectively. This paper reviews scholarly contributions to cyber risk assessment for CPS, analyzing how the assessment approaches were evaluated and investigating to what extent they meet the requirements of effective risk assessment. We identify gaps limiting the effectiveness of the assessment and recommend real-time learning from cybersecurity incidents. Our review covers twenty-eight papers published between 2014 and 2023, selected based on a three-step search. Our findings show that the reviewed cyber risk assessment methodologies revealed limited effectiveness due to multiple factors. These findings provide a foundation for further research to explore and address other factors impacting the quality of cyber risk assessment in CPS.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Model of Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain with EigenTrust-Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Protocol to Manage Decentralized Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the emergence of decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) due to patient retention, accelerate trials, improve data accessibility, enable virtual care, and facilitate seamless communication through integrated systems. However, integrating systems in DCTs exposes clinical data to potential security threats, making them susceptible to theft at any stage, a high risk of protocol deviations, and monitoring issues. To mitigate these challenges, blockchain technology serves as a secure framework, acting as a decentralized ledger, creating an immutable environment by establishing a zero-trust architecture, where data are deemed untrusted until verified. In combination with Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled wearable devices, blockchain secures the transfer of clinical trial data on private blockchains during DCT automation and operations. This paper proposes a prototype model of the Zero-Trust Architecture Blockchain (z-TAB) to integrate patient-generated clinical trial data during DCT operation management. The EigenTrust-based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (T-PBFT) algorithm has been incorporated as a consensus protocol, leveraging Hyperledger Fabric. Furthermore, the Internet of Things (IoT) has been integrated to streamline data processing among stakeholders within the blockchain platforms. Rigorous evaluation has been done to evaluate the quality of the system.</description>

      <title>Manipulating OpenFlow Link Discovery Packet Forwarding for Topology Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software-defined networking (SDN) is a centralized, dynamic, and programmable network management technology that enables flexible traffic control and scalability. SDN facilitates network administration through a centralized view of the underlying physical topology; tampering with this topology view can result in catastrophic damage to network management and security. To underscore this issue, we introduce Marionette, a new topology poisoning technique that manipulates OpenFlow link discovery packet forwarding to alter topology information. Our approach exposes an overlooked yet widespread attack vector, distinguishing itself from traditional link fabrication attacks that tamper, spoof, or relay discovery packets at the data plane. Unlike localized attacks observed in existing methods, our technique introduces a globalized topology poisoning attack that leverages control privileges. Marionette implements a reinforcement learning algorithm to compute a poisoned topology target, and injects flow entries to achieve a long-lived stealthy attack. Our evaluation shows that Marionette successfully attacks five open-source controllers and nine OpenFlow-based discovery protocols. Marionette overcomes the state-of-the-art topology poisoning defenses, showcasing a new class of topology poisoning that initiates on the control plane. This security vulnerability was ethically disclosed to OpenDaylight, and CVE-2024-37018 has been assigned.</description>

      <title>Different Victims, Same Layout: Email Visual Similarity Detection for Enhanced Email Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of an effective spam detection system, the focus has often been on identifying known spam patterns either through rule-based detection systems or machine learning (ML) solutions. However, both systems are susceptible to evasion techniques and zero-day attacks that can be achieved at low cost. Therefore, an email that bypassed the defense system once can do it again in the following days, even though rules are updated or the ML models are retrained. The recurrence of failures to detect emails that exhibit layout similarities to previously undetected spam is concerning for customers and can erode their trust in a company. Our observations show that threat actors reuse email kits extensively and can bypass detection with little effort, for example, by making changes to the content of emails. In this work, we propose an email visual similarity detection approach, named Pisco, to improve the detection capabilities of an email threat defense system. We apply our proof of concept to some real-world samples received from different sources. Our results show that email kits are being reused extensively and visually similar emails are sent to our customers at various time intervals. Therefore, this method could be very helpful in situations where detection features that rely on contextual information and keywords are bypassed, an occurrence our observations show happens frequently.</description>

      <title>A Persistent Hierarchical Bloom Filter-based Framework for Authentication and Tracking of ICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting counterfeit integrated circuits (ICs) in unreliable supply chains demands robust tracking and authentication. Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) offer unique IC identifiers, but noise undermines their utility. This study introduces the Persistent Hierarchical Bloom Filter (PHBF) framework, ensuring swift and accurate IC authentication with an accuracy rate of 100% across the supply chain even with noisy PUF-generated signatures.</description>

      <title>Safety Layers of Aligned Large Language Models: The Key to LLM Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligned LLMs are highly secure, capable of recognizing and refusing to answer malicious questions. However, the role of internal parameters in maintaining this security is not well understood, further these models are vulnerable to security degradation when fine-tuned with non-malicious backdoor data or normal data. To address these challenges, our work uncovers the mechanism behind security in aligned LLMs at the parameter level, identifying a small set of contiguous layers in the middle of the model that are crucial for distinguishing malicious queries from normal ones, referred to as "safety layers." We first confirm the existence of these safety layers by analyzing variations in input vectors within the model's internal layers. Additionally, we leverage the over-rejection phenomenon and parameters scaling analysis to precisely locate the safety layers. Building on this understanding, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach, Safely Partial-Parameter Fine-Tuning (SPPFT), that fixes the gradient of the safety layers during fine-tuning to address the security degradation. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly preserves model security while maintaining performance and reducing computational resources compared to full fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>Meta-UAD: A Meta-Learning Scheme for User-level Network Traffic Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accuracy anomaly detection in user-level network traffic is crucial for network security. Compared with existing models that passively detect specific anomaly classes with large labeled training samples, user-level network traffic contains sizeable new anomaly classes with few labeled samples and has an imbalance, self-similar, and data-hungry nature. Motivation on those limitations, in this paper, we propose \textit{Meta-UAD}, a Meta-learning scheme for User-level network traffic Anomaly Detection. Meta-UAD uses the CICFlowMeter to extract 81 flow-level statistical features and remove some invalid ones using cumulative importance ranking. Meta-UAD adopts a meta-learning training structure and learns from the collection of K-way-M-shot classification tasks, which can use a pre-trained model to adapt any new class with few samples by few iteration steps. We evaluate our scheme on two public datasets. Compared with existing models, the results further demonstrate the superiority of Meta-UAD with 15{\%} - 43{\%} gains in F1-score.</description>

      <title>Colaboot: A Cloud-based Diskless PC Booting Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent increases in endpoint-based security events and threats compelled enterprise operations to switch to virtual desktop infrastructure and web-based applications. In addition to reducing potential hazards, this has guaranteed a consistent desktop environment for every user. On the other hand, the attack surface is greatly increased because all endpoints are connected to the company network, which could harbor malware and other advanced persistent threats. This results in a considerable loss of system resources on each individual endpoint. Hence our work proposes a standard called Colaboot that enables machines throughout a company to boot from a single operating system in order to address these problems and guarantee a consistent operating system environment that could be easily updated to the most recent security patches across all work stations.</description>

      <title>SPOQchain: Platform for Secure, Scalable, and Privacy-Preserving Supply Chain Tracing and Counterfeit Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product lifecycle tracing is increasingly in the focus of regulators and producers, as shown with the initiative of the Digital Product Pass. Likewise, new methods of counterfeit detection are developed that are, e.g., based on Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In order to ensure trust and integrity of product lifecycle data, multiple existing supply chain tracing systems are built on blockchain technology. However, only few solutions employ secure identifiers such as PUFs. Furthermore, existing systems that publish the data of individual products, in part fully transparently, have a detrimental impact on scalability and the privacy of users. This work proposes SPOQchain, a novel blockchain-based platform that provides comprehensive lifecycle traceability and originality verification while ensuring high efficiency and user privacy. The improved efficiency is achieved by a sophisticated batching mechanism that removes lifecycle redundancies. In addition to the successful evaluation of SPOQchain's scalability, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of privacy and security aspects, demonstrating the need and qualification of SPOQchain for the future of supply chain tracing.</description>

      <title>SIMD-Aware Homomorphic Compression and Application to Private Database Query</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a private database query scheme (PDQ), a server maintains a database, and users send queries to retrieve records of interest from the server while keeping their queries private. A crucial step in PDQ protocols based on homomorphic encryption is homomorphic compression, which compresses encrypted sparse vectors consisting of query results. In this work, we propose a new homomorphic compression scheme with PDQ as its main application. Unlike existing approaches, our scheme (i) can be efficiently implemented by fully exploiting homomorphic SIMD technique and (ii) enjoys both asymptotically optimal compression rate and asymptotically good decompression complexity. Experimental results show that our approach is 4.7x to 33.2x faster than the previous best results.</description>

      <title>Dual JPEG Compatibility: a Reliable and Explainable Tool for Image Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a JPEG pipeline (compression or decompression), this paper shows how to find the antecedent of a 8 x 8 block. If it exists, the block is compatible with the pipeline. For unaltered images, all blocks are always compatible with the original pipeline; however, for manipulated images, this is not always the case. This article demonstrates the potential of compatibility concepts for JPEG image forensics. It presents a solution to the main challenge of finding a block antecedent in a high-dimensional space. This solution relies on a local search algorithm with restrictions on the search space. We show that inpainting, copy-move, or splicing applied after a JPEG compression can be turned into three different mismatch problems and be detected. In particular, when the image is re-compressed after the modification, we can detect the manipulation if the quality factor of the second compression is higher than the first one. Our method can pinpoint forgeries down to the JPEG block with great detection power and without False Positive. We compare our method with two state-of-the-art models on localizing inpainted forgeries after a simple or a double compression. We show that under our working assumptions, it outperforms those models for most experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential increase in the number of devices connected to the internet globally has led to the requirement for the introduction of better and improved security measures for maintaining data integrity. The development of a wireless and authenticated communication system is required to overcome the safety threats and illegal access to the application system/data. The WIA-Comm System is the one that provides a bridge to control the devices at the application side. It has been designed to provide security by giving control rights only to the device whose MAC (physical) address has already been registered, so only authorized users can control the system. LoRa WAN technology has been used for wireless communication and Arduino IDE to develop the code for the required functionality.</description>

      <title>Traceable AI-driven Avatars Using Multi-factors of Physical World and Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaverse allows users to delegate their AI models to an AI engine, which builds corresponding AI-driven avatars to provide immersive experience for other users. Since current authentication methods mainly focus on human-driven avatars and ignore the traceability of AI-driven avatars, attackers may delegate the AI models of a target user to an AI proxy program to perform impersonation attacks without worrying about being detected.
  In this paper, we propose an authentication method using multi-factors to guarantee the traceability of AI-driven avatars. Firstly, we construct a user's identity model combining the manipulator's iris feature and the AI proxy's public key to ensure that an AI-driven avatar is associated with its original manipulator. Secondly, we propose a chameleon proxy signature scheme that supports the original manipulator to delegate his/her signing ability to an AI proxy. Finally, we design three authentication protocols for avatars based on the identity model and the chameleon proxy signature to guarantee the virtual-to-physical traceability including both the human-driven and AI-driven avatars.
  Security analysis shows that the proposed signature scheme is unforgeability and the authentication method is able to defend against false accusation. Extensive evaluations show that the designed authentication protocols complete user login, avatar delegation, mutual authentication, and avatar tracing in about 1s, meeting the actual application needs and helping to mitigate impersonation attacks by AI-driven avatars.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Digital Twin Technologies for Public Space Protection and Vulnerability Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the recent years, the protection of the so-called `soft-targets', i.e. locations easily accessible by the general public with relatively low, though, security measures, has emerged as a rather challenging and increasingly important issue. The complexity and seriousness of this security threat growths nowadays exponentially, due to the emergence of new advanced technologies (e.g. Artificial Intelligence (AI), Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), 3D printing, etc.); especially when it comes to large-scale, popular and diverse public spaces. In this paper, a novel Digital Twin-as-a-Security-Service (DTaaSS) architecture is introduced for holistically and significantly enhancing the protection of public spaces (e.g. metro stations, leisure sites, urban squares, etc.). The proposed framework combines a Digital Twin (DT) conceptualization with additional cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Big Data analytics and AI. In particular, DTaaSS comprises a holistic, real-time, large-scale, comprehensive and data-driven security solution for the efficient/robust protection of public spaces, supporting: a) data collection and analytics, b) area monitoring/control and proactive threat detection, c) incident/attack prediction, and d) quantitative and data-driven vulnerability assessment. Overall, the designed architecture exhibits increased potential in handling complex, hybrid and combined threats over large, critical and popular soft-targets. The applicability and robustness of DTaaSS is discussed in detail against representative and diverse real-world application scenarios, including complex attacks to: a) a metro station, b) a leisure site, and c) a cathedral square.</description>

      <title>Investigating Privacy Leakage in Dimensionality Reduction Methods via Reconstruction Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates privacy leakage in dimensionality reduction methods through a novel machine learning-based reconstruction attack. Employing an \emph{informed adversary} threat model, we develop a neural network capable of reconstructing high-dimensional data from low-dimensional embeddings.
  We evaluate six popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, sparse random projection (SRP), multidimensional scaling (MDS), Isomap, $t$-SNE, and UMAP. Using both MNIST and NIH Chest X-ray datasets, we perform a qualitative analysis to identify key factors affecting reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of an additive noise mechanism in mitigating these reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>Secure Ownership Management and Transfer of Consumer Internet of Things Devices with Self-sovereign Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven its usage in our homes and industries over the past 10-12 years. However, there have been some major issues related to identity management and ownership transfer involving IoT devices, particularly for consumer IoT devices, e. g. smart appliances such as smart TVs, smart refrigerators, and so on. There have been a few attempts to address this issue; however, user-centric and effective ownership and identity management of IoT devices have not been very successful so far. Recently, blockchain technology has been used to address these issues with limited success. This article presents a Self-sovereign Identity (SSI) based system that facilitates a secure and user-centric ownership management and transfer of consumer IoT devices. The system leverages a number of emerging technologies, such as blockchain and decentralized identifiers (DID), verifiable credentials (VC), under the umbrella of SSI. We present the architecture of the system based on a threat model and requirement analysis, discuss the implementation of a Proof-of-Concept based on the proposed system and illustrate a number of use-cases with their detailed protocol flows. Furthermore, we analyse its security using ProVerif, a state-of-the art protocol verification tool and examine its performance.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) on the ROAD dataset: A Comparative Analysis for automotive Controller Area Network (CAN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of digital devices in modern vehicles has revolutionized automotive technology, enhancing safety and the overall driving experience. The Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is a central system for managing in-vehicle communication between the electronic control units (ECUs). However, the CAN protocol poses security challenges due to inherent vulnerabilities, lacking encryption and authentication, which, combined with an expanding attack surface, necessitates robust security measures. In response to this challenge, numerous Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have been developed and deployed. Nonetheless, an open, comprehensive, and realistic dataset to test the effectiveness of such IDSs remains absent in the existing literature. This paper addresses this gap by considering the latest ROAD dataset, containing stealthy and sophisticated injections. The methodology involves dataset labelling and the implementation of both state-of-the-art deep learning models and traditional machine learning models to show the discrepancy in performance between the datasets most commonly used in the literature and the ROAD dataset, a more realistic alternative.</description>

      <title>DeTRAP: RISC-V Return Address Protection With Debug Triggers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern microcontroller software is often written in C/C++ and suffers from control-flow hijacking vulnerabilities. Previous mitigations suffer from high performance and memory overheads and require either the presence of memory protection hardware or sophisticated program analysis in the compiler.
  This paper presents DeTRAP (Debug Trigger Return Address Protection). DeTRAP utilizes a full implementation of the RISC-V debug hardware specification to provide a write-protected shadow stack for return addresses. Unlike previous work, DeTRAP requires no memory protection hardware and only minor changes to the compiler toolchain.
  We tested DeTRAP on an FPGA running a 32-bit RISC-V microcontroller core and found average execution time overheads to be between 0.5% and 1.9% on evaluated benchmark suites with code size overheads averaging 7.9% or less.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Set-Based Estimation Using Differential Privacy and Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For large-scale cyber-physical systems, the collaboration of spatially distributed sensors is often needed to perform the state estimation process. Privacy concerns arise from disclosing sensitive measurements to a cloud estimator. To solve this issue, we propose a differentially private set-based estimation protocol that guarantees true state containment in the estimated set and differential privacy for the sensitive measurements throughout the set-based state estimation process within the central and local differential privacy models. Zonotopes are employed in the proposed differentially private set-based estimator, offering computational advantages in set operations. We consider a plant of a non-linear discrete-time dynamical system with bounded modeling uncertainties, sensors that provide sensitive measurements with bounded measurement uncertainties, and a cloud estimator that predicts the system's state. The privacy-preserving noise perturbs the centers of measurement zonotopes, thereby concealing the precise position of these zonotopes, i.e., ensuring privacy preservation for the sets containing sensitive measurements. Compared to existing research, our approach achieves less privacy loss and utility loss through the central and local differential privacy models by leveraging a numerically optimized truncated noise distribution. The proposed estimator is perturbed by weaker noise than the analytical approaches in the literature to guarantee the same level of privacy, therefore improving the estimation utility. Numerical and comparison experiments with truncated Laplace noise are presented to support our approach.</description>

      <title>Further Investigation on Differential Properties of the Generalized Ness-Helleseth Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n$ be an odd positive integer, $p$ be a prime with $p\equiv3\pmod4$, $d_{1} = {{p^{n}-1}\over {2}} -1 $ and $d_{2} =p^{n}-2$. The function defined by $f_u(x)=ux^{d_{1}}+x^{d_{2}}$ is called the generalized Ness-Helleseth function over $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $u\in\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. It was initially studied by Ness and Helleseth in the ternary case. In this paper, for $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod 4$ and $p^n \ge7$, we provide the necessary and sufficient condition for $f_u(x)$ to be an APN function. In addition, for each $u$ satisfying $\chi(u+1) = \chi(u-1)$, the differential spectrum of $f_u(x)$ is investigated, and it is expressed in terms of some quadratic character sums of cubic polynomials, where $\chi(\cdot)$ denotes the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>Image-Perfect Imperfections: Safety, Bias, and Authenticity in the Shadow of Text-To-Image Model Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), undergo iterative updates to improve image quality and address concerns such as safety. Improvements in image quality are straightforward to assess. However, how model updates resolve existing concerns and whether they raise new questions remain unexplored. This study takes an initial step in investigating the evolution of text-to-image models from the perspectives of safety, bias, and authenticity. Our findings, centered on Stable Diffusion, indicate that model updates paint a mixed picture. While updates progressively reduce the generation of unsafe images, the bias issue, particularly in gender, intensifies. We also find that negative stereotypes either persist within the same Non-White race group or shift towards other Non-White race groups through SD updates, yet with minimal association of these traits with the White race group. Additionally, our evaluation reveals a new concern stemming from SD updates: State-of-the-art fake image detectors, initially trained for earlier SD versions, struggle to identify fake images generated by updated versions. We show that fine-tuning these detectors on fake images generated by updated versions achieves at least 96.6\% accuracy across various SD versions, addressing this issue. Our insights highlight the importance of continued efforts to mitigate biases and vulnerabilities in evolving text-to-image models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of cyber-security, detecting Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) remains a formidable challenge due to their stealthy and sophisticated nature. This research paper presents an innovative approach that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a 2D baseline model, enhanced by the cutting-edge Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) algorithm, to significantly improve APT detection accuracy. By seamlessly integrating the 2D-CNN baseline model with CSO, we unlock the potential for unprecedented accuracy and efficiency in APT detection. The results unveil an impressive accuracy score of $98.4\%$, marking a significant enhancement in APT detection across various attack stages, illuminating a path forward in combating these relentless and sophisticated threats.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Inference Privacy Risks Through Gradients in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In distributed learning settings, models are iteratively updated with shared gradients computed from potentially sensitive user data. While previous work has studied various privacy risks of sharing gradients, our paper aims to provide a systematic approach to analyze private information leakage from gradients. We present a unified game-based framework that encompasses a broad range of attacks including attribute, property, distributional, and user disclosures. We investigate how different uncertainties of the adversary affect their inferential power via extensive experiments on five datasets across various data modalities. Our results demonstrate the inefficacy of solely relying on data aggregation to achieve privacy against inference attacks in distributed learning. We further evaluate five types of defenses, namely, gradient pruning, signed gradient descent, adversarial perturbations, variational information bottleneck, and differential privacy, under both static and adaptive adversary settings. We provide an information-theoretic view for analyzing the effectiveness of these defenses against inference from gradients. Finally, we introduce a method for auditing attribute inference privacy, improving the empirical estimation of worst-case privacy through crafting adversarial canary records.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Correlated Rayleigh Fading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario, in which a signal is transmitted through a state-dependent wiretap channel with one legitimate receiver with which the transmitter communicates and one honest-but-curious target that the transmitter wants to sense. The secure ISAC channel is modeled as two state-dependent fast-fading channels with correlated Rayleigh fading coefficients and independent additive Gaussian noise components. Delayed channel outputs are fed back to the transmitter to improve the communication performance and to estimate the channel state sequence. We establish and illustrate an achievable secrecy-distortion region for degraded secure ISAC channels under correlated Rayleigh fading. We also evaluate the inner bound for a large set of parameters to derive practical design insights for secure ISAC methods. The presented results include in particular parameter ranges for which the secrecy capacity of a classical wiretap channel setup is surpassed and for which the channel capacity is approached.</description>

Abstract: A $\lambda$-calculus is introduced in which all programs can be evaluated in probabilistic polynomial time and in which there is sufficient structure to represent sequential cryptographic constructions and adversaries for them, even when the latter are oracle-based. A notion of observational equivalence capturing computational indistinguishability and a class of approximate logical relations are then presented, showing that the latter represent a sound proof technique for the former. The work concludes with the presentation of an example of a security proof in which the encryption scheme induced by a pseudorandom function is proven secure against active adversaries in a purely equational style.</description>

      <title>Forget to Flourish: Leveraging Machine-Unlearning on Pretrained Language Models for Privacy Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on private data for downstream applications poses significant privacy risks in potentially exposing sensitive information. Several popular community platforms now offer convenient distribution of a large variety of pre-trained models, allowing anyone to publish without rigorous verification. This scenario creates a privacy threat, as pre-trained models can be intentionally crafted to compromise the privacy of fine-tuning datasets. In this study, we introduce a novel poisoning technique that uses model-unlearning as an attack tool. This approach manipulates a pre-trained language model to increase the leakage of private data during the fine-tuning process. Our method enhances both membership inference and data extraction attacks while preserving model utility. Experimental results across different models, datasets, and fine-tuning setups demonstrate that our attacks significantly surpass baseline performance. This work serves as a cautionary note for users who download pre-trained models from unverified sources, highlighting the potential risks involved.</description>

      <title>C-RADAR: A Centralized Deep Learning System for Intrusion Detection in Software Defined Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The popularity of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) has grown in recent years, mainly because of their ability to simplify network management and improve network flexibility. However, this also makes them vulnerable to various types of cyber attacks. SDNs work on a centralized control plane which makes them more prone to network attacks. Research has demonstrated that deep learning (DL) methods can be successful in identifying intrusions in conventional networks, but their application in SDNs is still an open research area. In this research, we propose the use of DL techniques for intrusion detection in SDNs. We measure the effectiveness of our method by experimentation on a dataset of network traffic and comparing it to existing techniques. Our results show that the DL-based approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. The deep learning architecture that has been used in this research is a Long Short Term Memory Network and Self-Attention based architecture i.e. LSTM-Attn which achieves an Fl-score of 0.9721. Furthermore, this technique can be trained to detect new attack patterns and improve the overall security of SDNs.</description>

      <title>Split Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We for the first time propose, implement, and evaluate a practical Split Unlearning framework by enabling SISA-based machine unlearning (SP'21) in Split Learning (SL).
  We introduce SplitWiper and SplitWiper+, which leverage the inherent "Sharded" structure of SL and address the issues where existing SL methods compromise the "Isolated" principle of SISA due to the tight coupling between clients and the server. This coupling involves frequent bidirectional data flows and iterative training across all clients. We resolve these challenges by designing a new one-way-one-off propagation scheme. Our design decouples the propagation of neural signals between clients and between clients and the server, enabling SISA-based unlearning in SplitWiper, even with absent clients. SplitWiper+ further enhances client label privacy against the server under this scheme by using differential privacy. Our extensive experiments across diverse data distributions and tasks demonstrate that SplitWiper, which involves only the requesting clients, achieves 0% unlearning accuracy and is over 108% more effective in retaining accuracy than existing SL methods, while maintaining constant overhead through its one-way-one-off propagation, reducing computational and communication costs by over 99%. SplitWiper+ preserves over 90% of label privacy when sharing masked labels with servers.</description>

Abstract: Physical side-channel attacks can compromise the security of integrated circuits. Most physical side-channel attacks (e.g., power or electromagnetic) exploit the dynamic behavior of a chip, typically manifesting as changes in current consumption or voltage fluctuations where algorithmic countermeasures, such as masking, can effectively mitigate them. However, as demonstrated recently, these mitigation techniques are not entirely effective against backscattered side-channel attacks such as impedance analysis. In the case of an impedance attack, an adversary exploits the data-dependent impedance variations of the chip power delivery network (PDN) to extract secret information. In this work, we introduce RandOhm, which exploits a moving target defense (MTD) strategy based on the partial reconfiguration (PR) feature of mainstream FPGAs and programmable SoCs to defend against impedance side-channel attacks. We demonstrate that the information leakage through the PDN impedance could be significantly reduced via runtime reconfiguration of the secret-sensitive parts of the circuitry. Hence, by constantly randomizing the placement and routing of the circuit, one can decorrelate the data-dependent computation from the impedance value. Moreover, in contrast to existing PR-based countermeasures, RandOhm deploys open-source bitstream manipulation tools on programmable SoCs to speed up the randomization and provide real-time protection. To validate our claims, we apply RandOhm to AES ciphers realized on 28-nm FPGAs. We analyze the resiliency of our approach by performing non-profiled and profiled impedance analysis attacks and investigate the overhead of our mitigation in terms of delay and performance.</description>

      <title>A Deep-Learning Technique to Locate Cryptographic Operations in Side-Channel Traces</title>

Abstract: Side-channel attacks allow extracting secret information from the execution of cryptographic primitives by correlating the partially known computed data and the measured side-channel signal. However, to set up a successful side-channel attack, the attacker has to perform i) the challenging task of locating the time instant in which the target cryptographic primitive is executed inside a side-channel trace and then ii)the time-alignment of the measured data on that time instant. This paper presents a novel deep-learning technique to locate the time instant in which the target computed cryptographic operations are executed in the side-channel trace. In contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, the proposed methodology works even in the presence of trace deformations obtained through random delay insertion techniques. We validated our proposal through a successful attack against a variety of unprotected and protected cryptographic primitives that have been executed on an FPGA-implemented system-on-chip featuring a RISC-V CPU.</description>

      <title>Almost Instance-optimal Clipping for Summation Problems in the Shuffle Model of Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially private mechanisms achieving worst-case optimal error bounds (e.g., the classical Laplace mechanism) are well-studied in the literature. However, when typical data are far from the worst case, \emph{instance-specific} error bounds -- which depend on the largest value in the dataset -- are more meaningful. For example, consider the sum estimation problem, where each user has an integer $x_i$ from the domain $\{0,1,\dots,U\}$ and we wish to estimate $\sum_i x_i$. This has a worst-case optimal error of $O(U/\varepsilon)$, while recent work has shown that the clipping mechanism can achieve an instance-optimal error of $O(\max_i x_i \cdot \log\log U /\varepsilon)$. Under the shuffle model, known instance-optimal protocols are less communication-efficient. The clipping mechanism also works in the shuffle model, but requires two rounds: Round one finds the clipping threshold, and round two does the clipping and computes the noisy sum of the clipped data. In this paper, we show how these two seemingly sequential steps can be done simultaneously in one round using just $1+o(1)$ messages per user, while maintaining the instance-optimal error bound. We also extend our technique to the high-dimensional sum estimation problem and sparse vector aggregation (a.k.a. frequency estimation under user-level differential privacy).</description>

      <title>LaserEscape: Detecting and Mitigating Optical Probing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The security of integrated circuits (ICs) can be broken by sophisticated physical attacks relying on failure analysis methods. Optical probing is one of the most prominent examples of such attacks, which can be accomplished in a matter of days, even with limited knowledge of the IC under attack. Unfortunately, few countermeasures are proposed in the literature, and none has been fabricated and tested in practice. These countermeasures usually require changing the standard cell libraries and, thus, are incompatible with digital and programmable platforms, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). In this work, we shift our attention from preventing the attack to detecting and responding to it. We introduce LaserEscape, the first fully digital and FPGA-compatible countermeasure to detect and mitigate optical probing attacks. LaserEscape incorporates digital delay-based sensors to reliably detect the physical alteration on the fabric caused by laser beam irradiations in real time. Furthermore, as a response to the attack, LaserEscape deploys real-time hiding approaches using randomized hardware reconfigurability. It realizes 1) moving target defense (MTD) to physically move the sensitive circuity under attack out of the probing field of focus to protect secret keys and 2) polymorphism to logically obfuscate the functionality of the targeted circuit to counter function extraction and reverse engineering attempts. We demonstrate the effectiveness and resiliency of our approach by performing optical probing attacks on protected and unprotected designs on a 28-nm FPGA. Our results show that optical probing attacks can be reliably detected and mitigated without interrupting the chip's operation.</description>

      <title>Threat-Informed Cyber Resilience Index: A Probabilistic Quantitative Approach to Measure Defence Effectiveness Against Cyber Attacks</title>

Abstract: In the dynamic cyber threat landscape, effective decision-making under uncertainty is crucial for maintaining robust information security. This paper introduces the Cyber Resilience Index (CRI), a threat-informed probabilistic approach to quantifying an organisation's defence effectiveness against cyber-attacks (campaigns). Building upon the Threat-Intelligence Based Security Assessment (TIBSA) methodology, we present a mathematical model that translates complex threat intelligence into an actionable, unified metric similar to a stock market index, that executives can understand and interact with while teams can act upon. Our method leverages Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to simulate attacker behaviour considering real-world uncertainties and the latest threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This allows for dynamic, context-aware evaluation of an organization's security posture, moving beyond static compliance-based assessments. As a result, decision-makers are equipped with a single metric of cyber resilience that bridges the gap between quantitative and qualitative assessments, enabling data-driven resource allocation and strategic planning. This can ultimately lead to more informed decision-making, mitigate under or overspending, and assist in resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses Against Large Language Models: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have performed exceptionally in various text-generative tasks, including question answering, translation, code completion, etc. However, the over-assistance of LLMs has raised the challenge of "jailbreaking", which induces the model to generate malicious responses against the usage policy and society by designing adversarial prompts. With the emergence of jailbreak attack methods exploiting different vulnerabilities in LLMs, the corresponding safety alignment measures are also evolving. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy of jailbreak attack and defense methods. For instance, the attack methods are divided into black-box and white-box attacks based on the transparency of the target model. Meanwhile, we classify defense methods into prompt-level and model-level defenses. Additionally, we further subdivide these attack and defense methods into distinct sub-classes and present a coherent diagram illustrating their relationships. We also conduct an investigation into the current evaluation methods and compare them from different perspectives. Our findings aim to inspire future research and practical implementations in safeguarding LLMs against adversarial attacks. Above all, although jailbreak remains a significant concern within the community, we believe that our work enhances the understanding of this domain and provides a foundation for developing more secure LLMs.</description>

      <title>Scalable Optimization for Locally Relevant Geo-Location Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Geo-obfuscation functions as a location privacy protection mechanism (LPPM), enabling mobile users to share obfuscated locations with servers instead of their exact locations. This technique protects users' location privacy during server-side data breaches since the obfuscation process is irreversible. To minimize the utility loss caused by data obfuscation, linear programming (LP) is widely used. However, LP can face a polynomial explosion in decision variables, making it impractical for large-scale geo-obfuscation applications. In this paper, we propose a new LPPM called Locally Relevant Geo-obfuscation (LR-Geo) to optimize geo-obfuscation using LP more efficiently. This is accomplished by restricting the geo-obfuscation calculations for each user to locally relevant (LR) locations near the user's actual location. To prevent LR locations from inadvertently revealing a user's true whereabouts, users compute the LP coefficients locally and upload only these coefficients to the server, rather than the LR locations themselves. The server then solves the LP problem using the provided coefficients. Additionally, we enhance the LP framework with an exponential obfuscation mechanism to ensure that the obfuscation distribution is indistinguishable across multiple users. By leveraging the constraint structure of the LP formulation, we apply Benders' decomposition to further boost computational efficiency. Our theoretical analysis confirms that, even though geo-obfuscation is calculated independently for each user, it still adheres to geo-indistinguishability constraints across multiple users with high probability. Finally, experimental results using a real-world dataset demonstrate that LR-Geo outperforms existing geo-obfuscation methods in terms of computational time, data utility, and privacy protection.</description>

      <title>ARINC 429 Cyber-vulnerabilities and Voltage Data in a Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ARINC 429 is a ubiquitous data bus for civil avionics, enabling reliable communication between devices from disparate manufacturers. However, ARINC 429 lacks any form of encryption or authentication, making it an inherently insecure communication protocol and rendering any connected avionics vulnerable to a range of attacks. We constructed a hardware-in-the-loop simulator with ARINC 429 buses, explored these vulnerabilities, and identified their potential to deny, degrade, or disrupt aircraft capabilities. We performed a denial-of-service attack against a multi-function display via a compromised ARINC 429 bus using commercially available tools, which succeeded in disabling important navigational aids. This proven attack on physical avionics illustrates the risk inherent in ARINC 429 and the need for the ability to detect these attacks. One potential mitigation is an intrusion detection system (IDS) trained on data collected from the electrical properties of the physical bus. Although previous research has demonstrated the feasibility of an IDS on an ARINC 429 bus, no IDS has been trained on data generated by avionics hardware. To facilitate this, we recorded voltage traces and message history generated by avionics and adversarial devices on the ARINC 429 bus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available collection of hardware-generated ARINC 429 signal data.</description>
