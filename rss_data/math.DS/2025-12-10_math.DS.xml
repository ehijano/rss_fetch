      <title>Normal forms in a neighborhood of hyperbolic periodic orbits for flows in dimension 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a neighborhood of a hyperbolic periodic orbit of a volume-preserving flow on a manifold of dimension 3, we define and show the existence of a normal form for the generator of the flow that encodes the dynamics. If the flow is a contact flow, we show the existence of a normal form for the contact form what results in an improved normal form for its Reeb vector field. Additionally, we present a few rigidity results associated to periodic data for Anosov contact flows derived from the underlying normal form theory. Finally, we establish a new local rigidity result for contact flows on manifolds of dimension 3 in a neighborhood of a hyperbolic periodic point by finding a new link between the roof function and the return map to a section.</description>

      <title>M\"obius Transformations and the Analytic--Geometric Reconstruction of the Induction--Machine Circle Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heyland circle diagram is a classical graphical method for representing the steady--state behavior of induction machines using no--load and blocked--rotor test data. Despite its long pedagogical history, the traditional geometric construction has not been formalized within a closed analytic framework. This note develops a complete Euclidean reconstruction of the diagram using only the two measured phasors and elementary geometric operations, yielding a unique circle, a torque chord, a slip scale, and a maximum--torque point. We prove that this constructed circle coincides precisely with the analytic steady--state current locus obtained from the per--phase equivalent circuit. A M\"obius transformation interpretation reveals the complex--analytic origin of the diagram's circularity and offers a compact explanation of its geometric structure.</description>

      <title>Weak disjointness of hypercyclic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weak disjointness of hypercyclic operators to advance the classifications of hypercyclic operators. We establish an analogue of the Weiss-Akin-Glasner Theorem from topological dynamics within the framework of linear dynamics, which gives a characterization of the weak disjointness of each class of mixing operators with respect to a given Furstenberg family. The key ingredient is the analogues of Weiss-Akin-Glasner Lemma from topological dynamics, which gives a characterization of subsets of non-negative integers which can be realized by the return time sets of mixing operators with respect to a given Furstenberg family. We also provide several examples to distinguish some classes of hypercyclic operators and end with the characterization of the weak disjointness of backward shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces.</description>

      <title>A conceptual model for growth by Capital-Education investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic growth depends on capital investments and on investments in education and innovation. The model introduced here will specifiy aggregate output as determined by aggregate supply of capital and education investment. After formulating and analysing such a model in section 2 we will consider the effectiveness of education for the growth of the National Product. It turns out that small changes of the quality of education has a considerable impact on economic growth. Secondly we consider the influence of chaotic fluctuations of capital investments caused by hype-cycles or erratic policies. In section 3 we introduce a continuous control on education investments depending on consumption. In this 3-dimensional macro-economic model it turns out that a tipping point exists where increase of consumption affecting the amount of education and innovation leads to decline of economic growth.</description>

      <title>L-shadowing for the induced hyperspace homeomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a homeomorphism f of a compact metric space X satisfies the L-shadowing property if and only if its induced hyperspace homeomorphism also satisfies the L-shadowing property. In the proof, assuming only the L-shadowing property, we obtain the existence of points in the asymptotic local-product-structure with iterates approaching in a uniform rate of convergence to zero. This contrasts with the lack of uniformity of contraction on local stable/unstable sets on many homeomorphisms with the L-shadowing property.</description>

      <title>Multifractal Analysis of Equilibrium States of Endomorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a holomorphic endomorphism of $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^k$ of algebraic degree at least $2$ and let $X \subseteq \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^k$ be an uniformly expanding set. In this paper, we study multifractal analysis of equilibrium states of H\"older continuous functions for the non-conformal dynamical system $f : X \to X$. In lieu of Hausdorff dimensions, we use a new dimension theory (i.e., the volume dimension theory) to define various local dimension multifractal spectra and show that each of these spectra form a Legendre transform pair with the temperature function as in the conformal case. As an application of our main theorems, we also prove a conditional variational principle for such dimension multifractal spectra.</description>

      <title>Conditional traffic-like rules for particle-flow simulation in cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to the description and understanding of two-dimensional binary cellular automata with the Moore neighborhood that preserve the number of active cells. Such dynamical systems are known to successfully capture particle dynamics and are often used as theoretical models of physical processes where some conservation laws have to be taken into account. Unfortunately, to date, there are no tools for designing such non-trivial cellular automata or for studying their properties, not to mention finding them all and describing their dynamics (even the order of magnitude of their number is unknown). We believe that the novel framework unfolded in this paper will make it possible to overcome all these challenges.</description>

      <title>Dynamics on Hyperspace of Pointwise Periodic Homeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the dynamics of induced map $2^f$ of a given pointwise periodic homeomorphism $f:X\to X$ of a compact metric space $X$. First, we show that the topological entropy of $2^f$ is zero, i.e. $h_{top}(2^f)=0$ and that the set of almost periodic points coincides with the set of uniformly recurrent points, i.e. $AP(2^f)=UR(2^f)$. Furthermore, we prove that inside any infinite $\omega$-limit set $\omega_{2^f}(A)$ there is a unique minimal set and this minimal set is an adding machine. As a consequence, $(2^X,2^f)$ has no Devaney chaotic subsystems. In contrast to these rigidity properties, we obtain some results with chaotic flavor. In fact, we prove the following dichotomy, the hyperspace system $(2^X,2^f)$ is either equicontinuous or choatic with respect to Li-Yorke chaos and $\omega$-chaos. It is shown that the later case occurs if and only if $R(2^f)\setminus AP(2^f)\neq\emptyset$. This enables us to provide simple examples of pointwise periodic homeomorphisms with chaotic induced systems.</description>

      <title>State and Parameter Estimation for a Neural Model of Local Field Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of cortical dynamics during different states such as decision making, sleep and movement, is an important topic in Neuroscience. Modelling efforts aim to relate the neural rhythms present in cortical recordings to the underlying dynamics responsible for their emergence. We present an effort to characterize the neural activity from the cortex of a mouse during natural sleep, captured through local field potential measurements. Our approach relies on using a discretized Wilson--Cowan Amari neural field model for neural activity, along with a data assimilation method that allows the Bayesian joint estimation of the state and parameters. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on synthetic measurements before applying it to a dataset available in literature. Our findings suggest the potential of our approach to characterize the stimulus received by the cortex from other brain regions, while simultaneously inferring a state that aligns with the observed signal.</description>

      <title>Normal form computation of nonlinear dispersion relationship for locally resonant metamaterial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the application of the parametrisation method for invariant manifold with a complex normal form style (CNF), for the derivation of high-order approximations of underdamped nonlinear dispersion relationships for periodic structures, more specifically by considering the case of a locally resonant metamaterial chain incorporating damping and various nonlinear stiffnesses. Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of population level approximation of network processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The individual-based model of simple contagion processes is considered on regular graphs. This model explicitly incorporates the adjacency matrix of the network enabling us to study the effect of network structure on the dynamic of the propagation process. While the asymptotic behaviour of the model is well known, the transient behaviour has been less studied. Our goal in this paper is to give a theoretical estimate on the accuracy of the one-dimensional population-level approximation. This is carried out for arbitrary simple contagion processes and regular Tur\'an graphs. Numerical evidence is shown that the theoretical estimate is rather sharp for dense graphs.</description>

      <title>Flow-Based Modelling of Population Dynamics with Consecutive Continuous Mutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a continuous mathematical model of population dynamics that describes the sequential emergence of new genotypes under limited resources. The framework models genotype density as a nonlinear flow in mutation space, combining transport driven by a time-dependent mutation rate with logistic growth and nonlocal competition. For the advection-reaction regime without reverse mutations, we derive analytical solutions using the method of characteristics and obtain explicit expressions for time-varying carrying capacities and mutation velocities. We analyze how decaying and accelerating mutation rates shape the saturation and propagation of population fronts through level-set geometry. When reverse mutations are included, the system becomes a quasilinear parabolic equation with diffusion in genotype space; numerical experiments show that backward mutation flows stabilize the dynamics and smooth the evolving fronts. The proposed model generalizes classical quasispecies and Crow-Kimura formulations by incorporating logistic regulation, variable mutation rates, and reversible transitions, offering a unified approach to evolutionary processes relevant to virology, bacterial adaptation, and tumor progression.</description>

      <title>Siegel-Veech Constants for Cyclic Covers of Generic Translation Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the asymptotic number of cylinders, weighted by their area to any non-negative power, on any cyclic branched cover of any generic translation surface in any stratum. Our formulas depend only on topological invariants of the cover and number-theoretic properties of the degree: in particular, the ratio of the related Siegel-Veech constants for the locus of covers and for the base stratum component is independent of the number of branch values. One surprising corollary is that this ratio for $area^3$ Siegel-Veech constants is always equal to the reciprocal of the degree of the cover. A key ingredient is a classification of the connected components of certain loci of cyclic branched covers.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns of the form
  $$ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}} + n^{1/2}\rfloor).$$
  Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences.
  We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we obtain new simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, a crucial ingredient to deal with the aforementioned classes of Hardy sequences.</description>

Abstract: We prove the transitivity of real Anosov diffeomorphisms, which are Anosov diffeomorphisms where stable and unstable spaces decompose into a continuous sum of invariant one-dimensional sub-spaces with uniform contraction/expansion over the ambient manifold. We prove that if a stable/unstable curve has a well-defined length in a conformal hyperbolic distance, then it has a globally defined holonomy. We exhibit a conformal hyperbolic distance with well-defined length of stable/unstable curves for each real Anosov diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics in a reaction-diffusion competition model with edge behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a two-species competition model in a landscape consisting of a finite number of adjacent patches. For the two-patch scenario, by treating edge behavior at the interface as a strategy, it has been shown that there exists an ideal free distribution (IFD) strategy, which is a globally evolutionarily stable strategy. Specifically, when the resident species follows the IFD strategy and the mutant species does not, the mutant species is unable to invade the resident population. Building on this foundation, our work focuses on exploring the dynamics of the system when neither species can adopt the IFD strategy. We demonstrate that if the strategies of both species either exceed or fall below the IFD strategy, the mutant species can outcompete and eliminate the resident species, provided that its strategy is closer to the IFD strategy and its diffusion rates are equal to or slower than those of the resident species. Furthermore, if the strategies of the two species lie on opposite sides of the IFD strategy, the two species can coexist. This result is further extended to the case of an arbitrary but finite number of patches.</description>

      <title>Detecting ideals in reduced crossed product C*-algebras of topological dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the $\ell^1$-ideal intersection property for crossed product C*-algebras. It is implied by C*-simplicity as well as C*-uniqueness. We show that topological dynamical systems of arbitrary lattices in connected Lie groups, arbitrary linear groups over the integers in a number field and arbitrary virtually polycyclic groups have the $\ell^1$-ideal intersection property. On the way, we extend previous results on C*-uniqueness of $\mathrm{L}^1$-groupoid algebras to the general twisted setting.</description>

      <title>A connection between Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants for groups of homeomorphisms of the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an obstruction for groups with Relative Property (T) to act on the real line by bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms. This condition is expressed in terms of the Lipschitz and Kazhdan constants associated to finite generating subsets. As an application, we obtain an explicit lower bound for the Lipschitz constants associated to actions of the semidirect product $\mathbb{F}_2\ltimes\mathbb{Z}^2$. We also obtain an upper bound for the Kazhdan constants of pairs of orderable groups, depending only on the cardinal of the generating subset.</description>

      <title>Approaches to critical point theory via sequential and parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01980v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of a space was introduced to obtain a lower bound on the number of critical points of a $C^1$-function on a given manifold. Related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category and motivated by topological robotics, the topological complexity (TC) of a space is a numerical homotopy invariant whose topological properties are an active field of research. The notions of sequential and parametrized topological complexity extend the ideas of topological complexity. While the definition of TC is closely related to Lusternik-Schnirelmann category, the connections of sequential and parametrized TC to critical point theory have not been fully explored yet. In this article we apply methods from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory to establish various lower bounds on numbers of critical points of functions in terms of sequential and parametrized TCs. We carry out several consequences and applications of these bounds, among them a computation of the parametrized TC of the unit tangent bundles of $(4m-1)$-spheres.</description>

      <title>Conley-Zehnder Indices of Spatial Rotating Kepler Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study periodic orbits in the spatial rotating Kepler problem from a symplectic-topological perspective. Our first main result provides a complete classification of these orbits via a natural parametrization of the space of Kepler orbits, using angular momentum and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. We then compute the Conley-Zehnder indices of non-degenerate orbits and the Robbin-Salamon indices of degenerate families, establishing their contributions to symplectic homology via the Morse-Bott spectral sequence. To address coordinate degeneracies in the spatial setting, we introduce a new coordinate system based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. These results offer a full symplectic-topological profile of the three-dimensional rotating Kepler problem and connect it to generators of symplectic homology.</description>

      <title>The Mean-Field Dynamics of Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>
