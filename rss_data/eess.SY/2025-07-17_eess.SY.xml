      <title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Multi-objective Transmission Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission switching is a well-established approach primarily applied to minimize operational costs through strategic network reconfiguration. However, exclusive focus on cost reduction can compromise system reliability. While multi-objective transmission switching can balance cost savings with reliability improvements, feasible solutions become exceedingly difficult to obtain as system scale grows, due to the inherent nonlinearity and high computational demands involved. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method for multi-objective transmission switching. The method incorporates a dueling-based actor-critic framework to evaluate the relative impact of each line switching decision within the action space, which improves decision quality and enhances both system reliability and cost efficiency. Numerical studies on the IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach compared to two benchmark DRL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Battery Systems for Enhanced Fast Charging in Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is rapidly growing as a key solution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, prolonged charging times remain a significant barrier to widespread EV usage, especially for individuals without access to fast charging infrastructure. This paper explores the potential of reconfigurable battery systems to reduce EV charging times without compromising battery life. We propose innovative battery pack configurations that dynamically adjust the arrangement of cells to optimize charging performance. Simulations were conducted using MATLAB and Simulink to compare the efficiency of various battery configurations, focusing on charging times, state of charge (SOC), voltage, and current under different conditions. The results demonstrate that connecting more batteries in series through reconfigurability in battery packs can significantly reduce charging times while maintaining operational safety. This study offers insights into how reconfigurable battery designs can provide a practical solution for faster, more efficient home-based EV charging, making EV ownership more accessible and sustainable.</description>

      <title>Mobility Extraction and Analysis of GaN HEMTs for RF Applications Using TCAD and Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) using both TCAD simulation and experimental characterization. The energy band structure was studied using Nextnano simulation software to observe two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) formation and carrier confinement under equilibrium conditions. Additionally, I-V and C-V data from fabricated research-grade GaN HEMTs were analyzed to extract key electrical parameters. The device demonstrated an ON current of 1.9 mA and an OFF current of 0.01 mA, indicating a strong ON/OFF current ratio. A subthreshold swing of 80 mV/decade and a DIBL of 5 mV/V were observed, confirming good gate control and short-channel suppression. The ON-resistance was 22.72 ohm per micron, with a saturation voltage of 1 V . The peak transconductance was extracted as 0.18 mS in the linear region and 0.5 mS in saturation. Field-effect mobility was calculated using the transconductance method, with a maximum value of approximately 1200 cm2/V.s at low drain bias. The combined simulation and experimental approach provided comprehensive insight into GaN HEMT behavior, enabling a deeper understanding of structure-performance relationships critical to advanced transistor design.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Design and Comparative Test of Natural Gradient Gaussian Approximation Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular Bayes filters typically rely on linearization techniques such as Taylor series expansion and stochastic linear regression to use the structure of standard Kalman filter. These techniques may introduce large estimation errors in nonlinear and non-Gaussian systems. This paper overviews a recent breakthrough in filtering algorithm design called \textit{N}atural Gr\textit{a}dient Gaussia\textit{n} Appr\textit{o}ximation (NANO) filter and compare its performance over a large class of nonlinear filters. The NANO filter interprets Bayesian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization problems, which allows to define optimal Gaussian approximation and derive its corresponding extremum conditions. The algorithm design still follows the two-step structure of Bayes filters. In the prediction step, NANO filter calculates the first two moments of the prior distribution, and this process is equivalent to a moment-matching filter. In the update step, natural gradient descent is employed to directly minimize the objective of the update step, thereby avoiding errors caused by model linearization. Comparative tests are conducted on four classic systems, including the damped linear oscillator, sequence forecasting, modified growth model, and robot localization, under Gaussian, Laplace, and Beta noise to evaluate the NANO filter's capability in handling nonlinearity. Additionally, we validate the NANO filter's robustness to data outliers using a satellite attitude estimation example. It is observed that the NANO filter outperforms popular Kalman filters family such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF) and posterior linearization filter (PLF), while having similar computational burden.</description>

      <title>Advantages of Feedback in Distributed Data-Gathering for Accurate and Power-Efficient State-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed target-tracking sensor networks, efficient data gathering methods are necessary to save communication resources and assure information accuracy. This paper proposes a Feedback (FB) distributed data-gathering method which lets the central unit feed information back to the mobile sensors; each sensor then uses it to cancel redundant transmissions and reduce communication congestion. We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared error (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional Non-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and advantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication delay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period, observation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain achieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region is nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends more on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the sensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete conditions under which these outcomes hold. Using extensive numerical simulations under a variety of settings, we confirm the accuracy of the derived conditions, and show that our theoretical results hold even for more complex scenarios where the simplifying assumptions no longer hold.</description>

      <title>Towards Ultra-Reliable 6G in-X Subnetworks: Dynamic Link Adaptation by Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G networks are composed of subnetworks expected to meet ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for mission-critical applications such as industrial control and automation. An often-ignored aspect in URLLC is consecutive packet outages, which can destabilize control loops and compromise safety in in-factory environments. Hence, the current work proposes a link adaptation framework to support extreme reliability requirements using the soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm that jointly optimizes energy efficiency (EE) and reliability under dynamic channel and interference conditions. Unlike prior work focusing on average reliability, our method explicitly targets reducing burst/consecutive outages through adaptive control of transmit power and blocklength based solely on the observed signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The joint optimization problem is formulated under finite blocklength and quality of service constraints, balancing reliability and EE. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms, reducing outage bursts while consuming only 18\% of the transmission cost required by a full/maximum resource allocation policy in the evaluated scenario. The framework also supports flexible trade-off tuning between EE and reliability by adjusting reward weights, making it adaptable to diverse industrial requirements.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resilient State Estimation and Control with Strategically Implemented Security Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of distributed resilient state estimation and control for linear time-invariant systems in the presence of malicious false data injection sensor attacks and bounded noise. We consider a system operator (defender) capable of deploying cybersecurity measures to counteract the sensor compromises. Although such measures enhance resilience against adversarial attacks, they may incur substantial costs; hence, it is crucial to select countermeasures to balance resilience gains and cost efficiency strategically. We first demonstrate that the system's resilience against attacks is maximized through the appropriate implementation of security measures, implying that no attacker can execute undetectable sensor attacks. Building on this analysis, we propose an algorithm that identifies the optimal security measure. While determining this measure is NP-hard in general, we also derive sufficient conditions under which efficient computation is feasible. Furthermore, we develop a distributed resilient state estimation and control scheme informed by the optimal security measure and establish conditions that guarantee bounded estimation and control errors. Finally, we validate the efficacy of our approach via numerical simulations of a vehicle platooning scenario.</description>

      <title>Inductance Estimation for High-Power Multilayer Rectangle Planar Windings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple and accurate monomial-like equation for estimating the inductance of Multilayer Rectangle-shaped Planar Windings (MLRPWs) for high-frequency, high-power applications. The equation consists of the power product of the geometrical dimensions, raised at individual power coefficients. The coefficients are generated via Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), based on a large set of approximately 6,000 simulated windings, with an 80/20 training/evaluation sample ratio. The resulting mean error value is 0%, with a standard deviation below 1.8%. The accuracy of the inductance estimation is confirmed on several experimental samples, with dimensions both within and outside the initial training dataset.</description>

      <title>Integrated Switched Capacitor Array and Synchronous Charge Extraction with Adaptive Hybrid MPPT for Piezoelectric Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy Harvesting technologies will play a fundamental role in the development of the next generation of electronic systems as well as in advancing the development of sustainable infrastructure. One of the critical challenges in EH is utilizing ambient vibrations to harvest energy. Piezo Energy Harvesting, which uses ambient vibrations, is a promising technology in energy harvesting and a self-powered technology. However, it suffers from several practical challenges. Some of these challenges include narrow bandwidth, non-linearity, and impedance mismatch, among others. This paper presents a novel, simulated Piezo Energy Harvesting (PEH) framework that addresses some of these challenges. The proposed model is designed to be adaptive and effective against the inherent non-linearity of PEH. This detailed model covers a non-linear piezo, Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction (SECE), Hybrid Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a Switched Capacitor Array (SCA). The SECE extracts the maximum charge accumulated on the piezo every time the piezo reaches the mechanical extremum. The Bouc-Wen model has been used to establish nonlinearity in the system. The hybrid MPPT exhibits significant improvement over conventional P&amp;O, while the SCA-tuned system demonstrates resilience against variable frequency input.</description>

      <title>Learning, fast and slow: a two-fold algorithm for data-based model adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the challenge of adapting data-based models over time. We propose a novel two-fold modelling architecture designed to correct plant-model mismatch caused by two types of uncertainty. Out-of-domain uncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in the initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from real-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To handle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the human brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored operating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems it necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a combination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical proximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and (ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises the ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of a new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain uncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast thinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the slow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP) model, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding older samples. The proposed methodology is tested on a benchmark energy system referenced in the literature, demonstrating that the combined use of slow and fast learning components improves model accuracy compared to standard adaptation approaches.</description>

      <title>Neural Co-state Regulator: A Data-Driven Paradigm for Real-time Optimal Control with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel unsupervised learning framework for solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs) with input constraints in real-time. In this framework, a neural network (NN) learns to predict the optimal co-state trajectory that minimizes the control Hamiltonian for a given system, at any system's state, based on the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). Specifically, the NN is trained to find the norm-optimal co-state solution that simultaneously satisfies the nonlinear system dynamics and minimizes a quadratic regulation cost. The control input is then extracted from the predicted optimal co-state trajectory by solving a quadratic program (QP) to satisfy input constraints and optimality conditions. We coin the term neural co-state regulator (NCR) to describe the combination of the co-state NN and control input QP solver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the NCR, we compare its feedback control performance with that of an expert nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) solver on a unicycle model. Because the NCR's training does not rely on expert nonlinear control solvers which are often suboptimal, the NCR is able to produce solutions that outperform the nonlinear MPC solver in terms of convergence error and input trajectory smoothness even for system conditions that are outside its original training domain. At the same time, the NCR offers two orders of magnitude less computational time than the nonlinear MPC.</description>

      <title>Mixed-integer Second-Order Cone Programming for Multi-period Scheduling of Flexible AC Transmission System Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable sources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads, losses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their capacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS) devices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the efficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of key FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model integrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for voltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv) thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and flow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited number of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at all times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the model employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific constraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt reactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power bounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A multi-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making, ensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE 9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce losses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring robustness in the presence of system perturbations for symbolic control techniques. Given a discrete-time control system that is related to its symbolic model by an alternating simulation relation. In this paper, we focus on computing the maximum robustness margin under which the symbolic model remains valid for a perturbed-version of the discrete-time control system. We first show that symbolic models are inherently equipped with a certain free robustness margins. We then provide constructive procedures to compute uniform and non-uniform (state and input dependent) robustness margins. We also show that the tightness of the robustness margin depends on the tightness of the reachability technique used to compute the symbolic model. We then explain how the computed robustness margin can be used for the sake of controller synthesis. Finally, we present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>BitWave: Exploiting Column-Based Bit-Level Sparsity for Deep Learning Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bit-serial computation facilitates bit-wise sequential data processing, offering numerous benefits, such as a reduced area footprint and dynamically-adaptive computational precision. It has emerged as a prominent approach, particularly in leveraging bit-level sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, existing bit-serial accelerators exploit bit-level sparsity to reduce computations by skipping zero bits, but they suffer from inefficient memory accesses due to the irregular indices of the non-zero bits.
  As memory accesses typically are the dominant contributor to DNN accelerator performance, this paper introduces a novel computing approach called "bit-column-serial" and a compatible architecture design named "BitWave." BitWave harnesses the advantages of the "bit-column-serial" approach, leveraging structured bit-level sparsity in combination with dynamic dataflow techniques. This achieves a reduction in computations and memory footprints through redundant computation skipping and weight compression. BitWave is able to mitigate the performance drop or the need for retraining that is typically associated with sparsity-enhancing techniques using a post-training optimization involving selected weight bit-flips. Empirical studies conducted on four deep-learning benchmarks demonstrate the achievements of BitWave: (1) Maximally realize 13.25x higher speedup, 7.71x efficiency compared to state-of-the-art sparsity-aware accelerators.

      <title>HCOMC: A Hierarchical Cooperative On-Ramp Merging Control Framework in Mixed Traffic Environment on Two-Lane Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century, and many in the robotics community are looking for ways to contribute. This paper presents a roadmap for climate-relevant robotics research, identifying high-impact opportunities for collaboration between roboticists and experts across climate domains such as energy, the built environment, transportation, industry, land use, and Earth sciences. These applications include problems such as energy systems optimization, construction, precision agriculture, building envelope retrofits, autonomous trucking, and large-scale environmental monitoring. Critically, we include opportunities to apply not only physical robots but also the broader robotics toolkit - including planning, perception, control, and estimation algorithms - to climate-relevant problems. A central goal of this roadmap is to inspire new research directions and collaboration by highlighting specific, actionable problems at the intersection of robotics and climate. This work represents a collaboration between robotics researchers and domain experts in various climate disciplines, and it serves as an invitation to the robotics community to bring their expertise to bear on urgent climate priorities.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Conformal Prediction-based Risk-Aware Model Predictive Planning in Dense, Uncertain Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time path planning in dense, uncertain environments remains a challenging problem, as predicting the future motions of numerous dynamic obstacles is computationally burdensome and unrealistic. To address this, we introduce Hybrid Prediction-based Risk-Aware Planning (HyPRAP), a prediction-based risk-aware path-planning framework which uses a hybrid combination of models to predict local obstacle movement. HyPRAP uses a novel Prediction-based Collision Risk Index (P-CRI) to evaluate the risk posed by each obstacle, enabling the selective use of predictors based on whether the agent prioritizes high predictive accuracy or low computational prediction overhead. This selective routing enables the agent to focus on high-risk obstacles while ignoring or simplifying low-risk ones, making it suitable for environments with a large number of obstacles. Moreover, HyPRAP incorporates uncertainty quantification through hybrid conformal prediction by deriving confidence bounds simultaneously achieved by multiple predictions across different models. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that HyPRAP effectively balances safety and computational efficiency by leveraging the diversity of prediction models. Extensive simulations validate these insights for more general settings, confirming that HyPRAP performs better compared to single predictor methods, and P-CRI performs better over naive proximity-based risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Native-AI Empowered Scalable Architectures and Solutions for Future Non-Terrestrial Networks: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient, reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures, the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle, hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are highlighted.</description>

      <title>IANN-MPPI: Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral Approach for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense traffic is challenging, often leading to overly conservative behavior and unmet planning objectives. This challenge stems from the AVs' limited ability to anticipate and respond to the interactive behavior of surrounding agents. Traditional decoupled prediction and planning pipelines rely on non-interactive predictions that overlook the fact that agents often adapt their behavior in response to the AV's actions. To address this, we propose Interaction-Aware Neural Network-Enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (IANN-MPPI) control, which enables interactive trajectory planning by predicting how surrounding agents may react to each control sequence sampled by MPPI. To improve performance in structured lane environments, we introduce a spline-based prior for the MPPI sampling distribution, enabling efficient lane-changing behavior. We evaluate IANN-MPPI in a dense traffic merging scenario, demonstrating its ability to perform efficient merging maneuvers.

      <title>Soft-Constrained Spatially Selective Active Noise Control for Open-fitting Hearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in spatially selective active noise control (SSANC) using multiple microphones have enabled hearables to suppress undesired noise while preserving desired speech from a specific direction. Aiming to achieve minimal speech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the optimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a soft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to trade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time- and frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise control and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed design. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting hearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise sources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and demonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the signal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of PESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained design.</description>

      <title>A Practical Analysis: Understanding Phase Noise Modelling in Time and Frequency Domain for Phase-Locked Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In MIMO systems, the presence of phase noise is a significant factor that can degrade performance. For MIMO testbeds build from SDR devices, phase noise cannot be ignored, particular in applications that require phase synchronization. This is especially relevant in MIMO systems that employ digital beamforming, where precise phase alignment is crucial. Accordingly, accurate phase noise modelling of SDR devices is essential. However, the information provided in data sheets for different SDR models varies widely and is often insufficient for comprehensive characterization of their phase noise performance. While numerical simulations of PLL phase noise behavior are documented in the literature, there is a lack of extensive measurements supported by appropriate system modelling. In this work, we present a practical phase noise modeling methodology applied to an SDR from the USRP X310 series. Based on measurement data, we derive estimates of key PLL performance indicators such as cycle-to-cycle jitter, oscillator constants, and PLL bandwidth. Furthermore, we propose a parametric model for the phase noise PSD of the PLL circuit and provide corresponding parameter estimates. This model can be used for further investigation into the impact of phase noise on MIMO system performance implemented by similar SDR devices.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff-3D: A 3D$\times$3D Radio Map Dataset and Generative Diffusion Based Benchmark for 6G Environment-Aware Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio maps (RMs) serve as a critical foundation for enabling environment-aware wireless communication, as they provide the spatial distribution of wireless channel characteristics. Despite recent progress in RM construction using data-driven approaches, most existing methods focus solely on pathloss prediction in a fixed 2D plane, neglecting key parameters such as direction of arrival (DoA), time of arrival (ToA), and vertical spatial variations. Such a limitation is primarily due to the reliance on static learning paradigms, which hinder generalization beyond the training data distribution. To address these challenges, we propose UrbanRadio3D, a large-scale, high-resolution 3D RM dataset constructed via ray tracing in realistic urban environments. UrbanRadio3D is over 37$\times$3 larger than previous datasets across a 3D space with 3 metrics as pathloss, DoA, and ToA, forming a novel 3D$\times$33D dataset with 7$\times$3 more height layers than prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset. To benchmark 3D RM construction, a UNet with 3D convolutional operators is proposed. Moreover, we further introduce RadioDiff-3D, a diffusion-model-based generative framework utilizing the 3D convolutional architecture. RadioDiff-3D supports both radiation-aware scenarios with known transmitter locations and radiation-unaware settings based on sparse spatial observations. Extensive evaluations on UrbanRadio3D validate that RadioDiff-3D achieves superior performance in constructing rich, high-dimensional radio maps under diverse environmental dynamics. This work provides a foundational dataset and benchmark for future research in 3D environment-aware communication. The dataset is available at https://github.com/UNIC-Lab/UrbanRadio3D.</description>

      <title>Selective Quantization Tuning for ONNX Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.</description>

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention. However, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic signals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world applications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states (Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach introduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box size as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing methods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy compared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.</description>

      <title>Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.</description>

      <title>A single chip 1.024 Tb/s silicon photonics PAM4 receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-efficient high-bandwidth interconnects play a key role in computing systems. Advances in silicon photonic electro-optic modulators and wavelength selective components have enabled the utilization of wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) in integrated optical transceivers, offering a high data-rate operation while achieving enhanced energy efficiency, bandwidth density, scalability, and the reach required for data-centers. Here, we report the demonstration of a single chip optical WDM PAM4 receiver, where by co-integration of a 32-channel optical demultiplexer (O-DeMux) with autonomous wavelength tuning and locking at a near-zero power consumption and a 32-channel ultra-low power concurrent electrical detection system, a record chip energy efficiency of under 0.38 pJ/bit is measured. The implemented 32 channel monolithic WDM optical receiver chip achieves an end-to-end latency of under 100 ps and a bit-error-rate of less than 10-12 with no equalization, pre-distortion, or digital-signal-processing, while operating at 1.024 Tb/s aggregate data-rate on a single input fiber, the largest reported data-rate for a WDM PAM4 receiver chip to date. The receiver bandwidth density of more than 3.55 Tb/s/mm2 corresponds to more than an order-of-magnitude larger bandwidth density-energy efficiency product compared to the state-of-the-art optical PAM4 receivers for beyond 100Gb/s links. The chip, integrated using GlobalFoundries 45CLO CMOS-photonic process, can be used for implementation of energy-efficient high data-rate optical links for AI applications.</description>

      <title>Embracing Fairness in Consumer Electricity Markets using an Automatic Market Maker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As consumer flexibility becomes expected, it is important that the market mechanisms which attain that flexibility are perceived as fair. We set out fairness issues in energy markets today, and propose a market design to address them. Consumption is categorised as either essential or flexible with different prices and reliability levels for each. Prices are generated by an Automatic Market Maker (AMM) based on instantaneous scarcity and resource is allocated using a novel Fair Play algorithm. We empirically show the performance of the system over 1 year for 101 UK households and benchmark its performance against more classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Observability and Generalized Sensor Placement for Nonlinear Quality Models in Drinking Water Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04202v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of optimal placement of water quality (WQ) sensors in water distribution networks (WDNs), with a focus on chlorine transport, decay, and reaction models. Such models are traditionally used as suitable proxies for WQ. The literature on this topic is inveterate, but has a key limitation: it utilizes simplified single-species decay and reaction models that do not capture WQ transients for nonlinear, multi-species interactions. This results in sensor placements (SP) that do not account for nonlinear WQ dynamics. Furthermore, as WQ simulations are parameterized by hydraulic profiles and demand patterns, the placement of sensors are often hydraulics-dependent. This study produces a greedy algorithm that addresses the two aforementioned limitations. The algorithm is grounded in nonlinear dynamic systems and observability theory, and yields SPs that are submodular and robust to hydraulic changes. Case studies on benchmark water networks are provided. The key findings provide practical recommendations for WDN operators.</description>

      <title>Robust Convergency Indicator using MIMO-PI Controller in the presence of disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PID controller remains the most widely adopted control architecture, with groundbreaking success across extensive implications. However, optimal parameter tuning for PID controller remains a critical challenge. Existing theories predominantly focus on linear time-invariant systems and Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) scenarios, leaving a research gap in addressing complex PID control problems for Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) nonlinear systems with disturbances. This study enhances controller robustness by leveraging insights into the velocity form of nonlinear systems. It establishes a quantitative metric to evaluate the robustness of MIMO-PI controller, clarifies key theories on how robustness influences exponential error stabilization. Guided by these theories, an optimal robust MIMO-PI controller is developed without oversimplifying assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller achieves effective exponential stabilization and exhibits exceptional robustness under the guidance of the proposed robust indicator. Notably, the robust convergence indicator can also effectively assess comprehensive performance.</description>

      <title>Sharp Hybrid Zonotopes: Set Operations and the Reformulation-linearization Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed integer set representations, and specifically hybrid zonotopes, have enabled new techniques for reachability and verification of nonlinear and hybrid systems. Mixed-integer sets which have the property that their convex relaxation is equal to their convex hull are said to be sharp. This property allows the convex hull to be computed with minimal overhead, and is known to be important for improving the convergence rates of mixed-integer optimization algorithms that rely on convex relaxations. This paper examines methods for formulating sharp hybrid zonotopes and provides sharpness-preserving methods for performing several key set operations. The paper then shows how the reformulation-linearization technique can be applied to create a sharp realization of a hybrid zonotope that is initially not sharp. A numerical example applies this technique to find the convex hull of a level set of a feedforward ReLU neural network.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Approaches to Enhance Safety in Autonomous Vehicles: Minimizing Lane Changes and Merging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promise enhanced safety and operational efficiency. However, frequent lane changes and merging maneuvers continue to pose significant safety risks and disrupt traffic flow. This paper introduces the Minimizing Lane Change Algorithm (MLCA), a state-machine-based approach designed to reduce unnecessary lane changes, thereby enhancing both traffic safety and efficiency. The MLCA algorithm prioritizes maintaining lane stability unless safety-critical conditions necessitate a lane change. The algorithm's effectiveness was evaluated through simulations conducted on the SUMO platform, comparing its performance against established models, including LC2017 and MOBIL. Results demonstrate substantial reductions in lane changes and collisions, leading to smoother traffic flow and improved safety metrics. Additionally, the study highlights the MLCA's adaptability to various traffic densities and roadway configurations, showcasing its potential for wide-scale deployment in real-world AV systems. Future work aims to validate these findings in more complex scenarios using the CARLA simulator, which will enable the testing of the algorithm under more dynamic and high-fidelity conditions, such as urban traffic environments with diverse road users. Moreover, the integration of cybersecurity measures for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication will be explored to ensure robust and secure data exchange, further enhancing the reliability and safety of AV operations. This research contributes to the broader goal of developing intelligent traffic systems that optimize both individual vehicle performance and overall traffic network efficiency.</description>

      <title>Robot Metabolism: Towards machines that can grow by consuming other machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological lifeforms can heal, grow, adapt, and reproduce -- abilities essential for sustained survival and development. In contrast, robots today are primarily monolithic machines with limited ability to self-repair, physically develop, or incorporate material from their environments. While robot minds rapidly evolve new behaviors through AI, their bodies remain closed systems, unable to systematically integrate material to grow or heal. We argue that open-ended physical adaptation is only possible when robots are designed using a small repertoire of simple modules. This allows machines to mechanically adapt by consuming parts from other machines or their surroundings and shed broken components. We demonstrate this principle on a truss modular robot platform. We show how robots can grow bigger, faster, and more capable by consuming materials from their environment and other robots. We suggest that machine metabolic processes like those demonstrated here will be an essential part of any sustained future robot ecology.</description>

      <title>SPARK: A Modular Benchmark for Humanoid Robot Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Safe Protective and Assistive Robot Kit (SPARK), a comprehensive benchmark designed to ensure safety in humanoid autonomy and teleoperation. Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general safety solutions. To facilitate safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and development, SPARK provides simulation benchmarks that compare safety approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore, SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots. For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion Capture System as external sensors, while offering interfaces for seamless integration with alternative hardware setups at the same time. This paper demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as accelerate relevant research.

      <title>Geometric Formulation of Unified Force-Impedance Control on SE(3) for Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an impedance control framework on the SE(3) manifold, which enables force tracking while guaranteeing passivity. Building upon the unified force-impedance control (UFIC) and our previous work on geometric impedance control (GIC), we develop the geometric unified force impedance control (GUFIC) to account for the SE(3) manifold structure in the controller formulation using a differential geometric perspective. As in the case of the UFIC, the GUFIC utilizes energy tank augmentation for both force-tracking and impedance control to guarantee the manipulator's passivity relative to external forces. This ensures that the end effector maintains safe contact interaction with uncertain environments and tracks a desired interaction force. Moreover, we resolve a non-causal implementation problem in the UFIC formulation by introducing velocity and force fields. Due to its formulation on SE(3), the proposed GUFIC inherits the desirable SE(3) invariance and equivariance properties of the GIC, which helps increase sample efficiency in machine learning applications where a learning algorithm is incorporated into the control law. The proposed control law is validated in a simulation environment under scenarios requiring tracking an SE(3) trajectory, incorporating both position and orientation, while exerting a force on a surface. The codes are available at https://github.com/Joohwan-Seo/GUFIC_mujoco.</description>

      <title>Active Probing with Multimodal Predictions for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges.
