      <title>Detection of a 2.85 micrometer Feature on 5 Spinel-rich Asteroids from JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ground-based observations of `Barbarian' L-type asteroids at 1 to 2.5-$\mu$m indicate that their near-infrared spectra are dominated by the mineral spinel, which has been attributed to a high abundance of calcium-aluminum inclusions (CAIs) -- the first solids to condense out of the protoplanetary disk during the formation of the Solar System. However, the spectral properties of these asteroids from 2.5 to 5-$\mu$m, a wavelength region that covers signatures of hydrated minerals, water, and organics, have not yet been explored. Here, we present 2 to 5-$\mu$m reflectance spectra of five spinel-rich asteroids obtained with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. All five targets exhibit a $\sim$ 2.85-$\mu$m absorption feature with a band depth of 3-6$\%$ that appears correlated in strength with that of the 2-$\mu$m spinel absorption feature. The shape and position of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature are not a good match to the 2.7-$\mu$m feature commonly seen in carbonaceous CM meteorites or C-type asteroids. The closest spectral matches are to the Moon and Vesta, suggesting commonalities in aqueous alteration across silicate bodies, infall of hydrated material, and/or space weathering by solar wind H implantation. Lab spectra of CO/CV chondrites, CAIs, as well as the minerals cronstedtite and spinel, also show a similar feature, providing clues into the origin of the 2.85-$\mu$m feature.</description>

      <title>Auto-Linear Phenomenon in Subsurface Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsurface imaging involves solving full waveform inversion (FWI) to predict geophysical properties from measurements. This problem can be reframed as an image-to-image translation, with the usual approach being to train an encoder-decoder network using paired data from two domains: geophysical property and measurement. A recent seminal work (InvLINT) demonstrates there is only a linear mapping between the latent spaces of the two domains, and the decoder requires paired data for training.
  This paper extends this direction by demonstrating that only linear mapping necessitates paired data, while both the encoder and decoder can be learned from their respective domains through self-supervised learning. This unveils an intriguing phenomenon (named Auto-Linear) where the self-learned features of two separate domains are automatically linearly correlated. Compared with existing methods, our Auto-Linear has four advantages: (a) solving both forward and inverse modeling simultaneously, (b) applicable to different subsurface imaging tasks and achieving markedly better results than previous methods, (c)enhanced performance, especially in scenarios with limited paired data and in the presence of noisy data, and (d) strong generalization ability of the trained encoder and decoder.</description>
