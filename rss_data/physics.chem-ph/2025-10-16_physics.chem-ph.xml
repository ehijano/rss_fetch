      <title>Data-Augmented Machine Learning for Predicting Biomass-Derived Hard Carbon Anode Performance in Sodium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomass-derived hard carbon has become the most promising anode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to its high capacity and excellent cycling stability. However, the effects of synthesis parameters and structural features on hard carbon's (HC) electrochemical performance are still unclear, requiring time-consuming and resource-intensive experimental investigations. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution by training on large datasets to predict hard carbon performance more efficiently, saving time and resources. In this study, four ML models were used to predict the capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC. Data augmentation based on the TabPFN technique was employed to improve model robustness under limited data conditions, and the relationships between features and electrochemical performance were examined. Notably, the XGBoost model achieved an R2 of 0.854 and an RMSE of 23.290 mAh g-1 for capacity prediction, and an R2 of 0.868 and an RMSE of 3.813% for ICE prediction. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) analyses identified carbonization temperature (Temperature_2) as the most important factor influencing both capacity and ICE. Furthermore, we used bamboo as the precursor to synthesize four hard carbons based on the predictive approach. The electrochemical performance of these samples closely matched our predictions. By leveraging machine-learning approach, this study provides an efficient framework for accelerating the screening process of biomass-derived hard carbon candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Analysis of Neutron Wavefunction Overlap and Nuclear Interaction Probability with Carborane Cage ($^{10}$B10) in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) leverages the nuclear reaction between thermal neutrons and boron-10 (B-10) atoms to induce selective tumor cell death. The spatial and quantum mechanical overlap between the neutron wavefunction and B-10 nuclei encapsulated in carborane cages (C2B10H12) is fundamental to optimizing therapeutic efficacy. This study presents a quantum mechanical framework to evaluate the neutron-boron interaction probability by modeling neutron wavefunctions and the spatial distribution of boron atoms within the carborane cages. Using spherical harmonics and density functional theory (DFT)-derived geometries of carborane, the neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections are quantitatively analyzed. The implications of neutron spin states, nuclear magnetic moments, and external perturbations on the neutron capture probability are discussed. The computed neutron scattering amplitudes and reaction cross sections provide a basis for evaluating neutron-boron interaction probabilities under varied quantum conditions. The proposed model offers theoretical insights into molecular-level design considerations for enhancing the efficiency of BNCT.</description>

      <title>Isomer effects on neutral-loss dissociation channels of nitrogen-substituted PAH dications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two nitrogen-containing isomers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), quinoline (Q) and isoquinoline (IQ), of composition C$_9$H$_7$N in collisions with 7~keV O$^+$ and 48~keV O$^{6+}$ projectile ions. Employing ion-ion coincidence mass spectrometry, we determine branching ratios for H-loss, C$_2$H$_2$-loss, and HCN-loss dissociation channels of Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$. The overall contribution of HCN-loss is found to be the dominant decay channel. A comparison with the results of a parallel experiment on naphthalene, the simplest PAH, reveals that HCN-loss in both isomers has a higher propensity than the analogous C$_2$H$_2$-loss of naphthalene. The positional identity of the nitrogen atom in the two isomers mainly manifests in many-body fragmentation of their dications. Potential energy surfaces of Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$ are further computed to explore complete fragmentation mechanisms. Parent dications (Q$^{2+}$ and IQ$^{2+}$) are identified to isomerize via seven-membered ring structures prior to elimination of C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN. While prompt dissociation is the primary pathway, the dominant channel of each neutral-loss class also exhibits delayed fragmentation.</description>

      <title>SimPoly: Simulation of Polymers with Machine Learning Force Fields Derived from First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymers are a versatile class of materials with widespread industrial applications. Advanced computational tools could revolutionize their design, but their complex, multi-scale nature poses significant modeling challenges. Conventional force fields often lack the accuracy and transferability required to capture the intricate interactions governing polymer behavior. Conversely, quantum-chemical methods are computationally prohibitive for the large systems and long timescales required to simulate relevant polymer phenomena. Here, we overcome these limitations with a machine learning force field (MLFF) approach. We demonstrate that macroscopic properties for a broad range of polymers can be predicted ab initio, without fitting to experimental data. Specifically, we develop a fast and scalable MLFF to accurately predict polymer densities, outperforming established classical force fields. Our MLFF also captures second-order phase transitions, enabling the prediction of glass transition temperatures. To accelerate progress in this domain, we introduce a benchmark of experimental bulk properties for 130 polymers and an accompanying quantum-chemical dataset. This work lays the foundation for a fully in silico design pipeline for next-generation polymeric materials.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Space Attention for Learning Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

      <title>Surface Properties of Ga-Cu Based Liquid-Metal Alloys: Impact of Cu Dilution Topography and Reaction Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the surface properties of Ga-Cu based liquid metal alloys, a promising material system for supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS). The impact of Cu dilution in the (liquid) Ga matrix is in-detail investigated by X-ray and UV photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) and Machine-Learned-Force Field (ML-FF) calculations. With decreasing Cu content, microscopic and macroscopic Ga-Cu model samples exhibit a shift of the Cu 2p core level line to higher binding energies (Eb) as well as a correspondingly shifted and narrowed d-band with respect to pure Cu, which we ascribe to site isolation. To study the property evolution of Ga-Cu at SCALMS reaction conditions, i.e., where Cu is present in liquid Ga, additional XPS measurements were performed between 100 and 500 oC. The observed Cu 2p shift to lower Eb is tentatively ascribed to changes in the local environment with increasing temperature, i.e. bond elongation, which is corroborated by ML-FF simulations. The increased Cu surface content at low temperatures is attributed to the presence of crystallized Cu-rich intermetallic compounds, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy images. In an attempt to generalize the findings for filled d-band transition metals (TMs) in liquid Ga also Ga-Ag and Ga-Au model systems were investigated. The observed insights may be another step of paving the way for an insight-driven development of low-temperature melting liquid metals for heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Corrosion Mechanism of Boro-Alumino-Phospho-Silicate Glass: Advanced Insights from Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Corrosion mechanism of minerals and glass is a critical study domain in geology and materials science, vital for comprehending material durability under various environmental conditions. Despite decades of extensive study, a core aspect of these mechanisms - specifically, the formation of amorphous alteration layers upon exposure to aqueous environments - remains controversial. In this study, the corrosion behavior of a boro-alumino-phospho-silicate glass (BAPS) was investigated using advanced solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and SEM techniques. The results reveal a uniform nanoscale phase separation into Al-P-rich and Al-Si-rich domains. During corrosion, the Al-P-rich domain undergoes gelation, whereas the Al-Si-rich domain remains vitreous, forming a gel layer comprised of both phases. Although SEM images show a sharp gel/glass interface - suggestive of a dissolution-precipitation mechanism - the phase coexistence within the gel layer provides definitive evidence against such a mechanism. Instead, we propose an in situ transformation mechanism governed by chemical reactions, involving: (i) preferential hydrolysis of Al-P-rich domain leading to porous gel regions; (ii) retention of Al-Si glass domains within the gel layer, with water infiltrating inter-network spaces; and (iii) selective leaching of phosphorus over aluminum, leading to reorganization of the gel network.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast exciton polaron dynamics in 2D Ruddlesden Popper lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional Ruddlesden Popper (2D) RP hybrid perovskites exhibit substantially higher chemical and structural stability than their three dimensional (3D) counterparts, positioning them as promising candidates for next generation optoelectronics. While quasiparticle dynamics in 3D perovskites are well studied, their 2D analogues remain comparatively underexplored. Here we systematically investigate the branching, dynamics, and interactions of free excitons (FEs) and exciton polarons EPs in monolayer 2D RP perovskites using visible range femtosecond transient absorption TA spectroscopy. We prepared monolayer 2D RP perovskite thin films with varied organic spacers and distinct fabrication routes for comparative analysis. We find that the EP binding energy is 50 65 meV in (BA)2PbI4 and 37 39 meV in (PEA)2PbI4, consistent with spacer layer dependent coupling as corroborated by FTIR. We reveal a dynamic equilibrium between FEs and EPs that persists for tens of picoseconds. Notably, the TA signatures differ by fabrication route films from the newly developed process show weaker Auger annihilation and a reduced hot phonon bottleneck than those from the conventional route trends consistent with fewer traps and impurities in the former. Coupled rate equation modeling reproduces the transients and quantifies the processes of hot carrier relaxation, exciton exciton annihilation, exciton phonon coupling, and FE EP interconversion. These results demonstrate that the chemical synthetic process (fabrication route) and spacer choice significantly influence EP stability and population balance, offering practical levers for engineering ultrafast photophysics in 2D perovskites and guiding the design of advanced optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Towards A Universally Transferable Acceleration Method for Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, sophisticated deep learning-based approaches have been developed for generating efficient initial guesses to accelerate the convergence of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the actual initial guesses are often density matrices (DM), quantities that can convert into density matrices also qualify as alternative forms of initial guesses. Hence, existing works mostly rely on the prediction of the Hamiltonian matrix for obtaining high-quality initial guesses. However, the Hamiltonian matrix is both numerically difficult to predict and intrinsically non-transferable, hindering the application of such models in real scenarios. In light of this, we propose a method that constructs DFT initial guesses by predicting the electron density in a compact auxiliary basis representation using E(3)-equivariant neural networks. Trained on small molecules with up to 20 atoms, our model is able to achieve an average 33.3% self-consistent field (SCF) step reduction on systems up to 60 atoms, substantially outperforming Hamiltonian-centric and DM-centric models. Critically, this acceleration remains nearly constant with increasing system sizes and exhibits strong transferring behaviors across orbital basis sets and exchange-correlation (XC) functionals. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first and robust candidate for a universally transferable DFT acceleration method. We are also releasing the SCFbench dataset and its accompanying code to facilitate future research in this promising direction.</description>

      <title>Superior Molecular Representations from Intermediate Encoder Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we first analyze the information flow in five diverse molecular encoders and find that intermediate layers retain more general-purpose features, whereas the final-layer specializes and compresses information. We then perform an empirical layer-wise evaluation across 22 property prediction tasks. We find that using frozen embeddings from optimal intermediate layers improves downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, up to 28.6%, compared to the final-layer. Furthermore, finetuning encoders truncated at intermediate depths achieves even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with increases as high as 40.8%, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Reduced Density Matrix Functional Theory And A Reduced Formulation Of Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical framework for reduced density matrix functional theory (RDMFT) is proposed. The work is inspired by and generalizes the work by E.H.~Lieb [E.H. Lieb, Int. J. Quant. Chem. 24(1983), pp.243--277] on density-functional theory (DFT). We introduce a Banach space for density matrices with finite kinetic energy. The dual space is a rich class of single-particle potentials, i.e., Hermitian forms. The ground state energy of an $N$-fermion system with external forces given by any such Hermitian form is expressed as the Legendre--Fenchel transform of a convex and lower semicontinuous ``universal'' reduced density matrix functional. The formalism is employed to provide a mathematical framework for density-functional theory (DFT). The main tool here is a rigorous definition of diagonals of reduced density matrices. The result is a refinement of Lieb's results on DFT applicable to a wide variety of models.</description>
