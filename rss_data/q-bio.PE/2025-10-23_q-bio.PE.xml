      <title>Prejudice driven spite: A discontinuous phase transition in ultimatum game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a mix of prejudiced and unprejudiced individuals engaged in strategic interactions, the individual intensity of prejudice is expected to have effect on overall level of societal prejudice. High level of prejudice should lead to discrimination that may manifest as unfairness and, perhaps, even spite. In this paper, we investigate this idea in the classical paradigm of the ultimatum game which we theoretically modify to introduce prejudice at the level of players, terming its intensity as prejudicity. The stochastic evolutionary game dynamics, in the regime of replication-selection, reveals the emergence of spiteful behaviour as a dominant behaviour via a first order phase transition -- a discontinuous jump in the frequency of spiteful individuals at a threshold value of prejudicity. The phase transition is quite robust and becomes progressively conspicuous in the limit of large population size where deterministic evolutionary game dynamics, viz., replicator dynamics, approximates the system closely. The emergence of spite driven by prejudice is also found to persist when one considers long-term evolutionary dynamics in the mutation-selection dominated regime.</description>

      <title>BATIS: Bayesian Approaches for Targeted Improvement of Species Distribution Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs), which aim to predict species occurrence based on environmental variables, are widely used to monitor and respond to biodiversity change. Recent deep learning advances for SDMs have been shown to perform well on complex and heterogeneous datasets, but their effectiveness remains limited by spatial biases in the data. In this paper, we revisit deep SDMs from a Bayesian perspective and introduce BATIS, a novel and practical framework wherein prior predictions are updated iteratively using limited observational data. Models must appropriately capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty to effectively combine fine-grained local insights with broader ecological patterns. We benchmark an extensive set of uncertainty quantification approaches on a novel dataset including citizen science observations from the eBird platform. Our empirical study shows how Bayesian deep learning approaches can greatly improve the reliability of SDMs in data-scarce locations, which can contribute to ecological understanding and conservation efforts.</description>

      <title>Log-normal Superstatistics in the Confined Motion of Ants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.03236v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the emergence of Log-normal Superstatistics in the collective motion of ants confined in a quasi-2D arena and exposed to a panic-inducing stimulus. A data-driven superstatistical Langevin model accurately reproduces the transition from stationary behavior to an organized escape response, characterized by non-Gaussian velocity distributions and a fluctuating diffusion coefficient. Our findings show that danger information propagates via a memory-limited, cascade-like mechanism, resulting in a stable cluster formation despite individual memory constraints. These discoveries establish a crucial connection between Superstatistics formalisms and living active matter beyond a unicellular level, and provide a foundation for the understanding of the biological origin of Log-normal type diffusion in confined environments.</description>
