      <title>Fr\'echet Vectors as sensitive tools for blind tests of CMB anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological data collected on a sphere, such as CMB anisotropies, are typically represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients, denoted as $a_{\ell m}$. The angular power spectrum, or $C_\ell$, serves as the fundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical data and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs) and the Fr\'echet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as Fr\'echet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact space, making them highly sensitive to small displacements of these points. This sensitivity makes FVs excellent indicators of statistical correlations between different multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data. Through simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and reconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly introduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying this to the 2018 Planck maps, we implement several improvements on previous model-independent tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. When compared with simulated maps that incorporate masking and anisotropic noise, for $2 \leq\ell \leq 1500$, while Planck's MVs appear consistent with these hypotheses, the corresponding FVs reject them with significances between 5.2 and $8.3\sigma$, depending on the component separation method.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with HI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the Universe, has traditionally been used to investigate astrophysical processes within and around our own Galaxy. In its chemically neutral, atomic form (known as HI in the astronomical literature), it has tremendous potential today as a tool for precision cosmology and testing theories of fundamental physics. Cosmological HI is accessed through two of its main spectral lines: the Lyman-$\alpha$, with a rest wavelength of 1216 $\r{A}$, in the ultraviolet and visible part of the spectrum, and the 21-cm, which manifests in the radio frequency band. A plethora of radio telescopes worldwide are focused on detecting the faint 21 cm signal from the dark ages and Cosmic Dawn, some of the earliest epochs of the Universe. This chapter will describe the formalism for doing cosmology with HI, the recent results from the facilities and their prospects for studying the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>The EDGES measurement disfavors an excess radio background during the cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018 the EDGES experiment claimed the first detection of the global cosmic 21cm signal, which featured an absorption trough centered around $z \sim 17$ with a depth of approximately -500mK. This amplitude is deeper than the standard prediction (in which the radio background is determined by the cosmic microwave background) by a factor of two and potentially hints at the existence of a radio background excess. While this result was obtained by fitting the data with a phenomenological flattened-Gaussian shape for the cosmological signal, here we develop a physical model for the inhomogeneous radio background sourced by the first galaxies hosting population III stars. Star formation in these galaxies is quenched at lower redshifts due to various feedback mechanisms, so they serve as a natural candidate for the excess radio background hinted by EDGES, without violating present day measurements by ARCADE2. We forward-model the EDGES sky temperature data, jointly sampling our physical model for the cosmic signal, a foreground model, and residual calibration errors. We compare the Bayesian evidences obtained by varying the complexity and prior ranges for the systematics. We find that the data is best explained by a model with seven log-polynomial foreground terms, and that it requires calibration residuals. Interestingly, the presence of a cosmic 21cm signal with a non-standard depth is decisively disfavored. This is contrary to previous EDGES analysis in the context of extra radio background models, serving as a caution against using a ''pseudo-likelihood'' built on a model (flattened Gaussian) that is different from the one being used for inference. We make our simulation code and associated emulator publicly-available.</description>

      <title>Assessing the growth of structure over cosmic time with CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model informed by cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies makes a precise prediction for the growth of matter density fluctuations over cosmic time on linear scales. A variety of cosmological observables offer independent and complementary ways of testing this prediction, but results have been mixed, with many constraints on the amplitude of structure $S_8$ being 2-3$\sigma$ lower than the expectation from Planck primary CMB anisotropies. It is currently unclear whether these discrepancies are due to observational systematics, non-linearities and baryonic effects or new physics. We review how gravitational lensing of the CMB has and will continue to provide insights into this problem, including through tomographic cross-correlations with galaxy surveys over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity with 3d Velocity Reconstruction from the Kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic velocity field is an unbiased probe of the total matter distribution but is challenging to measure directly at intermediate and high redshifts. The large-scale velocity field imprints a signal in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect. We perform the first 3d reconstruction of the large-scale velocity field from the kSZ effect by applying a quadratic estimator to CMB temperature maps and the 3d positions of galaxies. We do so by combining CMB data from the fifth data release of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (in combination with Planck) and a spectroscopic galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We then measure the galaxy-velocity cross-power spectrum and detect the presence of the kSZ signal at a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.2$\sigma$. Using this galaxy-velocity cross-correlation alone, we constrain the amplitude of local primordial non-Gaussianity finding $f_{\rm NL}=-90^{+210}_{-350}$. This pathfinder measurement sets the stage for joint galaxy-CMB kSZ constraints to significantly enhance the $f_{\rm NL}$ information obtained from galaxy surveys through sample variance cancellation.</description>

      <title>A dark energy parameterization independent constraint of the spatial curvature $\Omega_K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature $\Omega_K$ of the Universe has long been crucial in cosmology. In practice, this effort is often entangled with assumptions of dark energy. A combination of distance ($D_{\rm M}$, $D_{\rm L}$) and expansion rate ($H(z)$) measurements can break this degeneracy. However, fitting against discrete data points requires parameterizations of distance and expansion rate as functions of redshifts, which often induces cosmological model dependence. In this work, we propose a new dark energy model-independent parameterization of the cosmological comoving radial distance $\chi$. Fitting data combining distance ($D_{\rm M}$, $D_{\rm L}$) and Hubble parameter (or equivalently $D_H$) measurements, we are then able to obtain $\Omega_K$ in a dark energy model-independent manner. We test this parameterization and the associated fitting scheme with mock data generated with a wide range of fiducial dark energy equations of state ($-1.3&lt;w&lt;1.3$), finding that the best-fit $\Omega_K$ is always unbiased. Then we combine SDSS Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), and Observational Hubble Data (OHD) to constrain $\Omega_K$. We find a flat universe with $\Omega_K=-0.01\pm 0.09$. Most constraining power is contributed by SDSS BAO, with the BAO-alone constraint $\Omega_K=-0.03 \pm 0.10$. When replacing SDSS BAO with DESI year-one BAO measurement, we obtain $\Omega_K=0.06 \pm 0.08$. With the full DESI BAO data alone, we forecast $\sigma(\Omega_K)\sim 0.03$. Our result verifies the flatness of the universe free of dark energy modeling, and the proposed parameterization would be useful for future investigation of $\Omega_K$ and other parameters of interest, such as the horizon radius.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmological Principle with weak lensing shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle is a cornerstone of the standard model of cosmology and shapes how we view the Universe and our place within it. It is imperative, then, to devise multiple observational tests which can identify and quantify possible violations of this foundational principle. One possible method of probing large-scale anisotropies involves the use of weak gravitational lensing. We revisit this approach in order to analyse the imprint of late-time anisotropic expansion on cosmic shear. We show that the cross-correlation of shear $E$- and $B$-modes on large scales can be used to constrain the magnitude (and possibly direction) of anisotropic expansion. We estimate the signal to noise for multipoles $10\lesssim \ell\lesssim 100$ that is achievable by a Euclid-like survey. Our findings suggest that such a survey could detect the $E$-$B$ signal for reasonable values of the late-time anisotropy parameter.</description>

      <title>The overconcentrated dark halo in the strong lens SDSS J0946+1006 is a subhalo: evidence for self interacting dark matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of dark matter is poorly constrained on subgalactic scales. Alternative models to cold dark matter, such as warm dark matter or self-interacting dark matter, could produce very different dark haloes on these scales. One of the few known dark haloes smaller than a galaxy was discovered in the triple source plane strong lens system J0946+1006. Previous studies have found that this structure is much more concentrated than expected in $\Lambda$CDM, but have assumed the dark halo is at the same redshift as the main deflector ($z_{\rm main}=0.222$). In this paper, we fit for the redshift of this dark halo. We reconstruct the first two sources in the system using a forward modelling approach, allowing for additional complexity from multipole perturbations. We find that the perturber redshift is $z_{\rm halo} = {0.207}^{+0.019}_{-0.019}$, and lower bounds on the evidence strongly prefer a subhalo over a line-of-sight structure. Whilst modelling both background sources does not improve constraints on the redshift of the subhalo, it breaks important degeneracies affecting the reconstruction of multipole perturbations. We find that the subhalo is a more than $5\sigma$ outlier from the $\Lambda$CDM $v_{\rm max}$-$r_{\rm max}$ relation and has a steep profile with an average slope of $\gamma_{\rm 2D} = {-1.81}^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ for radii between $0.75-1.25$ kpc. This steep slope might indicate dark matter self-interactions causing the subhalo to undergo gravothermal collapse; such collapsed haloes are expected to have $\gamma_{\rm 2D} \approx -2$.</description>

      <title>Globally Stable Dark Energy in F(R) Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $F(R)$ models for dark energy generally exhibit a weak curvature singularity, which can be cured by adding an $R^2$ term. This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</description>

      <title>Revisiting holographic dark energy after DESI 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New insights from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024 baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data, in conjunction with cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernova (SN) data, suggest that dark energy may not be a cosmological constant. In this work, we investigate the cosmological implications of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE) models, utilizing CMB, DESI BAO, and SN data. By considering the combined DESI BAO and SN data, we determine that in the IHDE model, the parameter $c &gt; 1$ and the dark-energy equation of state $w$ does not cross $-1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level, whereas in the HDE model, it marginally falls below this threshold. Upon incorporating CMB data, we observe that in the HDE model, the parameter $c &lt; 1$ and $w$ crosses $-1$ at a level beyond $10\sigma$. Conversely, for the IHDE model, the likelihood of $w$ crossing $-1$ is considerably diminished, implying that the introduction of interaction within the HDE model could potentially resolve or mitigate the cosmic big rip conundrum. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the HDE and IHDE models are statistically as viable as the $\Lambda$CDM model when assessing Bayesian evidence with DESI BAO data combined with SN data. However, when CMB data are added, the HDE and IHDE models are significantly less favored compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our findings advocate for further exploration of the HDE and IHDE models using forthcoming, more precise late-universe observations.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in the distribution of HSC galaxy spin directions: comment on arXiv:2410.18884v1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, an asymmetry in the large-scale distribution of galaxy spin directions has been observed in data from all relevant digital sky surveys, all showing a higher number of galaxies rotating in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way as observed from Earth. Additionally, JWST deep fields have shown that the asymmetry is clear and obvious, and can be sensed even by the naked human eye. These experiments were performed using two separate statistical methods: standard binomial distribution and simple $\chi^2$ statistics. Stiskalek \&amp; Desmond (2024) suggested that the asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions is due to the use of binomial or $\chi^2$ statistics. Instead, they developed a new complex ad-hoc statistical method that shows random distribution in galaxy spin directions, and specifically in data from HSC. Source code for the method was also made available. The primary downside of the new method is that it is not able to identify asymmetry in the distribution of galaxy spin directions. Even when the new method is provided with synthetic data with extreme and obvious asymmetry, it still reports a null-hypothesis Universe with random distribution. That shows empirically that the method cannot sense asymmetry in the distribution of the directions of rotation of galaxies. While this further concludes that the distribution of galaxy spin direction as observed from Earth is not symmetric, it is not necessarily an indication of an anomaly in the large-scale structure. The excessive number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way can also be driven by the internal structure of galaxies and the physics of galaxy rotation. The phenomenon can be related to other puzzling anomalies such the Ho tension. Data are publicly available, and no code is needed to reproduce the results since only conventional statistics is used.</description>

      <title>JWST observations constrain the time evolution of fine structure constants and dark energy - electromagnetic coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was hypothesized in the literature that some physical parameters may be time-evolving and the astrophysical data can serve as a probe. Recently, James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have released its early observations. In this work, we select the JWST spectroscopic observations of the high redshift ($z&gt;7.1$) galaxies with strong [OIII] ($\lambda=4959$ \AA \,and $5007$ \AA \,in the rest frame) emission lines to constraint the evolution of the fine structure constant ($\alpha$). With the spectra from two galaxies at redshifts of $7.19$ and $8.47$, the deviation of $\alpha$ to its fiducial value is found to be as small as $0.44^{+8.4+1.7}_{-8.3-1.7} \times 10^{-4}$ and $-10.0^{+18+1.5}_{-18-1.5} \times 10^{-4}$, respectively (the first error is statistical and the latter is systematic). The combination of our results with the previous data reveals that $\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{d \alpha}{dt} = 0.30^{+4.5}_{-4.5} \times 10^{-17}~{\rm yr^{-1}}$. Clearly, there is no evidence for a cosmic evolution of $\alpha$. The prospect of further constraining the time evolution of $\alpha$ is also discussed. The scalar field of dark energy is hypothesized to drive the acceleration of the universe's expansion through an interaction with the electromagnetic field. By integrating the observational data of the fine-structure constant variation, $\frac{\Delta\alpha}{\alpha}(z)$, we have established a stringent upper limit on the coupling strength between dark energy and electromagnetism. Our analysis yields $\zeta \leq 3.92 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95\% confidence level, representing the most stringent bound to date.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation and non-perturbative power spectrum beyond slow roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic inflation, together with the $\Delta N$ formalism, provides a powerful tool for estimating the large-scale behaviour of primordial fluctuations. We construct a numerical code to capture the non-perturbative statistics of such fluctuations and test our code to obtain the exponential non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbations. We provide a numerical algorithm to compute the non-perturbative curvature power spectrum and apply it to slow-roll (SR) and ultra-slow-roll (USR) single-field models of inflation. For the USR case, we successfully reproduce the peak in the power spectrum, which agrees to a certain accuracy with the perturbative power spectrum. We highlight some important differences between non-perturbative and perturbative approaches that may suggest the inconsistency of the $\Delta N$ formalism at the transition stages between attractor and non-attractor regimes.</description>

      <title>A consistency relation for induced gravitational wave anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the anisotropies in the spectrum of gravitational waves induced by scalar modes after the end of inflation in canonical, single-field models are completely determined by the tilt of the scalar and tensor power spectra. The latter contains information about anisotropies produced due to the propagation of the tensor modes in an inhomogeneous Universe, whereas the former represents the anisotropies generated at the time of production and arise only when non-Gaussian corrections to the angular power spectrum are considered. Our proof takes into account all scalar interactions in the cubic inflaton Lagrangian.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning Methods for Detecting Atypical Structures in Astronomical Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper explores the use of various machine learning methods to search for heterogeneous or atypical structures on astronomical maps. The study was conducted on the maps of the cosmic microwave background radiation from the Planck mission obtained at various frequencies. The algorithm used found a number of atypical anomalous structures in the actual maps of the Planck mission. This paper details the machine learning model used and the algorithm for detecting anomalous structures. A map of the position of such objects has been compiled. The results were compared with known astrophysical processes or objects. Future research involves expanding the dataset and applying various algorithms to improve the detection and classification of outliers.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90~GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z = 0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5 \pm 0.6 \times 10^{15}~\rm M_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modelling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24 \pm 4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report lower limits for the shock Mach numbers of $M = 1.6 \pm 0.4$ and $M = 1.9 \pm 0.3$, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $2.9_{-0.3}^{+0.5}$ keV and a density $(1.60\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of 150 relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim4.4\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim 6.8 \pm 2.7 \times 10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4-10\%.</description>

      <title>Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, evaporation of a black hole immersed in a de Sitter environment is considered. Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime is used to model the process in a scenario of accelerated expansion of the Universe. The role of observers is highlighted in the development and Hayward thermodynamics for non stationary geometries is employed in the description of the compact objects. The results of the proposed dynamical model are compared with the usual description based on stationary geometries, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs). It is found how the timescale of evaporation depends on the choice of a cosmological observer. It may differ substantially from the treatment based on stationary models for black holes. In particular, the standard assertion that there is a fixed initial mass just below $10^{15} \, \text{g} \sim 10^{-18} M_\odot$ for the PBHs which are ending their evaporation process today is imprecise, even when possible quantum corrections at the late stages are not considered. Deviations from this prediction appear when the evaporation is measured with respect to the cosmological time.</description>

      <title>Inflationary constraints on the moduli-dependent species scale in modular invariant theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a broad class of modular inflation models predicts the emergence of new physics within an energy range of approximately $10^{15}\, \mathrm{GeV}$ to $10^{17} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. This prediction arises by comparing the moduli-dependent species scale with observational constraints on inflation. Specifically, we illustrate this within the context of $SL(2, \mathbb{Z})$-modular inflation models by re-expressing inflationary observables in terms of the species scale. We further discuss the implications of this approach for generic Calabi-Yau threefolds, showing that this reformulation allows us to directly constrain the fundamental parameters related to the geometry of extra dimensions, specifically the second Chern numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-photon oscillation effect provides a possible explanation for the presence of very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-ray signals from distant sources. In this work, we propose a model-dependent method to select possible sources that may give sufficient constraints on the axion parameters. We investigate such effect in the spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) B2 2234+28A and 3C 454.3 based on data obtained from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) and MAGIC U.L. We utilize the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to fit the axion parameters, yielding a result of $g_{a\gamma}=3.05^{+0.51}_{-0.31} \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for the axion-photon coupling strength and $m_{a}=5.25^{+2.35}_{-2.65} \times 10^{-8} $ eV for the axion mass. We also perform 95\% confidence level (CL) constraints to set an upper limit for $g_{a\gamma}$.</description>

      <title>Black hole jets on the scale of the Cosmic Web</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets launched by supermassive black holes transport relativistic leptons, magnetic fields, and atomic nuclei from the centres of galaxies to their outskirts and beyond. These outflows embody the most energetic pathway by which galaxies respond to their Cosmic Web environment. Studying black hole feedback is an astrophysical frontier, providing insights on star formation, galaxy cluster stability, and the origin of cosmic rays, magnetism, and heavy elements throughout the Universe. This feedback's cosmological importance is ultimately bounded by the reach of black hole jets, and could be sweeping if jets travel far at early epochs. Here we present the joint LOFAR-uGMRT-Keck discovery of a black hole jet pair extending over $7$ megaparsecs -- the largest galaxy-made structure ever found. The outflow, seen $7.5$ gigayears into the past, spans two-thirds of a typical cosmic void radius, thus penetrating voids at ${\sim}95\%$ probability. This system demonstrates that jets can avoid destruction by magnetohydrodynamical instabilities over cosmological distances, even at epochs when the Universe was 15 to 7 times denser than it is today. Whereas previous record-breaking outflows were powered by radiatively inefficient active galactic nuclei, this outflow is powered by a radiatively efficient active galactic nucleus, a type common at early epochs. If, as implied, a population of early void-penetrating outflows existed, then black hole jets could have overwritten the fields from primordial magnetogenesis. This outflow shows that energy transport from supermassive black holes operates on scales of the Cosmic Web and raises the possibility that cosmic rays and magnetism in the intergalactic medium have a non-local, cross-void origin.</description>

      <title>The special case of slow-roll attractors in de Sitter: Non-Markovian noise and evolution of entanglement entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the evolution of the reduced density matrix of inflationary perturbations, coupled to a heavy entropic field via the leading-order term within the Effective Field Theory of Inflation, for two nearly de Sitter backgrounds. We perform a full quantum treatment of the open system and derive a Fokker-Planck equation to describe decoherence and the entanglement structure of the adiabatic perturbations. We find that exotic phenomena, such as recoherence and transient negative growth of entanglement entropy, appearing for the attractor solution, are absent for the non-attractor background. We comment on the relationship of these to the non-Markovian nature of the system. Finally, we generalise to the case where a few e-folds of ultra-slow roll evolution are sandwiched between phases of slow-roll inflation to find its (memory) effects on the curvature perturbation.</description>

      <title>Chiral Gravitational Wave Background from Audible Axion via Nieh-Yan Term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be probed through gravitational waves indirectly, often referred to as "audible axions". The usual concept of audible axion relies on the coupling between the axions and the gauge fields. Here we consider an axion-like mechanism with coupling to the Nieh-Yan term. This interaction leads to the direct and efficient production of gravitational waves during the radiation-dominated era, originating from the tachyonic instability of the gravitational perturbations with the Nieh-Yan term. We calculate the energy spectral density of the chiral gravitational wave background and the comoving energy density of axion-like fields. Based on the numerical results, we explore the parameter space of axion masses and decay constants for detectable gravitational wave signals, either in pulsar timing arrays or space-based gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Unitarity Violation in Radiative Capture Transitions to Dark Matter Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of bound states of non-relativistic dark matter particles subject to long-range interactions through radiative capture. The initial scattering and final bound states are described by Coulomb potentials with different strengths, as relevant for non-abelian gauge interactions or theories featuring charged scalars. For bound states with generic quantum numbers $n$ and $\ell$, we provide closed-form expressions for the bound-state formation (BSF) cross sections of monopole, dipole and quadrupole transitions, and of arbitrary multipole order when $\ell=n-1$. This allows us to investigate in detail a strong enhancement of BSF that occurs for initial states in a repulsive potential. For $\ell=n-1\gg 1$, we show that the BSF cross section for each single bound state violates the perturbative unitarity bound in the vicinity of a certain critical initial velocity, and provide an interpretation in terms of a smooth matching of classical trajectories. When summing the BSF cross section over all possible bound states in the final state, this leads to a unitarity violation below a certain velocity, but within the validity range of the weakly coupled non-relativistic description. We identify an effectively strong interaction as the origin of this unitarity violation, which is caused by an "anomalously" large overlap of scattering and bound-state wave functions in Coulomb potentials of different strength.</description>

      <title>The impact of large-scale galaxy clustering on the variance of the Hellings-Downs correlation: numerical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing array experiments have recently found evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background, which induces correlations among pulsar timing residuals described by the Hellings and Downs (HD) curve. Standard calculations of the HD correlation and its variance assume an isotropic background. However, for a background of astrophysical origin, we expect a higher GW spectral density in directions with higher galaxy number densities. In a companion paper, we have developed a theoretical formalism to account for the anisotropies arising from large-scale galaxy clustering, leading to a new contribution to the variance of the HD correlation. In this subsequent work, we provide numerical results for this novel effect. We consider a GW background resulting from mergers of supermassive black hole binaries, and relate the merger number density to the overdensity of galaxies. We find that anisotropies due to large-scale galaxy clustering lead to a standard deviation of the HD correlation at most at percent level, remaining well below the standard contributions to the HD variance. Hence, this kind of anisotropies in the GW source distribution does not represent a substantial contamination to the correlations of timing residuals in present and future PTA surveys. Suitable statistical methods to extract the galaxy clustering signal from PTA data will be investigated in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a cosmology-independent method to constrain cosmological models from the latest 221 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) sample, including 49 GRBs from Fermi catalog with the Amati relation (the $E_{\rm p}$-${E}_{\rm iso}$ correlation), which are calibrated by using a Gaussian process from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sample. With 182 GRBs at $0.8\le z\le8.2$ in the Hubble diagram and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.348^{+0.048}_{-0.066}$ and $h$ = $0.680^{+0.029}_{-0.029}$ for the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ = $0.318^{+0.067}_{-0.059}$, $h$ = $0.704^{+0.055}_{-0.068}$, $w$ = $-1.21^{+0.32}_{-0.67}$ for the flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with those in which the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological parameters fitted simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reanalyse the Pantheon+ supernova catalogue to compare a cosmology with non-FLRW evolution, the timescape cosmology, with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. To this end, we analyse the Pantheon+ for a geometric comparison between the two models. We construct a covariance matrix to be as independent of cosmology as possible, including independence from the FLRW geometry and peculiar velocity with respect to FLRW average evolution. This framework goes far beyond most other definitions of model independence. We introduce new statistics to refine Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) light-curve analysis. In addition to conventional galaxy correlation functions used to define the scale of statistical homogeneity we introduce empirical statistics which enables refined analysis of the distribution biases of SNe Ia light-curve parameters $\beta c$ and $\alpha x_1$. For lower redshifts, the Bayesian analysis highlights important features attributable to the increased number of low-redshift supernovae, the artefacts of model-dependent light-curve fitting and the cosmic structure through which we observe supernovae. This indicates the need for cosmology-independent data reduction to conduct a stronger investigation of the emergence of statistical homogeneity and to compare alternative cosmologies in light of recent challenges to the standard model. Dark energy is generally invoked as a place-holder for new physics. For the first time, we find evidence that the timescape cosmology may provide a better overall fit than $\Lambda$CDM and that its phenomenology may help disentangle other astrophysical puzzles. Our from-first-principles reanalysis of Pantheon+ supports future deeper studies between the interplay of matter and nonlinear spacetime geometry in a data-driven setting.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological information is usually extracted from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest correlations using only either large-scale information interpreted through linear theory or using small-scale information interpreted by means of expensive hydrodynamical simulations. A complete cosmological interpretation of the 3D correlations at all measurable scales is challenged by the need of more realistic models including the complex growth of non-linear small scales that can only be studied within large hydrodynamical simulations. Past work were often limited by the trade off between the simulated cosmological volume and the resolution of the low-density intergalactic medium from which the Lyman-$\alpha$ signal originates. We conduct a suite of hydrodynamical simulations of the intergalactic medium, including one of the largest Lyman-$\alpha$ simulations ever performed in terms of volume (640 $h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$), alongside simulations in smaller volumes with resolutions up to 25 $h^{-1}\mathrm{kpc}$, which will be further improved to show resolution convergence in future studies. We compare the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra predicted by those simulations to different non-linear models. The inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ bias and redshift space distortion (RSD) parameters, $b_\alpha$ and $\beta_\alpha$ are in remarkable agreement with those measured in SDSS and DESI data. We find that, contrary to intuition, the convergence of large-scale modes of the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra, which determines $\beta_\alpha$, is primarily influenced by the resolution of the simulation box through mode coupling, rather than the box size itself. Finally, we study the BAO signal encoded in the 3D Lyman-$\alpha$ power spectra. For the first time with a hydrodynamical simulation, we clearly detect the BAO signal, however we only marginally detect its damping, associated with the non-linear growth of the structures.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIIa. Microwave background parity violation without parity-violating microphysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model, which assumes statistical isotropy and parity invariance, predicts the absence of correlations between even-parity and odd-parity observables of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Contrary to these predictions, large-angle CMB temperature anomalies generically involve correlations between even-$\ell$ and odd-$\ell$ angular power spectrum $C_\ell$, while recent analyses of CMB polarization have revealed non-zero equal-$\ell$ $EB$ correlations. These findings challenge the conventional understanding, suggesting deviations from statistical isotropy, violations of parity, or both. Cosmic topology, which involves changing only the boundary conditions of space relative to standard cosmology, offers a compelling framework to potentially account for such parity-violating observations. Topology inherently breaks statistical isotropy, and can also break homogeneity and parity, providing a natural paradigm for explaining observations of parity-breaking observables without the need to add parity violation to the underlying microphysics. Our investigation delves into the harmonic space implications of topology for CMB correlations, using as an illustrative example $EB$ correlations generated by tensor perturbations under both parity-preserving and parity-violating scenarios. Consequently, these findings not only challenge the foundational assumptions of the standard cosmological model but also open new avenues for exploring the topological structure of the Universe through CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Effects of primordial fluctuations on relic neutrino simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After decoupling, relic neutrinos traverse the evolving gravitational imhomogeneities along their trajectories. Once they turn non-relativistic, this results in a significant amplification of the anisotropies in the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). Past studies have reconstructed the phase-space distribution of relic neutrinos from the local distribution of matter (accounting for the Milky Way halo and the surrounding large-scale structures), but have neglected the C$\nu$B anisotropies in the initial conditions of neutrino trajectories. Using our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework, we show that including these primordial fluctuations in the initial conditions can be important, as it produces similar effects on the abundance and anisotropies of the C$\nu$B as the inclusion of large-scale structures beyond the Milky Way halo. Interpretability of data from future C$\nu$B observatories like PTOLEMY therefore depends on correctly modelling these effects.</description>

      <title>Halo mass functions at high redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations of very early galaxies, at $\rm{z \gtrsim 10}$, have led to claims that tension exists between the sizes and luminosities of high-redshift galaxies and what is predicted by standard $\Lambda$CDM models. Here we use the adaptive mesh refinement code $\texttt{Enzo}$ and the N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics code $\texttt{SWIFT}$ to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against the results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal is to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived from (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what role any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and theory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and (semi-) analytic halo mass function fits is less than a factor of 2 (at $\rm{z \sim 10}$) within the mass range of galaxies currently being observed by JWST, and is therefore not a dominant source of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.</description>

      <title>An Independent Measure of the Kinematic Dipole from SDSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) catalogs with precise spectroscopic redshifts to estimate the kinematic redshift dipole caused by the proper motion of the Solar system. We find that the velocity extracted from the kinematic dipole is consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background inferred values. Although the small sky coverage and limited number density of the SDSS sources constrain us from obtaining precise and robust measurements, we leverage the redshift dipole method to estimate the kinematic dipole. The velocity measurements in this study are insensitive to intrinsic clustering, associated with the source count dipole. The kinematic dipole measured in this work and its consistency with CMB values do not guarantee isotropy at large scales. The anisotropy (excess dipole) measured with the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and the WISE Catalog (CatWISE) could be due to the intrinsic distribution of galaxies. The results in this work focus solely on the kinematic dipole term.</description>

      <title>Limits on planetary-mass primordial black holes from the OGLE high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale gravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large population of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years, some authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) comprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way may be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of short-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic Clouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic Clouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars located in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and found only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale events were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to infer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in dark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4 \times 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\,M_{\odot}$ (planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That rules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected toward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of free-floating or wide-orbit planets.</description>

      <title>Gravitational reheating formulas and bounds in oscillating backgrounds II: Constraints on the spectral index and gravitational dark matter production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reheating temperature plays a crucial role in the early universe's evolution, marking the transition from inflation to the radiation-dominated era. It directly impacts the number of $e$-folds and, consequently, the observable parameters of inflation, such as the spectral index of scalar perturbations. By establishing a relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the spectral index, we can derive constraints on inflationary models. Specifically, the range of viable reheating temperatures imposes bounds on the spectral index, which can then be compared with observational data, such as those from the Planck satellite, to test the consistency of various models with cosmological observations. Additionally, in the context of dark matter production, we demonstrate that gravitational reheating provides a viable mechanism when there is a relationship between the mass of the dark matter particles and the mass of the particles responsible for reheating. This connection offers a pathway to link dark matter genesis with inflationary and reheating parameters, allowing for a unified perspective on early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>MUltiplexed Survey Telescope: Perspectives for Large-Scale Structure Cosmology in the Era of Stage-V Spectroscopic Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MUltiplexed Survey Telescope (MUST) is a 6.5-meter telescope under development. Dedicated to highly-multiplexed, wide-field spectroscopic surveys, MUST observes over 20,000 targets simultaneously using 6.2-mm pitch positioning robots within a ~5 deg2 field of view. MUST aims to carry out the first Stage-V spectroscopic survey in the 2030s to map the 3D Universe with over 100 million galaxies and quasars, spanning from the nearby Universe to redshift z~5.5, corresponding to around 1 billion years after the Big Bang. To cover this extensive redshift range, we present an initial conceptual target selection algorithm for different types of galaxies, from local bright galaxies, luminous red galaxies, and emission line galaxies to high-redshift (2 &lt; z &lt; 5.5) Lyman-break galaxies. Using Fisher forecasts, we demonstrate that MUST can address fundamental questions in cosmology, including the nature of dark energy, test of gravity theories, and investigations into primordial physics. This is the first paper in the series of science white papers for MUST, with subsequent developments focusing on additional scientific cases such as galaxy and quasar evolution, Milky Way physics, and dynamic phenomena in the time-domain Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a phase transition may take place in the early Universe at a temperature $T_*$ via a Standard Model singlet scalar field which happens to couple to right handed neutrinos (RHN) resulting a temperature dependent mass for them that finally relaxes to a constant value after electroweak phase transition (EWPT). As a result, a requisite amount of lepton asymmetry can be produced at a temperature close to $T_*$ satisfying the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe via sphaleron process even when the zero temperature masses of the RHNs fall in sub GeV regime providing a testable scenario for leptogenesis. Interestingly, the framework is also capable of predicting a primordial lepton asymmetry (generated at a temperature below the EWPT), as hinted by helium abundance measuring experiments, bearing a correlation with early phase of leptogenesis.</description>

Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <title>Majoron-Driven Leptogenesis in Gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario in the gauged $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ model. Achieving successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase is challenging due to the absence of a CP phase, caused by restriction from the gauge symmetry. To overcome this issue, we introduce an additional global symmetry, $U(1)_{B-L}$, and a scalar field $\Phi$ responsible for breaking this symmetry. Through the kinetic misalignment mechanism, the majoron field associated with $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry breaking has a kinetic motion in the early universe. Subsequently, time-dependent majoron field background induces the background CP phase dynamically, leading to successful leptogenesis in the $U(1)_{L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}}$ symmetric phase. Furthermore, majoron itself serves as a dark matter candidate in this scenario. As one of the phenomenological applications, we consider the model that can also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.</description>

      <title>The Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our quest to understand the generation of cosmological perturbations, we face two serious obstacles: we do not have direct information about the environment experienced by primordial perturbations during inflation, and our observables are practically limited to correlators of massless fields, heavier fields and derivatives decaying exponentially in the number of e-foldings. The flexible and general framework of open systems has been developed precisely to face similar challenges. Building on previous work, we develop a Schwinger-Keldysh path integral description for an open effective field theory of inflation, describing the possibly dissipative and non-unitary evolution of the Goldstone boson of time translations interacting with an unspecified environment, under the key assumption of locality in space and time. Working in the decoupling limit, we study the linear and interacting theory in de Sitter and derive predictions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that depend on a finite number of effective couplings organised in a derivative expansion. The smoking gun of interactions with the environment is an enhanced but finite bispectrum close to the folded kinematical limit. We demonstrate the generality of our approach by matching our open effective theory to an explicit model. Our construction provides a standard model to simultaneously study phenomenological predictions as well as quantum information aspects of the inflationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Leptogenesis with sub-GeV Axion Like Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A derivative coupling of an axion like particle (ALP) with a B-L current may lead to the baryon asymmetry of the universe via spontaneous leptogenesis provided a lepton number breaking interaction prevails in thermal equilibrium. Conventionally, such scenario works only for heavy ALPs and high reheating temperature due to the fact that the same lepton number breaking contribution is tied up with neutrino mass generation also. In this work, we propose inert Higgs doublet assisted lepton number violating operator to relieve such tension so as to generate lepton asymmetry (of freeze-in/out type) with a much lower reheating temperature that can accommodate light (sub-GeV) ALPs sensitive to current and future ALP searches.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the first and second order cosmological perturbation equations in f(R) modified gravity theory and provide the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves. We find that the effects of modified gravity not only change the form of the equation of motion of second order scalar induced gravitational waves but also contribute an additional anisotropic stress tensor, composed of first order scalar perturbations, to the source term of the gravitational waves. We calculate the energy density spectrum of second order scalar induced gravitational waves in the HS model. Utilizing current pulsar timing array observational data, we perform a rigorous Bayesian analysis of the parameter space of the HS model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological evolution of dark matter subhaloes under tidal stripping by growing Milky Way-like galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the findings of a comprehensive and detailed analysis of merger tree data from ultra-high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations. The analysis, conducted with a particle mass resolution of $5 \times 10^3 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ and a halo mass resolution of $10^7 h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, provides sufficient accuracy to suppress numerical artefacts. This study elucidates the dynamical evolution of subhaloes associated with the Milky Way-like host haloes. Unlike more massive dark matter haloes, which have been extensively studied, these subhaloes follow a distinct mass evolution pattern: an initial accretion phase, followed by a tidal stripping phase where mass is lost due to the tidal forces of the host halo. The transition from accretion to stripping, where subhaloes reach their maximum mass, occurs around a redshift of $z\simeq1$. Smaller subhaloes reach this point earlier, while larger ones do so later. Our analysis reveals that over 80 per cent of subhaloes have experienced mass loss, underscoring the universality of tidal stripping in subhalo evolution. Additionally, we derived the eccentricities and pericentre distances of subhalo orbits from the simulations and compare them with those of nearby satellite galaxies observed by the Gaia satellite. The results demonstrate a significant alignment between the orbital elements predicted by the cold dark matter model and the observed data, providing robust support for the model as a credible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Detection of Thermal Emission at Millimeter Wavelengths from Low-Earth Orbit Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of satellite thermal emission at millimeter wavelengths is presented using data from the 3rd-Generation receiver on the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G). This represents the first reported detection of thermal emission from artificial satellites at millimeter wavelengths. Satellite thermal emission is shown to be detectable at high signal-to-noise on timescales as short as a few tens of milliseconds. An algorithm for downloading orbital information and tracking known satellites given observer constraints and time-ordered observatory pointing is described. Consequences for cosmological surveys and short-duration transient searches are discussed, revealing that the integrated thermal emission from all large satellites does not contribute significantly to the SPT-3G survey intensity map. Measured satellite positions are found to be discrepant from their two-line element (TLE) derived ephemerides up to several arcminutes which may present a difficulty in cross-checking or masking satellites from short-duration transient searches.</description>
