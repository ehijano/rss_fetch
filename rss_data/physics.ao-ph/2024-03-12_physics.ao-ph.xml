      <title>The influence of orography and the direction of prevailing winds on precipitation distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general circulation of the atmosphere (GCA) carries out a constant and unidirectional transfer of air masses, therefore its influence is manifested in the distribution of precipitation around the globe due to the occurrence of rain shadow behind mountain barriers. Over the territory of Russia, GCA manifests itself in the form of westerly winds, which cause a decrease in precipitation on the leeward side of the Ural Mountains and the Central Siberian Plateau. The contribution of the orographic component to the spatial variability of precipitation on average reaches 50-60% of the monthly precipitation amounts. Forecasting the magnitude of the orographic effect is close to predicting the transfer rates in GCA, the measurement of which has not yet been satisfactorily provided. A possible promising way to solve the problem is to develop special algorithms similar to those used for detecting Madden-Julian oscillations.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Thermal Structure in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer During Evening Transition and the Impact of Aerosols on Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have explored the evening transition using data from eighty days of observations across two fog seasons at the Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru (KIAB). Through field experiments and simulations integrating aerosol interaction in a radiation-conduction model, we elucidate the impact of aerosols on longwave cooling of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL). Field observations indicate that under calm and clear-sky conditions, the evening transition typically results in a distinct vertical thermal structure called the Lifted Temperature Minimum (LTM). We observe that the prevailing profile near the surface post-sunset is the LTM-profile. Additionally, the occurrence of LTM is observed to increase with decreases in downward and upward longwave flux, soil sensible heat flux, wind speed, and turbulent kinetic energy measured at two meters above ground level (AGL). In such scenarios, the intensity of LTM-profiles is primarily governed by aerosol-induced longwave heating rate (LHR) within the surface layer. Furthermore, the presence of clouds leads to increased downward flux, causing the disappearance of LTM, whereas shallow fog can enhance LTM intensity, as observed in both field observations and simulations. Usually, prevailing radiation models underestimate aerosol-induced longwave heating rate (LHR) by an order, compared to actual field observations. We attribute this difference to aerosol-induced radiation divergence. We show that impact of aerosol-induced LHR extends hundreds of meters into the inversion layer, affecting temperature profiles and potentially influencing processes such as fog formation. As the fog layer develops, LHR strengthens at its upper boundary, however, we highlight the difficulty in detecting this cooling using remote instruments such as microwave radiometer.</description>

      <title>ExoCubed: A Riemann-Solver based Cubed-Sphere Dynamic Core for Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.</description>
