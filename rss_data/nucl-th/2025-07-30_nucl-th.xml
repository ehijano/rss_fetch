      <title>Two-neutrino $\beta\beta$ decay to excited states at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two-neutrino double-beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) into first-excited $0^+_2$ states of nuclei used in $\beta\beta$ decay experiments, including $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe. We calculate the corresponding nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) within the nuclear shell model, using various Hamiltonians that describe well the spectroscopy of the initial and final nuclei. We evaluate the next-to-leading order (NLO) long-range NMEs recently introduced within chiral effective field theory, keeping three terms in the expansion of the energy denominator. In most cases, NLO contributions to the half-life are below 5%, but they can increase to 25% due to cancellations in the leading-order Gamow-Teller NME. A detailed analysis in terms of nuclear deformation, including triaxiality, indicates that larger deformation differences between the initial and final states generally lead to smaller NMEs, but the seniority structure of the states also plays a relevant role. The lower range of our predicted half-lives, with uncertainties dominated by the nuclear Hamiltonian used, are slightly longer than the current experimental limit in $^{76}$Ge and the very recent half-life indication in $^{82}$Se.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutron-proton effective mass splitting through nuclear giant dipole resonance within transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, we investigate the effects of the isovector nucleon effective mass $m^*_{v,0}$ and the in-medium nucleon-nucleon cross section $\sigma^*$ on the isovector giant dipole resonance~(IVGDR) in $^{208}{\rm Pb}$, employing a set of representative Skyrme energy density functionals. We find that the energy-weighted sum rule $m_1$ of the IVGDR is highly sensitive to $m^{*}_{v,0}$ and only mildly dependent on $\sigma^*$, while the width $\Gamma$ of the IVGDR is primarily governed by $\sigma^*$ with a moderate sensitivity to $m^*_{v,0}$. From a Bayesian analysis of both $m_1$ and $\Gamma$, we infer the isovector effective mass $m^{*}_{v,0}/m$ = $0.731^{+0.027}_{-0.023}$, where $m$ is the bare nucleon mass. Furthermore, by incorporating the isoscalar effective mass $m^*_{s,0}/m = 0.820 \pm 0.030$, extracted from the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonance in $^{208}{\rm Pb}$, the linear neutron-proton effective mass splitting coefficient at saturation density $\rho_0$ is determined to be $\Delta m^*_1 (\rho_0)/m = 0.200 ^{+0.101}_{-0.094}$.</description>

      <title>Hadron Production Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimental search for the pion -- proposed in 1935 by Hideki Yukawa as the force carrier of the strong nucleon-nucleon interaction -- was rewarded in 1947 when in cosmic ray photographic emulsion data a charged particle was identified with the proper mass of about 300 times the electron mass, completed three years later by the discovery of the neutral pion. Since then, accelerator-driven pion and meson (photo-)production on the nucleon and the associated production of new baryons have become the key elements for ground-breaking discoveries in numerous areas of particle and nuclear physics, from fundamental symmetries and their breaking to low-energy QCD dynamics, laying also foundations for modern elementary particle physics and the Standard Model. This article is an overview of eight decades of experimental and theoretical meson production physics, from isospin to charm and beyond, forming our understanding of hadrons and their interactions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon in the Skyrme model based on scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the QCD scale anomaly in the gravitational form factors of the nucleon -- particularly the $D(t)$ form factor -- as well as the associated stress distribution and internal forces, using a Skyrme model based on the scale-invariant chiral perturbation theory. A distinctive feature of this model is the inclusion of both the pion and the scalar meson, which respectively capture the effects of the current quark mass and gluonic quantum contributions to the scale anomaly. By varying the mass of the scalar meson, we evaluate the sensitivity of the gluonic scale anomaly to the nucleon properties. We find that the gluonic scale anomaly plays a crucial role in satisfying the stability conditions of the nucleon and provides an internal confining force. Moreover, we also evaluate the momentum-transfer dependence of $D(t)$, which closely reproduces the lattice QCD results. With an appropriate choice of the anomalous dimension associated with the quark mass, its forward-limit value (i.e., the D-term) also matches the lattice data well.</description>

      <title>QCD-Gravity double copy in Regge asymptotics: from $2\rightarrow n$ amplitudes to radiation in shockwave collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss multi-particle production in QCD and in gravity at ultrarelativistic energies, their double copy relations, and strong parallels in emergent shockwave dynamics. Dispersive techniques are applied to derive the BFKL equation for multi-gluon production in Regge asymptotics. Identical methods apply in gravity and are captured by a gravitational Lipatov equation. The building blocks in both cases are Lipatov vertices and reggeized propagators satisfying double copy relations; in gravity, Weinberg's soft theorem is recovered as a limit of the Lipatov framework. BFKL evolution in QCD generates wee parton states of maximal occupancy characterized by an emergent semi-hard saturation scale. A Color Glass Condensate EFT, and renormalization group equations in this framework, describe wee parton correlations, and their rapidity evolution. A shockwave picture of deeply inelastic scattering and hadron-hadron collisions follows, with multi-particle production described by Cutkosky's rules in strong time-dependent fields. Gluon radiation in this framework has a double copy in gravitational shockwave collisions, with a similar correspondence applicable to gluon and graviton shockwave propagators. Possible extensions of this double copy are outlined for computing multi-particle production in gravitational shockwave collisions, self-force and tidal contributions, and classical and quantum noise in the focusing of geodesics.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics with multiple charges and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Molecules and $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ Coupled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21672v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm exotic mesons based on a coupled-channel framework, where the physical states are described as superpositions of a compact $c\bar c$ core (identified with the $\chi_{cJ}(2P)$ states) and hadronic components such as $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$. We incorporate meson exchange potentials to describe hadron-hadron interactions and determine model parameters to reproduce the observed masses of $X(3872)$ and $Z(3930)$. The model also predicts a $0^{++}$ bound state consistent with the $X(3860)$. The internal structure is found to be predominantly molecular for the $X(3872)$, while the $X(3860)$ and $Z(3930)$ have larger $c\bar{c}$ components. The coupling between $c\bar{c}$ cores and hadronic components plays a crucial role in generating these states. The resulting wave functions provide insight into the internal structure and decay properties of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Net-Charge Fluctuations in Finite Volume PNJL Model: A Probe for the QCD Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD Critical Point is a pivotal feature of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter. Signatures of the critical point are expected to manifest through the non-monotonic behavior of higher-order moments of conserved quantities, such as net-baryon ($\Delta B$), net-charge ($\Delta Q$), and net-strangeness ($\Delta S$), as a function of collision energy. These moments are connected to the thermodynamic susceptibilities, as well as to the correlation length developed in the system, which diverges at the critical point. The non-monotonic behavior of higher-order moments and their volume-independent products near the critical region supports the presence of a critical point in a finite system existing for a finite time, due to their sensitivity to critical fluctuations. These fluctuations are believed to provide key evidence in the search for the QCD Critical Point. We present the higher order moments, such as mean (M), variance $(\sigma^2)$, skewness (S), and kurtosis $(\kappa)$ and their volume-independent moment products $(M/\sigma^{2}, s\sigma, \kappa\sigma^{2})$ of net-charge multiplicity distributions in the three-flavor finite volume, finite density Polyakov loop enhanced Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model. The work has been performed at energies similar to RHIC BES energies from 7.7 GeV to 200 GeV, including 2.4 and 3 GeV in the present model. Our findings are compared with the STAR net-charge data at various collision energies to explore signals of the QCD critical point. Additionally, we contrast our results with predictions from the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model, the Hadron Resonance Gas (HRG) model, and available lattice QCD data. The present results offer a useful tool for extracting the freeze-out parameters in the heavy-ion collision by comparing them with the STAR net-charge result and other net-charge theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Shape evolution in neutron-rich odd-even $^{105-109}$Nb isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21806v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron-rich nuclei around $Z\sim40$ exhibit multiple shape transitions. This region shows one of the sharpest transitions in the nuclear chart, from a spherical vibrator at $N=58$ to a strongly deformed prolate shape at $N=60$, with largest deformations seen for $_{38}$Sr and $_{40}$Zr. Below $Z=36$, a spherical-to-oblate transition is predicted, while above $Z=42$ and $N\ge60$, the shape evolves from axial to triaxial. Even-$Z$ nuclei have been well studied, but odd-$Z$ isotopes such as Nb offer additional insights into these mechanisms. The Nb isotopes lie at the boundary between axially deformed Zr and triaxially deformed Mo nuclei. This work explores the structure of neutron-rich Nb nuclei up to $N=68$, aiming to understand shape evolution with isospin and the onset of triaxiality. Two complementary fission experiments were used: (i) $^{238}$U+$^9$Be at GANIL in inverse kinematics with AGATA, EXOGAM, and VAMOS++, allowing prompt and delayed $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with isotopic identification; (ii) spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf with the Gammasphere array providing high-fold $\gamma$-coincidence data. The level scheme of $^{105}$Nb was significantly extended with two new negative-parity bands. A revised scheme is proposed for $^{107}$Nb, differing from previous results, and new structures are reported in $^{109}$Nb. The signature splitting analysis indicates triaxial deformation for positive-parity bands, while negative-parity bands show axial symmetry, similar to Zr. This reveals a shape coexistence in neutron-rich Nb nuclei.</description>

      <title>Neutrino non-radiative decay in matter: constraints and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos, being massive, can decay. A heavier neutrino could decay into a lighter one and a massless scalar or pseudoscalar boson, such as the Majoron. Two-body non-radiative decay could occur in dense matter, such as in the inner dense regions of a core-collapse supernova. We first derive novel bounds on neutrino-Majoron couplings using the spectral distortions induced by neutrino non-radiative two-body decay in matter, and two-dimensional likelihood analyses of the 24 $\bar{\nu}_e$ events from SN1987A. We then explore the prospects of neutrino-Majoron couplings from a future galactic core-collapse supernova, leaving either a neutron star or a black-hole. To this aim, we use information from detailed one-dimensional supernova simulations. We consider the supernova neutrino signal associated with inverse-beta decay in the upcoming JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors, with neutrino-argon scattering in DUNE, or with coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering in the DARWIN experiment. In a full 3$\nu$ framework, based on the spectral distortions induced by neutrino decay in matter, we perform two-dimensional likelihood analyses and provide prospects for the limits on neutrino-Majoron couplings. Our results show that the observation of a future supernova will significantly improve on the current bounds, in particular from SN1987A and neutrinoless double-beta decay. Finally, we explore the impact of neutrino decay in matter on the diffuse supernova neutrino background formed by past supernova explosions. We show for the first time that the effects on black-hole contributions are important and modify the DSNB number of events by several tens of percent in Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Effect of Coriolis Force on Diffusion of D Meson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have attempted to calculate and estimate the spatial diffusion coefficients of D meson through rotating hadron resonance gas, which can be produced in the late stage of peripheral heavy ion collisions. Employing the framework of kinetic theory in relaxation time approximation, and using Einstein's diffusion relation, one can express the spatial diffusion coefficients of D meson as a ratio of its conductivity to its susceptibility. Here, we have tuned D meson relaxation time from the knowledge of earlier works on its spatial diffusion estimations, and then we have extended the framework for the finite rotation picture of hadronic matter, where only the effect of Coriolis force is considered. Our study also revealed the anisotropic nature of diffusion in the presence of rotation with future possibilities of phenomenological signature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08882v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the chiral phase transition relevant for QCD matter at finite temperature but with vanishing baryon density. Presumably, the chiral phase transition is of second order for two-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. Near the transition temperature, we apply the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and construct a low-energy effective field theory for the system, in which fluctuations and dissipations are systematically captured. The dynamical variables involve the chiral charge densities and order parameter (chiral condensate). Via the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh technique, the effective action is further confirmed within a modified AdS/QCD model. With higher-order terms suitably neglected, the stochastic equations derived from the effective field theory resemble those of model F in the Hohenberg-Halperin classification. Within the effective field theory, we briefly discuss the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and Goldstone modes.</description>

      <title>Suppression of elliptic anisotropy inside jets: A new perspective for jet quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle azimuthal anisotropies inside jets, defined within the momentum plane perpendicular to the jet axis, carry the information of the QCD cascade process for jet formation. In this work, we propose to measure the medium-induced modifications of the elliptic anisotropy inside jets in relativistic heavy-ion collisions to provide novel insight into the jet quenching phenomenon. By simulating the jet propagation in the hot and dense nuclear medium with a Linear Boltzmann Transport model, we observe a de-correlation in the two-particle azimuthal angular distribution for inclusive jet production in AA collisions relative to that in pp collisions, which results in significant suppression of the in-jet elliptic anisotropy coefficient $v_2$. This phenomenon arises from the stochastic and strong interactions with the thermal QGP medium undergone by the jet particles. Furthermore, the nuclear modifications of the in-jet $v_2$ are found to be sensitive to the medium properties in the model study, which provide a potential probe for the jet tomography of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Compton Form Factor Extraction using Quantum Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an extraction of Compton Form Factors (CFFs) from Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) experiments conducted at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, utilizing Quantum Deep Neural Networks (QDNNs). The analysis employs the standard Belitsky, Kirchner, and M\"uller formalism at twist-two, complemented by a fitting procedure designed to minimize model dependence in a manner analogous to conventional local fits. A pseudodata extraction test of the CFFs is performed using both Classical Deep Neural Networks (CDNNs) and QDNNs, with a detailed comparative analysis. Results indicate that QDNNs can outperform CDNNs in particular cases, offering enhanced predictive accuracy and precision even with limited model complexity. Motivated by this, we develop a metric to quantify the extent of the quantum advantage based on characteristics of DVCS experimental data. These findings underscore the promising role of QDNNs in advancing future investigations into multidimensional parton distributions and hadronic physics.</description>

      <title>Improved superscaling description of electron and charged-current neutrino quasielastic scattering using effective mass dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved version of the Superscaling Analysis with Relativistic Effective Mass, denoted as SuSAM-v2. In the original SuSAM model, a universal scaling function was fitted to a selected set of quasielastic electron scattering (e,e') cross section data, using a phenomenological ansatz inspired by the Relativistic Mean Field model of nuclear matter. In this work, we refine the procedure by first fitting a longitudinal scaling function directly to experimental longitudinal response data. Subsequently, a separate transverse scaling function is extracted from purely transverse data, after subtracting the longitudinal contribution already determined. We find that the resulting transverse scaling function must exhibit an explicit dependence on the momentum transfer q in order to reproduce all kinematics consistently. The resulting SuSAM-v2 model simultaneously describes inclusive quasielastic cross sections and both longitudinal and transverse response functions in electron scattering. The model is then applied to neutrino-nucleus scattering, showing an improved prediction compared to the previous SuSAM-v1 version, due to a more accurate treatment of the relative contributions of the longitudinal and transverse weak nuclear responses.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <title>Low-energy atomic scattering: s-wave relation between the interaction potential and the phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the on-shell approximation in the context of s-wave scattering for ultracold two-body collisions. Our analysis systematically covers spatial dimensions D=1,2,3 , with the aim of identifying the regimes in which the approximation remains valid when applied to commonly used model interaction potentials. Specifically, we focus on the square well and delta shell potentials, both of which admit analytical solutions for the s-wave scattering problem in all dimensions considered. By employing the exact analytical expressions for the s-wave scattering phase shift, we perform a direct comparison between the exact on-shell matrix element of the interaction potential and their corresponding approximations across a range of collision momenta. Particular attention is given to the low-energy regime. Our findings indicate that, although the on-shell approximation generally improves with increasing momentum, its accuracy also improves for weaker potentials. Remarkably, in the limit of weak interactions, we demonstrate that the on-shell approximation becomes exact at leading order. In this regime, the approximation offers a controlled means of deriving the low-momentum expansion of the potential and may serve as a useful tool in constructing effective interactions for quantum field theories.</description>
