      <title>On a Rokhlin property for abelian group actions on C$^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the so-called abelian Rokhlin property for actions of locally compact, abelian groups on C$^*$-algebras. We propose a unifying framework for obtaining various duality results related to this property. The abelian Rokhlin property coincides with the known Rokhlin property for actions by the reals (i.e., flows), but is not identical to the known Rokhlin property in general. The main duality result we obtain is a generalisation of a duality for flows proved by Kishimoto in the case of Kirchberg algebras. We consider also a slight weakening of the abelian Rokhlin property, which allows us to show that all traces on the crossed product C$^*$-algebra are canonically induced from invariant traces on the the coefficient C$^*$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Quadratic subproduct systems, free products, and their C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the interplay between quadratic algebras, noncommutative geometry, and operator theory, we introduce the notion of quadratic subproduct systems of Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we study the subproduct systems induced by a finite number of complex quadratic polynomials in noncommuting variables, and describe their Toeplitz and Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. Inspired by the theory of graded associative algebras, we define a free product operation in the category of subproduct systems and show that this corresponds to the reduced free product of the Toeplitz algebras. Finally, we obtain results about the K-theory of the Toeplitz and Cuntz--Pimsner algebras of a large class of quadratic subproduct systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical relationship between CAR algebras and determinantal point processes: point processes at finite temperature and stochastically positive KMS systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we develop the author's previous work on the dynamical relationship between determinantal point processes and CAR algebras. Secondly, we present a novel application of the theory of stochastic processes associated with KMS states for CAR algebras and their quasi-free states. Lastly, we propose a unified theory of algebraic constructions and analysis of stationary processes on point configuration spaces with respect to determinantal point processes. As a byproduct, we establish an algebraic derivation of a determinantal formula for space-time correlations of stochastic processes, and we analyze several limiting behaviors of these processes.</description>

      <title>A characterization of $C^*$-simplicity of countable groups via Poisson boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize $C^*$-simplicity for countable groups by means of the following dichotomy. If a group is $C^*$-simple, then the action on the Poisson boundary is essentially free for a generic measure on the group. If a group is not $C^*$-simple, then the action on the Poisson boundary is not essentially free for a generic measure on the group.</description>

      <title>Wreath-like products of groups and their von Neumann algebras II: Outer automorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a countable group $G$, let ${\rm L}(G)$ denote its von Neumann algebra. For a wide class of ICC groups with Kazhdan's property (T), we confirm a conjecture of V.F.R. Jones asserting that $Out(\text{L}(G))\cong Char (G)\rtimes Out(G)$. As an application, we show that, for every countable group $Q$, there exists an ICC group $G$ with property (T) such that $Out(\text{L}(G))\cong Q$.</description>

      <title>Diagonal comparison of ample C*-diagonals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce diagonal comparison, a regularity property of diagonal pairs where the sub-C*-algebra has totally disconnected spectrum, and establish its equivalence with the concurrence of strict comparison of the ambient C*-algebra and dynamical comparison of the underlying dynamics induced by the partial action of the normalisers. As an application, we show that for diagonal pairs arising from principal minimal transformation groupoids with totally disconnected unit space, diagonal comparison is equivalent to tracial Z-stability of the pair and that it is implied by finite diagonal dimension.
  In-between, we show that any projection of the diagonal sub-C*-algebra can be uniformly tracially divided, and explore a property of conditional expectations onto abelian sub-C*-algebras, namely containment of every positive element in the hereditary subalgebra generated by its conditional expectation. We show that the expectation associated to a C*-pair with finite diagonal dimension is always hereditary in that sense, and we give an example where this property does not occur.</description>

      <title>Strict comparison in reduced group $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that for every $n\geq 2$, the reduced group $C^*$-algebras of the countable free groups $C^*_r(\mathbb{F}_n)$ have strict comparison. Our method works in a general setting: for $G$ in a large family of non-amenable groups, including hyperbolic groups, free products, mapping class groups, right-angled Artin groups etc., we have $C^*_r(G)$ have strict comparison. This work also has several applications in the theory of $C^*$-algebras including: resolving Leonel Robert's selflessness problem for $C^*_r(G)$; uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang-Su algebra $\mathcal{Z}$ up to approximate unitary equivalence into $C^*_r(G)$; full computations of the Cuntz semigroup of $C^*_r(G)$ and future directions in the $C^*$-classification program.</description>

      <title>Essential groupoid amenability and nuclearity of groupoid C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an alternative construction of the essential $C^*$-algebra of an \'etale groupoid, along with an ``amenability'' notion for such groupoids that is implied by the nuclearity of this essential $C^*$-algebra. In order to do this we first introduce a maximal version of the essential $C^*$-algebra, and prove that every function with dense co-support can only be supported on the set of ``dangerous'' arrows. We then introduce an essential amenability condition for a groupoid, which is (strictly) weaker than its (topological) amenability. As an application, we describe the Bruce-Li algebras arising from algebraic actions of cancellative semigroups as exotic essential $C^*$-algebras.</description>

      <title>Negative resolution to the $C^*$-algebraic Tarski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the $K_1$-group of ultraproducts of unital, simple $C^*$-algebras with unique trace and strict comparison. As an application, we prove that the reduced free group $C^*$-algebras $C^*_r(F_m)$ and $C^*_r(F_n)$ are elementarily equivalent (i.e., have isomorphic ultrapowers) if and only if $m = n$. This settles in the negative the $C^*$-algebraic analogue of Tarski's 1945 problem for groups.</description>

      <title>Twisted Steinberg algebras, regular inclusions and induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a field $K$ and an ample (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $G$, we define the concept of a line bundle over $G$ inspired by the well known concept from the theory of C*-algebras. If $E$ is such a line bundle, we construct the associated twisted Steinberg algebra in terms of sections of $E$, which turns out to extend the original construction introduced independently by Steinberg in 2010, and by Clark, Farthing, Sims and Tomforde in a 2014 paper (originally announced in 2011). We also generalize (strictly, in the non-Hausdorff case) the 2023 construction of (cocycle) twisted Steinberg algebras of Armstrong, Clark, Courtney, Lin, Mccormick and Ramagge. We then extend Steinberg's theory of induction of modules, not only to the twisted case, but to the much more general case of regular inclusions of algebras. Our main result shows that, under appropriate conditions, every irreducible module is induced by an irreducible module over a certain abstractly defined isotropy algebra.</description>
