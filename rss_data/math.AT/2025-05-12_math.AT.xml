      <title>Persistent Homology: A Pedagogical Introduction with Biological Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) is a fundamental tool in computational topology, designed to uncover the intrinsic geometric and topological features of data across multiple scales. Originating within the broader framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), PH has found diverse applications ranging from protein structure and knot analysis to financial domains such as Bitcoin behaviour and stock market dynamics. Despite its growing relevance, there remains a lack of accessible resources that bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementation for beginners. This paper offers a clear and comprehensive introduction to persistent homology, guiding readers from core concepts to real-world applications. Specifically, we illustrate the methodology through the analysis of a 3-1 supercoiled DNA structure. The paper is tailored for readers without prior exposure to algebraic topology, aiming to demystify persistent homology and foster its broader adoption in data analysis tasks.</description>

      <title>The real Betti realization of motivic Thom spectra and of very effective Hermitian K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real Betti realization is a symmetric monoidal functor from the category of motivic spectra to that of topological spectra, extending the functor that associates to a scheme over $\mathbb{R}$ the space of its real points. In this article, we prove some results about the real Betti realizations of certain motivic $\mathcal{E}_1$- and $\mathcal{E}_\infty$-rings. We show that the motivic Thom spectrum functor and the topological one correspond to each other, as symmetric monoidal functors, under real realization. In particular, we obtain equivalences of $\mathcal{E}_\infty$-rings between the real realizations of the variants $\mathsf{MGL}$, $\mathsf{MSL}$, and $\mathsf{MSp}$ of algebraic cobordism, and the variants $\mathsf{MO}$, $\mathsf{MSO}$, and $\mathsf{MU}$ of topological cobordism, respectively. Using this, we identify the $\mathcal{E}_1$-ring structure on the real realization of $\mathsf{ko}$, the very effective cover of Hermitian K-theory, by an explicit 2-local fracture square, as being equivalent to $\mathsf{L}(\mathbb{R})_{\geq 0}$, the connective L-theory spectrum of $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the independence complex for graph products where at least one of the factors is a path as well as the complexes for their induced subgraphs. We calculate the homotopy type of the independence complex of the graphs $P_n\times P_m$, $P_n\boxtimes P_2$, $P_n\boxtimes P_3$ and $P_n\boxtimes P_4$. We also focus in the independence complexes of the induced subgraphs of $P_n\times P_3$, $P_n\boxtimes P_2$, $P_n\boxtimes P_3$, $P_n\boxtimes P_4$ and some lexicographic products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we give a versal deformation for any transversely holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}_0$ given by the intersection of the orbits of a holomorphic vector field $\xi$ defined on a neighborhood of a set $M$ biholomorphic to a neighborhood of the closure of a bounded strongly convex open domain $\Omega \subset\mathbb C^n$ ($n\geq2$) of smooth boundary, with its boundary $\partial M$. That is, any germ of deformation of $\mathcal{F}_0$ is also obtained by intersecting the orbits of a deformation of $\xi$ with the boundary of $M$.</description>

      <title>Chern character and Fermi point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper expresses the Chern character for topological K-theory based on the formulation of the family of Fredholm operators, by using the points at which the Fredholm operator becomes singular (Fermi points). In particular, we explain that the odd Chern character can be thought of as a generalization of the spectral flow. As applications, we give elementary proofs of the evenness of the edge index and the bulk-edge correspondence for four-dimensional topological insulators with time-reversal symmetry of class AI.</description>

      <title>A Simple Computation of Teichm\"uller Polynomials from Integer Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple method to compute the Teichm\"uller polynomial of the fibered face of a hyperbolic $3$-manifold $M_\phi$ obtained as the mapping torus of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism $\phi$ of a closed surface. We assume $\phi$ has orientable invariant foliations and fixes each singular trajectory. We use a characterisation of such homeomorphisms in terms of a permutation of a finite set of integers to give a direct implementation of McMullens algorithm using train tracks. Train tracks with a single vertex suffice in this case. As an application, for each $p\in\mathbb{Z}_{\geq0}$, we find an infinite sequence of Teichm\"uller polynomials $\Theta_{g,p}$ associated to pseudo-Anosov maps on surfaces of genus $g\geq2$, such that the hyperbolic 3-manifold obtained as the mapping torus has first Betti number $g$. These polynomials realize a positive proportion of bi-Perron units of each degree as pseudo-Anosov stretch-factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-monoids on which a prime $p$ acts invertibly, which we call $p$-perfect, in the non-group-complete situation. In particular, we prove that in many examples, they almost embed in their group-completion.
  We further study the $p$-perfection functor, and describe it in terms of Quillen's $+$-construction, similarly to group-completion. This gives an alternative description of the $p$-inverted higher algebraic $K$-theory of a ring.</description>

      <title>Plethysm Products, Element and Plus Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by viewing categories as bimodule monoids over their isomorphism groupoids, we construct monoidal structures called plethysm products on three levels: that is for bimodules, relative bimodules and factorizable bimodules. For the bimodules, we work in the general setting of actions by categories. We give a comprehensive theory linking these levels to each other as well as to Grothendieck element constructions, indexed enrichments, decorations and algebras.
  Specializing to groupoid actions leads to applications including the plus construction. In this setting, the third level encompasses the known constructions of Baez-Dolan and its generalizations, as we prove. One new result is that that the plus construction can also be realized an element construction compatible with monoidal structures that we define. This allows us to prove a commutativity between element and plus constructions a special case of which was announced earlier. Specializing the results on the third level yield a criterion, when a definition of operad-like structure as a plethysm monoid -- as exemplified by operads -- is possible.</description>

Abstract: We provide a unifying approach to different constructions of the algebraic $K$-theory of equivariant symmetric monoidal categories. A consequence of our work is that every connective genuine $G$-spectrum is equivalent to the equivariant algebraic $K$-theory of categorical Mackey functors of Bohmann-Osorno.</description>

      <title>Homology Generators and Relations for the Ordered Configuration Space of a Star Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the ordered configuration spaces of star graphs. Inspired by the representation stability results of Church--Ellenberg--Farb for the ordered configuration space of a manifold and the edge stability results of An--Drummond-Cole--Knudsen for the unordered configuration space of a graph, we determine how the ordered configuration space of a star graph with $k$ leaves behaves as we add particles at the leaves. We show that, as a module over the combinatorial category FI$_{k, o}$, the first homology of this ordered configuration space is finitely generated by $4$ particles for $k=3$, by $3$ particles for $k=4$, and by $2$ particles for $k\ge 5$. Additionally, we prove that every relation among homology classes can be described by relations on at most $6$ particles for $k=4$, at most $5$ particles when $k=5$, at most $4$ particles when $k=6$, and at most $3$ particles for $k\ge 7$, while proving that adding particles always introduces new relations when $k=3$. This proves that there is no finite universal presentation for the homology of ordered configuration spaces of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides an introduction to decomposition spaces and 2-Segal spaces, unifying the two perspectives. We begin by defining decomposition spaces using the active-inert factorization system on the simplicial category, and show their equivalence to 2-Segal spaces. Key results include the path space criterion, which characterizes decomposition spaces in terms of their upper and lower d\'ecalages, and the edgewise subdivision criterion. We also introduce free decomposition spaces arising from outer face complexes, providing a rich source of examples. Formal prerequisites are minimal -- readers should have a working knowledge of simplicial methods and basic category theory.</description>

      <title>Gyration Stability for Projective Planes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gyrations are operations on manifolds that arise in geometric topology, where a manifold $M$ may exhibit distinct gyrations depending on the chosen twisting. For a given $M$, we ask a natural question: do all gyrations of $M$ share the same homotopy type regardless of the twisting? A manifold with this property is said to have gyration stability. Inspired by recent work by Duan, which demonstrated that the quaternionic projective plane is not gyration stable with respect to diffeomorphism, we explore this question for projective planes in general. We obtain a complete description of gyration stability for the complex, quaternionic, and octonionic projective planes up to homotopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a cochain complex for ample groupoids $\mathcal G$ using a flat resolution defining their homology with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$. We prove that the cohomology of this cochain complex with values in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ coincides with the previously introduced continuous cocycle cohomology of $\mathcal G$. In particular, this groupoid cohomology is invariant under Morita equivalence. We derive an exact sequence for the cohomology of skew products by a $\mathbb Z$-valued cocycle. We indicate how to compute the cohomology with coefficients in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ for $AF$-groupoids and for certain action groupoids.</description>
