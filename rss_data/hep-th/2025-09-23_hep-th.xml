      <title>Quantized Giant Gravitons as the Periodic Table of Supersymmetric States: D3, M2 and M5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider giant gravitons in the probe approximation when they are described by classical brane configurations in AdS$_{p+2}\times S^{q+2}$ wrapping a particular $q$-cycle and spinning in $S^{q+2}$. We quantize the full set of fluctuations of these configurations and show that they are sufficient to capture all the supersymmetric single-letter partition functions of the dual field theory. We explicitly discuss the cases of D3, M2 and M5 branes and reproduce the single-letter indices for all fractions of supersymmetry. We also provide a new derivation of the full finite-$N$ half-BPS index by promoting certain fluctuations to matrix-valued fields. We elaborate on the obstructions for the general finite-$N$ computations. Given that the single-letter partition functions are the building blocks of all supersymmetric enumerations, including for the black hole entropy, our work provides a direct gravitational counting of those degrees of freedom modulo finite-$N$ obstacles due to non-Abelian effects.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping transport in the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model is a simple low energy and long wavelength description of charge transport, parameterised by the current relaxation timescale $\tau$, charge diffusivity $D$ and charge compressibility $\chi$. We obtain sharp constraints on these parameters in terms of the microscopic energy and length scales of any underlying lattice model with local and bounded interactions. Our primary tools are upper bounds on the retarded Green's function for the charge density in such a setting. We first note that the Drude-Kadanoff-Martin model cannot pertain at microscopic energy scales because it is inconsistent with the exponential suppression of spectral weight at the highest frequencies in a lattice model. Secondly, under the assumption that the low energy dynamics is captured by the model, we obtain a lower bound on the collective mean free path $\ell \equiv \sqrt{\tau D}$. This bound is shown to imply a version of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel bound: systems with $\ell$ much shorter than the lattice length scale cannot have conventional Drude peaks.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization in 1+1-Dimensional SU(2) Lattice Gauge Theory Coupled with Dynamical Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in 1+1-dimensional SU(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with one flavor of dynamical fermions. Using the loop-string-hadron framework of the LGT with a bosonic cut-off, we exactly diagonalize the Hamiltonian for finite size systems and calculate matrix elements (MEs) in the eigenbasis for both local and non-local operators. We analyze different indicators to identify the parameter space for quantum chaos at finite lattice sizes and investigate how the ETH behavior emerges in both the diagonal and off-diagonal MEs. Our investigations allow us to study various time scales of thermalization and the emergence of random matrix behavior, and highlight the interplays of the several diagnostics with each other. Furthermore, from the off-diagonal MEs, we extract a smooth function that is closely related to the spectral function for both local and non-local operators. We find numerical evidence of the spectral gap and the memory peak in the non-local operator case. Finally, we investigate aspects of subsystem ETH in the lattice gauge theory and identify certain features in the subsystem reduced density matrix that are unique to gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Towards the Parametric Renormalization of the S-matrix - I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zimmermann's forest formula is the corner stone of perturbative renormalization in QFT. By renormalizing individual Feynman graphs, it generates the UV finite S-matrix. This approach to renormalization makes the graph and all its forests center pieces in the theory of renormalization. On the other hand the positive geometry program delegate the role of Feynman graphs as secondary to the amplitude itself, which are generated by canonical forms associated to positive geometries. State of the art in this program is the convergence of S-matrix theory in local QFTs and string theory as the scattering amplitudes in QFT arise as integrals over certain moduli spaces. These integrals are known as curve integrals. For theories such as $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ theory with massive colored scalars, these integrals are divergent in the UV and have to be regularized. It is then natural to ask if there is a ``forest-like formula'' for these integrals which produce a renormalized amplitude without needing to explicitly invoke the forests associated to divergent subgraphs. In this paper, we initiate such a program by deriving forest-like formula for planar massive $\textrm{Tr}(\Phi^{3})$ amplitudes in $D = 4$ dimensions. Our analysis relies on the insightful manifestation of the forest formula derived by Brown and Kreimer in \cite{Brown:2011pj}, that lead us to a definition of ``tropical counter-term'' for the bare amplitude.</description>

      <title>Cardy limit of the 3d superconformal index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the superconformal index $Z(q)$ of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories in Cardy-like limits $\beta = \log \tfrac{1}{q} \to 0^+$, extending techniques recently developed in the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ context. For theories with vectorlike matter content we find on the first sheet ($q \to 1$) that $Z(q) \sim \beta^{-\#}$, where the exponent $\#$ is determined by a $multiscale\ decomposition$ of the BPS moduli space appearing in the localization formula for the index. On the second sheet ($q \to e^{2\pi i})$ we find $Z(q) \sim e^{\#/ \beta}$, and that the long-standing puzzle of apparent gauge-enhancing saddles is resolved (in the absence of Chern--Simons couplings) via a novel $Lorentzian\ factorization$ formula that establishes complete screening.
  A key insight is the use of $Poisson\ resummation$, which streamlines the asymptotic analysis, sharpens the link to Kaluza--Klein effective field theory, and provides a dual description of parts of the BPS moduli space in terms of punctured surfaces. The Lorentzian factorization formula also emerges from Poisson resummation, though applied after a contour crossing in moduli space. This, in turn, hints at a correspondence between 3d monopoles and vortices via 2d duality.</description>

      <title>Toward an Effective Theory of the Volume Modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the 4-dimensional effective theory of the warped volume modulus in the presence of stabilizing effects from gaugino condensation by analyzing the linearized 10-dimensional supergravity equations of motion. Warping is generally expected to scale down the masses of bulk modes to the IR scale at the tip of a throat. We find that the mass of the warped volume modulus evades expectations and is largely insensitive to the effects of warping, even in strongly warped backgrounds. Instead, the mass is parametrically tied to the 4-dimensional AdS curvature scale $m^2 \sim {\mathcal O}(1) |\hat R_{\rm AdS}|$, presenting a challenge for scale separation in these backgrounds. We trace this effect to a universal contribution arising from the 10-dimensional equations of motion, and comment on the importance of a 10-dimensional treatment of the warped volume modulus for effective field theories and model building.</description>

      <title>SYK collective field theory as complex Liouville gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a precise relationship between the $G\Sigma$ collective field theory of the double scaled SYK model and the worldsheet theory of the complex Liouville string a.k.a. sine dilaton gravity. The relationship is similar to the lightcone gauge in critical string theory, and to what transpires when we gravitationally dress to an observer in gravity: one of the Liouville fields plays the role of a dynamical clock with respect to which the second Liouville field evolves. This other Liouville field is identified with the collective field of SYK, which thus acquires a direct gravity interpretation. The relevant 2D worldsheet geometry is that of a disk with specific crosscap and FZZT boundary conditions, as deduced from the $G\Sigma$ formulation. We compute the CLS amplitude on this geometry and find that this coincides with the DSSYK partition function. We indicate how our results can be lifted to 3D gravity, previewing upcoming work. An outflow of our results is that physical operators of DSSYK are mapped to holonomy operators (Verlinde lines) of complex Liouville theory on the crosscap geometry, which in turn have a 3D representation in terms of line operators in 3D de Sitter gravity. We show that the partition function of SYK can be represented as the expectation value of a circular gravitational Wilson line on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ (a.k.a. elliptic 3D de Sitter space).</description>

      <title>Modular Hamiltonians for future-perturbed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a perturbative understanding of the modular Hamiltonian for a 2D CFT, divided into left and right half-spaces, with a weak local perturbation inserted in the future wedge. A formal perturbation series for the modular Hamiltonian is available, but must be properly interpreted in quantum field theory. We work inside correlation functions with spectator operators, and introduce a prescription for defining complex modular flow via analytic continuation to properly resolve singularities. From the correlators, we extract an operator expression for the modular Hamiltonian. It takes the form of a local operator in the future wedge plus contact terms with an unconventional singularity structure. Thanks to this structure the KMS conditions are satisfied, which independently establishes the validity of the results. Similar techniques apply to perturbations inserted in the past wedge. We mention various future directions, including an all-orders speculation for the excited state modular Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos and pole skipping in two-dimensional conformal perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze pole skipping in two-dimensional field theories perturbed away from conformality by a relevant deformation. The leading-order correction to the retarded Green's function can be formally computed in conformal perturbation theory, though it results in singular expressions. We suggest a natural interpretation of these expressions and compute the resulting Green's function to leading nontrivial order in the deformation. As a check of our results, we compare the skipped poles we find to the butterfly velocity obtained from a holographic gravitational dual perturbed by a massive scalar field; we find precise agreement. We comment on extensions to subleading order, where agreement with holographic expectations would no longer be expected.</description>

      <title>One loop aspects of Coleman de Luccia instantons at small backreaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Euclidean path integral around Coleman de Luccia instantons. We compute their contribution at the one-loop level, at leading order in the small backreaction limit. At this level of approximation, their contribution factorizes into a pure gravity and a pure matter contribution. In deriving this result, we also clarify what happens to some zero mode contributions to the path integral, once the symmetry responsible for them is broken. With these results established, we propose a formula for the decay rate of the false vacuum in terms of gravitational path integrals, and we show that our definition matches the usual quantum field theory result as $G_{N}\rightarrow0$. Lastly, we propose a prescription to study how the phase of the gravity+matter path integral changes as we change the parameters of the theory.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis for $Q$-balls with spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the spectral decomposition technique, we introduce a simple and universal numerical method to analyze the stability of solitons. Adopting this method, the linear dynamical properties of $Q$-balls are systematically revealed, from the fundamental to the excited states. For the fundamental $Q$-ball, the well-known stability criterion holds. However, for the excited $Q$-balls, the situation becomes extremely complicated, in which the stability criterion is violated. The system exhibits dynamical instability to both spherically symmetric and non-spherically symmetric perturbations, manifested in the appearance of complex and imaginary modes. In addition, we observe two interesting phenomena. One is that the oscillation mode and the complex or imaginary mode can transform into each other, marking the transition of the dynamical properties of the system. The other is the existence of excited $Q$-balls capable of resisting perturbations with low-order spherical harmonics. Such results indicate that the excited $Q$-balls will exhibit rich dynamical behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the generating function has been proposed as an alternative reduction method. This method has been tested at the one-loop level, including the tensor reduction and propagators with higher powers. In this work, we initiate the study of the method for higher loops by focusing on the sunset diagram, which is the simplest nontrivial two-loop integral. By employing PV reduction equations together with syzygy equations, we construct a complete system of differential equations. Through series expansion, we derive a complete set of recurrence relations, which can efficiently reduce any high-rank tensor structure.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous results on the gravitational interactions for massive spin 5/2 particles and spin 3 particles to massive spin 7/2, including its massless and partially massless limits. These results share some common features, such as a non-singular massless limit in $AdS$ and a flat limit for non-zero masses, as well as a singularity at the points corresponding to the boundary of the unitary forbidden region. At the same time, these results allow us to suggest what the structure of non-minimal interactions for arbitrary spins looks like. Another subject of interest is the Skvortsov-Vasiliev formalism for describing partially massless fields. This formalism has been very useful in our research, but our examples have shown that it dos not always lead to the correct results.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Conserved Currents and Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fate of global symmetries at the late-time boundary of de Sitter space. In anti-de Sitter space, bulk gauge symmetries generally correspond to conserved global currents on the boundary. We show that in de Sitter space such currents tend to acquire anomalous dimensions due to multiplet recombination with composite operators, which is a consequence of the shadow structure of the boundary operator spectrum. As a result, global symmetries are generically (weakly) broken. This mechanism is transparent in the EAdS reformulation of dS late-time correlators given in arXiv:2007.09993 and arXiv:2109.02725, where Dirichlet modes mix with composites and acquire small masses, while Neumann modes remain protected by gauge invariance. We demonstrate this mechanism explicitly in scalar QED, Yang-Mills theory, and Einstein gravity, and argue that it extends to higher-spin and partially massless fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in two-dimensional Euclidean quantum gravity without matter fields, the Schwinger-Dyson equations derived within the Hamiltonian framework of non-critical string field theory can be reformulated in terms of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion, and we explicitly compute the associated low-order amplitudes. In particular, we establish this reformulation for two discrete models -- the basic type and the strip type -- as well as for the continuum limit of dynamical triangulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a general action for a particle in AdS$_3$ using the non-linear realization framework. Critical sectors are found and characterized in terms of the parameters appearing in the Lagrangian, generalizing the known results for AdS$_3$/SO(2). A study of the dynamics of this system and of the geometrical meaning of the new terms in the action is also undertaken.
  Using two chiral copies of the general AdS$_2$ Lagrangian, we obtain an AdS$_3$ Lagrangian which is the same, although expressed in different variables, that the general AdS$_3$ one, and from this one can identify the extra gauge transformations appearing in the critical sectors of the AdS$_3$ theory. A differential equation connecting the AdS$_2 \times$ AdS$_2$ chiral variables to the AdS$_3$ covariant ones is obtained, and it is explicitly solved at first order in the Goldstone bosons associated to boosts and rotations.</description>

      <title>Non-Lagrangian phases of matter from Wilsonian renormalization of 3D Wess-Zumino-Witten theory on Stiefel manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the renormalization of D-dimensional level-k Wess-Zumino-Witten theory with Stiefel-manifold target space $\mathrm{St}_{N,N-D-1} \cong \mathrm{SO}(N)/\mathrm{SO}(D+1)$, with a particular focus on $D = 3$. I investigate in particular whether such a theory admits IR-stable fixed points of the renormalization group flow. Such fixed points have been suggested to describe conformal phases of matter that do not have a known dual (super-)renormalizable Lagrangian for $N \geq 7$ in $D = 3$. They are hence of interest both from the point of view of quantum phases of matter as well as pure field theory. The $D$-dimensional expressions enable the computation, by analytic computation, of beta functions in $D = 2 + \epsilon$, at least to first non-trivial order. In $D = 2$, a stable fixed point is found, serving a generalization of the famed $\mathrm{SU}(2)_k$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory; it annihilates in $D = 2 + \epsilon$ with an unstable fixed point which splits off from the Gaussian one for $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Although the story is thus qualitatively similar to that of SO(5) deconfined (pseudo-)criticality, for $N \geqslant 6$, the annihilation appears to occur only for $\epsilon &gt; 1$, suggesting the existence of a stable phase in $D = 3$. Comparisons of the scaling dimension of the lowest singlet operator are made with known results for $N = 6$, which is dual to QED$_3$ with $N_\mathrm{f} = 4$ fermion flavors. The predictions for the $N = 7$ Stiefel liquid represent to my knowledge the first computation of this kind for a Wess-Zumino-Witten theory without a known gauge theory dual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores the correspondence between Chern-Simons theory and integrable field theories across different dimensions. It brings together all of my work in this area, including several distinct realizations of this correspondence. The thesis generalizes existing results on four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and holomorphic Chern-Simons theory on twistor space. Additionally, it presents the discovery of a novel correspondence between five-dimensional holomorphic 2-Chern-Simons theory and integrable field theories in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB Formulation of Quantization and Particle Production in Time-Dependent Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divergence in perturbative expansions is where interesting physics takes place. Particle production on time-dependent backgrounds, as one such example, is interpreted as transition from one vacuum to another. Vacuum is typically defined as an asymptotic state in which the WKB approximation is valid. The use of the WKB method, however, poses several conceptual and computational issues, as the WKB series is divergent in general, quantization is insensitive to higher orders in the series, and the global behavior of solutions cannot be captured. Exact WKB analysis is a powerful resummation technology that provides an analytical tool for a global structure of exact solutions to overcome these problems. In this paper, we establish quantization by fully employing the exact WKB solutions as mode functions and by defining the vacua with respect to them. We provide a self-contained exact WKB formulation to obtain evolution matrices without resorting to the use of known special functions and without approximations. We find that the quantity called Voros coefficient plays an important role to re-normalize the exact WKB solutions compatible with asymptotic states. We show that the ambiguity that coexists with nontrivial Voros coefficients is eliminated by requiring physical quantization conditions. Our formalism provides a conceptual as well as practical framework to upgrade our treatment of quantization and particle production. Combined with other approximating techniques, it can form a basis to tackle a broad class of problems that are beyond technical ability of the existing formulations.</description>

      <title>Analytical results for large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study large-$N_c$ scalar QCD$_2$, a $1+1$-dimensional confining gauge theory with fundamental scalar quarks, whose meson spectrum is governed by a Bethe-Salpeter equation structurally parallel to the 't Hooft equation. Exploiting this structural analogy, we develop a nonperturbative analytic framework, based on integrability and inspired by the Fateev-Lukyanov-Zamolodchikov (FLZ) method, originally devised for the 't Hooft model and later extended in our previous works. Notably, the same Bethe-Salpeter equation also arises in the description of interchain mesons in the doubled Ising model coupled via a spin-spin interaction term. Within the FLZ approach, we find spectral sums and derive a systematic large-$n$ WKB expansion for the meson spectrum. The analytic results reproduce the expected behavior in key asymptotic regimes, such as the near-critical limit $m\to g/\sqrt{\pi}$ and the heavy-quark regime $m\gg g$, and are in good agreement with numerical data. Finally, by analytically continuing the mass parameter into the complex plane, we uncover two infinite families of singularities where individual mesons become massless, suggesting a hidden connection to nontrivial Conformal Field Theories.</description>

      <title>On isomorphisms between quiver Yangians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiver Yangians are infinite-dimensional algebras capturing the BPS structure of a large class of supersymmetric models. Quiver theories related by Seiberg duality are expected to have isomorphic quiver Yangians, and this isomorphism has previously been shown for quivers corresponding to generalised conifold geometries. In this work, we present an explicit isomorphism for the two Seiberg dual phases of the F0 quiver theory, which falls outside of the above class. Some aspects of our construction are similar to the known cases, while others appear to be specific to the F0 quiver. In particular, the map involves square roots of operators bilinear in the fermionic fields of the mode being dualised.</description>

      <title>A converse theorem for hyperbolic surface spectra and the conformal bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conformal bootstrap in physics has recently been adapted to prove remarkably sharp estimates on Laplace eigenvalues and triple correlations of automorphic forms on compact hyperbolic surfaces. These estimates derive from an infinite family of algebraic equations satisfied by this spectral data. The equations encode $G$-equivariance and associativity of multiplication on $\Gamma \backslash G$, for $\Gamma$ a cocompact lattice in $G = \text{PSL}_2(\mathbf{R})$. The effectiveness of the conformal bootstrap suggests that the equations characterize hyperbolic surface spectra, i.e., that every solution to the equations comes from a compact hyperbolic surface. This paper proves this rigorously with no analytic assumptions on the solution except discreteness of the spectrum. The key intermediate result is an axiomatic characterization of representations of $G$ of the form $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.</description>

      <title>Counting Degrees of Freedom: A Method Applicable from Scalars to f(Q) Gravity and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a clear, step-by-step method for counting degrees of freedom and identifying constraints in general field theories. This approach, grounded in the works of Einstein, Hilbert, Cartan, Kuranishi, and, more recently, Seiler, is neither Lagrangian nor Hamiltonian in nature. Instead, it applies directly to the field equations. We offer a transparent physical interpretation of the method, establish new results, and explore a broad set of examples to demonstrate its power and generality. Notably, we apply the method to $f(\mathbb{Q})$ gravity, where traditional techniques such as the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm are ineffective, and obtain seven propagating degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Dirac Oscillator for Spin-1/2 Particles in a Spinning Cosmic String Spacetime with Spacelike Disclination and Dislocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Dirac oscillator for spin-1/2 particles in a spacetime containing a spinning cosmic string endowed with both curvature (disclination) and torsion (screw dislocation). The background geometry includes off-diagonal and is analyzed through a local tetrad formalism. Working in cylindrical coordinates, we derive the covariant Dirac equation and solve it exactly via a second-order differential equation for the lower spinor component. Three distinct physical configurations are examined: (i) balanced torsion where temporal and spatial contributions are equal, (ii) purely temporal torsion (spinning string), and (iii) purely spatial torsion (screw dislocation). In all cases, we obtain exact energy spectra expressed in terms of effective angular quantum numbers that depend on the oscillator frequency, the angular deficit parameter \alpha , the torsional parameters J_{t} and J_{z}, and the longitudinal momentum k. The resulting energy levels generalize the flat-spacetime Moshinsky oscillator spectrum by incorporating energy- and momentum-dependent shifts due to the background geometry. We show that curvature and torsion lift degeneracies and induce nontrivial modifications to the angular structure of the solutions. The flat-space spectrum is recovered as a special limit when both curvature and torsion vanish. This work provides a fully solvable model that illustrates how spacetime defects affect relativistic quantum systems, offering insights relevant to both high-energy physics and condensed-matter analogs.</description>

      <title>Dilepton Production in a Rotating Thermal Medium Part I: The Rigid Rotation Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate dilepton production in a thermalized quark--gluon plasma subject to global rotation, in the rigid rotating approximation. We consider a generic process involving quark-antiquark annihilation, followed by the emission of a highly energetic virtual photon decaying into a dilepton pair. For this process, we compute the dilepton emission rate from the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor, at finite temperature and vorticity. Our results show that vorticity induces characteristic modifications in the light dilepton channel, namely $e^-e^+$ production, where the emission spectrum exhibits a suppression at low transverse mass together with a mild shift of the production threshold. This behavior originates from the role of vorticity as an effective spin-dependent chemical potential that alters the available phase-space distribution for the emission process. In contrast, the $\mu^-\mu^+$ channel is essentially insensitive to the rotational background, thus remaining dominated by its intrinsic mass threshold. The resulting channel dependence highlights a potential phenomenological handle for disentangling rotational effects in heavy-ion collisions: while light dilepton spectra encode the imprints of vorticity in the infrared sector, the muon channel provides a comparatively robust baseline.</description>

      <title>The Great Impersonation: $\mathcal{W}$-Solitons as Prototypical Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a new class of static, smooth geometries in five-dimensional supergravity, dubbed $\mathcal{W}$-solitons. They carry the same mass and charges as four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-like black holes but replace the horizon with a Kaluza-Klein bubble supported by electromagnetic flux. These solutions provide analytically tractable prototypes of black hole microstates in supergravity, including a new, astrophysically relevant neutral configuration involving a massless axion field. Focusing on photon scattering and scalar perturbations, we compute their key observables. We find that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons feature a single photon sphere, qualitatively similar to that of the black hole but with quantitative differences. They have only short-lived quasinormal modes (QNMs), as black holes, while long-lived echo modes seen in other ultracompact horizonless objects are absent. As a result, the ringdown closely resembles that of a black hole while still showing sizable deviations. The latter are at the ${\mathcal{O}}(10\%)$ level, compatible with the recent measurement of GW250114 and potentially falsifiable in the near future. Finally, we show that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons are stable under scalar perturbations. Our results underscore the qualitative similarities between $\mathcal{W}$-solitons and black holes, reinforcing their relevance as smooth black hole microstate prototypes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the economical 331 model, based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, with three $SU(3)$ triplets with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting scalar potential is commonly used in phenomenology. We systematically determine all the potential minima and obtain the conditions under which the electroweak vacuum is global with the help of orbit space methods. For the case the electroweak vacuum is not global, we calculate bounds on the scalar couplings from metastability. We find a parametrisation of the potential couplings in terms of physical quantities and use it to show the available parameter space.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Computational Determination of the Weak Mixing Angle in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The weak mixing angle $s_W$ is a fundamental constant in the Standard Model (SM) and measured at the $Z$ boson mass to be $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z) = 0.23129 \pm 0.00004$ in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ renormalization scheme, where $m_Z=91.2\ \text{GeV}$. On the other hand, non-stabilizerness - the magic - characterizes the computational advantage of a quantum system over classical computers. We consider the production of magic from stabilizer initial states, which carry zero magic, in the 2-to-2 scattering of charged leptons in the SM at the tree level, which is mediated by the photon and the $Z$ boson. Using the second order stabilizer R\'enyi entropy, and averaging over all 60 initial stabilizer states and the scattering angle, we compute and minimize the magic production as a function of $s^2_W$ in the M\o ller scattering $e^-e^-\to e^-e^-$, which is free of kinematic thresholds. At the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=m_Z$, there is a unique minimum in magic production at $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W(m_Z)=0.2317$, which agrees with the measured $\widehat{s}^2_W(m_Z)$ at the sub-percent level. At higher energies, the magic-minimizing $\mathbf{s}^{2}_W$ continues to agree with the empirical value at the percent level or better, up to 10 TeV. The finding suggests the electroweak sector of the SM tends to generate minimal quantum resources from the computational viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Kruskal Universe: a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole in unitary unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the physical properties of an analytical, nonsingular quantum-corrected black hole solution recently derived in a minisuperspace model for unimodular gravity under the assumption of unitarity in unimodular time. We show that the metric corrections compared to the classical Schwarzschild solutions only depend on a single new parameter, corresponding to a minimal radius where a black hole-white hole transition occurs. While these corrections substantially alter the structure of the spacetime near this minimal radius, they fall off rapidly towards infinity, and we show in various examples how physical properties of the exterior spacetime are very close to those of the Schwarzschild solution. We derive the maximal analytic extension of the initial solution, which corresponds to an infinite sequence of Kruskal spacetimes connected via black-to-white hole transitions, and compare with some other proposals for non-singular black hole metrics. The metric violates the achronal averaged null energy condition, which indicates that we are capturing physics beyond the semiclassical approximation. Finally, we include some thoughts on how to go beyond the simple eternal black hole-white hole model presented here.</description>

      <title>Exploring Black Hole Environments</title>

Abstract: The past decade has transformed our ability to observe the Universe. Via gravitational waves, merging black holes and neutron stars can now be directly detected, offering unprecedented opportunities to test General Relativity and explore astrophysics in a new way. Driven by this breakthrough, the next generation of detectors is being developed to observe a wider range of sources with greater precision, ushering in a new era in gravitational-wave astronomy: leveraging black holes as probes of new physics.
  This thesis investigates how astrophysical environments, such as plasma, dark-matter structures, and clouds of ultralight bosons, affect black holes and their gravitational-wave signatures. After a short overview of gravitational-wave astrophysics, I study three classes of scenarios. (i) Isolated black holes: I examine boson clouds around black holes, their electromagnetic couplings and the role of surrounding plasma. (ii) Ringdown: I show that plasma can strongly modify the ringdown of charged black holes, whereas realistic dark-matter halos produce no detectable deviations even for next-generation detectors. (iii) Inspiral: for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with boson clouds, I find that orbital resonances typically destroy the cloud unless the orbit is nearly counter-rotating, yielding new and exciting observational signatures. Entering the relativistic regime, I develop a self-consistent perturbative framework to model generic environments in extreme-mass-ratio binaries and apply it to the boson-cloud case. Finally, I construct a model for binaries repeatedly crossing active galactic-nucleus disks and track their long-term orbital evolution. The results of this thesis show how black hole environments shape gravitational-wave signals and open avenues for testing new physics with future observatories such as LISA or the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Localized five-dimensional rotating brane-world black hole Analytically Connected to an to an AdS$_5$ boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a method to describe the geometry of an analytic, exponentially localized $5D$ rotating braneworld black hole, using the $5D$ Janis Newman algorithm in Hopf coordinates. The induced metric on the brane matches the standard $4D$ Kerr spacetime. Two curvature singularities arise: one confined to the $3$-brane at $z = r = 0$, and another that, on the brane, reproduces the Kerr singularity at $r = 0$, $\bar{\theta} = \pi/2$. The inner and event horizons, together with the stationary limit hypersurfaces, extend into the extra dimension in a pancake-like shape. We describe their behavior in the bulk.
  The energy momentum tensor represents a source transitioning from an anisotropic, non diagonal structure to a vacuum with negative cosmological constant. Thus, the localized black hole connects to an AdS$_5$ boundary. The geometry is supported by a non-diagonal anisotropic fluid in the bulk, requiring no matter on the brane. To evaluate the energy conditions, we use a one form from the dual basis that yields a diagonal energy momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Semianalytic calculation of the gravitational wave spectrum induced by curvature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is secondarily and inevitably induced by the primordial curvature perturbations beyond the first order of the cosmological perturbation theory. We analytically calculate the integration kernel of the power spectrum of the induced GWs, which is the universal part independent of the spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations, in the radiation-dominated era and in the matter-dominated era. We derive fully analytic expressions of the GW spectrum when possible. As a minor update, we study the case of the top-hat function as the spectrum of the curvature perturbations. We also discuss generalization in the presence of multiple cosmological eras with different equations of state.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Perturbation in New General Relativity: Propagating mode from the violation of local Lorentz invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the propagating modes of New General Relativity (NGR) in second-order linear perturbations in the Lagrangian density (first-order in field equations). The Dirac-Bergmann analysis has revealed a violation of local Lorentz invariance in NGR. We review the recent status of NGR, considering the results of its Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We then reconsider the vierbein perturbation framework and identify the origin of each perturbation field in the vierbein field components. This identification is mandatory for adequately fixing gauges while guaranteeing consistency with the invariance guaranteed by the Dirac-Bergmann analysis. We find that the spatially flat gauge is adequate for analyzing a theory with the violation of local Lorentz invariance. Based on the established vierbein perturbative framework, introducing a real scalar field as a test matter, we perform a second-order perturbative analysis of NGR with respect to tensor, scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector and pseudo-vector modes. We reveal the possible propagating modes of each type of NGR. In particular, we find that Type 3 has stable five propagating modes, \textit{i.e.}, tensor, scalar, and vector modes, compared to five non-linear degrees of freedom, which results in its Dirac-Bergmann analysis; Type 3 is preferable for the application to cosmology. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to previous related work and conclude this study.</description>

      <title>On Massive Neutrinos and Coherence in Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the central tenet of the current standard theory of neutrino oscillations, namely the assumption that neutrinos are emitted and detected as flavour neutrino states, which are coherent superpositions of massive neutrino states of different masses. We prove that all the quantum mechanical and quantum field theoretical arguments, including the invocation of the uncertainty principle and the wave packet description of massive neutrinos, entail the production of neutrinos as statistical ensembles of massive neutrino states. As the states in a statistical ensemble do not interfere, neutrino oscillations cannot be explained by the superposition of massive states. We point out that neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be consistently formulated in theories which include, among other assumptions, the premise that the asymptotic states are massless flavour neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Magnetization by Rotation: Spin and Chiral Condensates in the NJL Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The role of spin degrees of freedom in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has attracted significant interest in recent years. Spin hydrodynamics extends conventional hydrodynamics by incorporating spin via the spin tensor. In the mean-field limit of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model under rigid rotation, spin degrees of freedom manifest naturally as axial-vector, or spin, condensate. We investigate the interplay between chiral and spin condensates in this framework. While rotation typically suppresses the formation of a chiral condensate, the presence of a spin condensate may counteract this effect, enhancing the chiral condensate. Moreover, it can alter the nature of the chiral transition from second to first order.</description>

      <title>Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradients act as invisible engines of transport, converting microscopic imbalances into macroscopic flows, and thus providing deep insights into the dynamics of physical systems. Thermal gradients do not merely drive the flow of heat, but they also set the microscopic constituents of the system into motion. In such scenarios, the constituents of the system not only transport energy but also diffuse collectively under the influence of these gradients. For the very first time, we present a first-principles investigation of the Soret and Dufour effects in hot and dense quantum chromodynamics (QCD) matter. We use the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation under the relaxation time approximation. By incorporating chemical potential and temperature gradients into the kinetic theory framework, we derive explicit expressions for the Dufour coefficient, which quantifies the heat flow due to concentration gradients, and the Soret coefficient, which describes the particle diffusion induced by thermal gradients. These coupled-transport phenomena are traditionally studied in multi-component classical systems at low energy scales. In this study, we follow quasiparticle models for the deconfined phase and the hadron resonance gas model for the confined hadronic phase in the context of heavy-ion collisions. This study provides novel insights into the thermo-diffusion and diffusion-thermo phenomena and opens avenues for incorporating such effects in hydrodynamic modeling and transport simulations of QCD matter.</description>

Abstract: We interpret the ranks of the rational homotopy groups of a K3 surface as dimensions of representations for the largest sporadic simple Mathieu group. We then construct a vertex algebra equipped with an action by the largest Mathieu group, and use it to associate Jacobi forms to this interpretation, in a compatible way. Our results suggest a topological role for the sporadic simple Mathieu groups in the theory of K3 surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct four-dimensional gravity theories that resolve the Schwarzschild singularity and enable dynamical studies of nonsingular gravitational collapse. The construction employs a class of nonpolynomial curvature invariants that produce actions with (i) second-order equations of motion in spherical symmetry and (ii) a Birkhoff theorem, ensuring uniqueness of the spherically symmetric solution. Upon spherical reduction to two dimensions, these theories map to a particular subclass of Horndeski scalar-tensor models, which we use to explicitly verify the formation of regular black holes as the byproduct of the collapse of pressureless stars and thin-shells. We also show that linear perturbations on top of maximally symmetric backgrounds are governed by second-order equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the Gell-Mann--Nishijima formula for the assignment of electric charges to the components of an arbitrary-dimensional multiplet which transforms under general gauge symmetries, regardless of whether these multiplets couple to particles with known charge. The method is valid for local or global unitary symmetries and works for theories with or without spontaneous or explicit symmetry breaking. We extend the method for other conserved charges as flavors (horizontal symmetries) and color (QCD).</description>

      <title>A D-brane fantasy on noncommutative mirror symmetry, prelude: Noncommutative ringed spaces from local noncommutative crepant resolutions of a singular Calabi-Yau space, dynamical D-branes thereupon, and questions beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the world-sheet of a fundamental string, the world-volume of stacked D-branes carries an Azumaya noncommutative structure ([L-Y1: Sec.\ 2] (D(1))), allowing it to directly serve as a probe into noncommutative target-spaces. This feature leads to a D-brane fantasy: {\it Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry between noncommutative Calabi-Yau spaces may be realized as different realizations of a supersymmetric D-brane world-volume quantum field theory exactly like the string world-sheet aspect for Mirror Symmetry between (commutative) Calabi-Yau manifolds}. Driven by this fantasy, in the current notes a class of noncommutative ringed spaces shadowing over a $C^\infty$-manifold with corners are constructed from gluing local noncommutative crepant resolutions of Gorenstein isolated singularities. Dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative target-spaces are realized as maps/morphisms from an Azumaya manifold with a fundamental module with a connection $\nabla$ thereto. The notion of $\nabla$-adjusted kinetic energy for such a map is given via the basic noncommutative differential calculus developed earlier in [L-Y4] (D(11.1)). This provides an action functional for dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative spaces in parallel to the Polyakov action functional for fundamental bosonic strings on a commutative target-space. This sets up a basic stage to begin with for the realization of the D-brane fantasy on Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry. Questions beyond are sampled along the discussion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Conifold Gap Conjecture asserts that the polar part of the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau threefold near its conifold locus has a universal expression described by the logarithm of the Barnes $G$-function. In this paper, I prove the Conifold Gap Conjecture for the local projective plane. The proof relates the higher genus conifold Gromov-Witten generating series of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ to the thermodynamics of a certain statistical mechanical ensemble of repulsive particles on the positive half-line. As a corollary, this establishes the all-genus mirror principle for local $\mathbb{P}^2$ through the direct integration of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.08512v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of matching the strong coupling expansion of the $\frac{1}{2}$ BPS circular Wilson loops in ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and ABJM gauge theories with their string theory duals in ${\rm AdS}_5 \times S^5$ and ${\rm AdS}_4 \times CP^3$, at the first subleading (one-loop) order of the expansion around the minimal surface. We observe that, including the overall factor $1/g_{\rm s}$ of the inverse string coupling constant, as appropriate for the open string partition function with disk topology, and a universal prefactor proportional to the square root of the string tension $T$, both the SYM and ABJM results precisely match the string theory prediction. We provide an explanation of the origin of the $\sqrt T$ prefactor based on special features of the combination of one-loop determinants appearing in the string partition function. The latter also implies a natural generalization $Z_\chi \sim (\sqrt T/g_{\rm s})^\chi$ to higher genus contributions with the Euler number $\chi$, which is consistent with the structure of the $1/N$ corrections found on the gauge theory side.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of Nambu-Goto cosmic string loops coupled to a massive Kalb-Ramond field. This coupling provides a framework for describing the interaction between the cosmic string and the gauge field. Within this setup, we compute the energy flux associated with the radiation of massive Kalb-Ramond modes from oscillating string loops. For loops featuring kinks, we find that the decay time scales with the square of the loop length. In contrast, loops with cusps exhibit a decay time proportional to 3/2 times the loop length. The results are in good agreement with field-theoretic simulations of Nambu-Goto-like loops in the Abelian-Higgs model, supporting the validity of the calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reinterpret the Nieh-Yan (NY) anomaly using holography, finding that the U(1) axial symmetry remains unbroken and the axial current coupling to an external gauge field is conserved. Instead, the anomaly arises from a breakdown of Hodge duality relations between fermion bilinears due to symmetry constraints on one-form currents. We show that the axial response associated with the NY term is distinct from the chiral vortical effect and exhibits a characteristic $T^2$ dependence. Torsion-induced axial transport decouples spin and axial charge dynamics, thereby clarifying the physical significance of the NY anomaly and motivating further field-theoretic and holographic studies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we have studied the effects of noncommutative geometry on the properties of p-wave holographic superconductors with massive vector condensates in the probe limit. We have applied the St\"{u}rm-Liouville eigenvalue approach to analyse the model. In this model, we have calculated the critical temperature and the value of the condensation operator for two different values of $m^2$. We have also shown how the influence of noncommutative geometry modifies these quantities. Finally, by applying a linearised gauge field perturbation along the boundary direction, we calculated the holographic superconductor's AC conductivity using a self-consistent approach and then carried out a more rigorous analysis. The noncommutative effects are also found to be present in the result of AC conductivity. We have also found that just like the commutative case, here the DC conductivity diverges due to the presence of a first order pole in the frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Generating Jackiw-Teitelboim Euclidean gravity from static three-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons electromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider pure three-dimensional Maxwell-Chern-Simons electrodynamics in the static limit. We show that this theory can be mapped onto a two-dimensional gravitational model in the first-order formalism of Riemannian manifolds with Euclidean signature, coupled to a real scalar field naturally interpreted as a dilaton. In this framework, the Newtonian and cosmological constants in two dimensions are fully determined by the electric charge. The solution to this gravitational model is found to be trivial: a constant dilaton field on a flat manifold. However, we introduce two distinct shifts of the spin-connection that transform the model into Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Specifically, we identify two additional solutions: a hyperbolic manifold with also a constant dilaton configuration; and a spherical manifold where, again, the dilaton assumes a constant, nonzero field configuration. In both non-flat cases, by employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in the specific cases of compact manifolds, we establish that the manifold's radius is fixed by the cosmological constant (and, therefore, by the electric charge).</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Warped Solutions from Type IIB Orientifold Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of supersymmetric solutions in Type IIB supergravity of the form ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm WS}^3\times T^4$, where ${\rm WAdS}_3$ and ${\rm WS^3}$ denote a warped anti-de Sitter spacetime and a warped 3-sphere, respectively, while $T^4$ denotes an internal 4-torus. These backgrounds are constructed by uplifting corresponding solutions in the $D=6$, $\mathcal{N}=(1,1)$ ungauged supergravity resulting from the compactification of Type IIB supergravity on a $T^4/\mathbb{Z}_2$-orientifold. More specifically, the supersymmetric solutions are ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm WS}^3\times T^4$ with lightlike warped AdS$_3$ and ${\rm WAdS}_3\times {\rm S}^3\times T^4$ in which the warping of AdS$_3$ is generic. Moreover, we also construct solutions in the form of a warped product $\mathrm{LM}^3_{\zeta,\omega}\times_{{\rm w}} \mathrm{S}^3\times T^4$ of a 2-parameter deformation $\mathrm{LM}^3_{\zeta,\omega}$ of ${\rm AdS}_3$ and a three-sphere. We discuss the relation of these backgrounds to known solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the no-boundary proposal for closed universes with an observer. We argue that the observer's no-boundary state is the identity operator on the physical Hilbert space, i.e., the maximum entropy state and show this explicitly in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Geometrically, the no-boundary state is a bra-ket wormhole. Expectation values in the no-boundary state provide a trace for the observer's algebra, which allows one to define von Neumann entropy for observers in different universes as the relative entropy with respect to the no-boundary state. This result is consistent with all previously discussed cases of traces for invariantly defined regions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features in scattering mediated by heavy particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by an intermediate heavy particle exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics with multiple charges and holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the connection between thermodynamic and dynamical instabilities in relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple flavours of conserved U(1) charges. In theories with positive hydrodynamic entropy production, where the underlying perfect fluid has a positive speed of sound squared and satisfies the null energy condition, we show that hydrodynamic instabilities can arise only through negative diffusion coefficients associated with the U(1) charges. The onset of such instabilities is governed by the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic Hessian matrix, while the flavour-space polarisations of the unstable diffusion modes are determined by the corresponding eigenvectors. We illustrate this connection using strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory at finite densities of the three U(1) R-charges. In the dual holographic description, the five-dimensional STU black brane exhibits unstable quasinormal modes precisely at the onset of thermodynamic instability. We derive analytic expressions for the R-charge diffusion coefficients in several representative cases, including the configuration with three equal chemical potentials.</description>

      <title>Exploring Pintopia: Reflection Branes, Bordisms, and U-Dualities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The U-dualities of maximally supersymmetric non-chiral supergravity (SUGRA) theories lead to strong constraints on the non-perturbative structure of quantum gravity. In this paper we determine Spin- and Pin-lifts of these dualities, which extend this action to fermionic degrees of freedom. Among other things, this allows us to access non-supersymmetric sectors of these low energy effective field theories in which bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are treated differently. We use this refinement of the duality groups, in tandem with the Swampland Cobordism Conjecture, to predict new codimension-two branes. These are a natural generalization of the recently discovered R7-branes of type II string theories. The first bordism groups for Spin-twisted duality bundles follow directly from the Abelianization of the duality groups. Viewing the SUGRA theory as the low energy limit of a toroidal compactification of M-theory, winding around these codimension-two defects enacts a reflection around one of the torus directions, which in the effective field theory appears as a charge conjugation symmetry. We establish some basic properties of such branes, including determining BPS objects which can end on it, as well as braiding rules and bound states realized by multiple reflection branes.</description>

      <title>Page curves and island's delays in asymptotically flat 2d spacetimes with injections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore spacetimes with multiple energy injections in asymptotically flat two-dimensional black hole and analyze the entanglement entropy in such spacetimes. This work is an extension of the setup of the single-injection case, by F. F. Gautason, L. Schneiderbauer, W. Sybesma and L. Thorlacius, to include the multiple energy injections. We derive the solution of the model, by J. G. Russo, L. Susskind and L. Thorlacius, for a general number $n$ of the total injections, and discuss the entropy only for the case $n=2$. The essential point of this work is in the delay of the island. This delay makes the intermediate state necessary, where the island's endpoint lies between the 1st and the 2nd injections while the observer is located after the 2nd injection. The intermediate state makes the entanglement entropy evolve continuously across the 2nd injection time.</description>

      <title>Simple harmonic oscillators from non-semisimple walled Brauer algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Walled Brauer algebras $B_N ( m , n ) $ illuminate the combinatorics of mixed tensor representations of $U(N)$, with $m$ copies of the fundamental and $n$ copies of the anti-fundamental representation. They lie at the intersection of research in representation theory, AdS/CFT and quantum information theory. They have been used to study of correlators in multi-matrix models motivated by brane-anti-brane physics in AdS/CFT. They have been applied in computing and optimising fidelities of port-based quantum teleportation. There is a large $N$ regime, specifically $ N \ge (m+n)$ where the algebras are semi-simple and their representation theory more tractable. There are known combinatorial formulae for dimensions of irreducible representations and associated reduction multiplicities. The large $N$ regime has a stability property whereby these formulae are independent of $N$. In this paper we initiate a systematic study of the combinatorics in the non-semisimple regime of $ N = m +n - l $, with positive $l$. We introduce restricted Bratteli diagrams (RBD) which are useful as an instrument to process known data from the large $N$ regime to calculate representation theory data in the non-semisimple regime. We identify within the non-semisimple regime, a region of $(m,n)$-stability, where $ \min ( m, n ) \ge ( 2l -3) $ and the RBD take a stable form depending on $l$ only and not the choice of $ m,n$ within the region. In this regime, several aspects of the combinatorics of the RBD are controlled by a universal partition function for an infinite tower of simple harmonic oscillators closely related, but not identical, to the partition function of 2D non-chiral free scalar field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The matrix models are non-perturbative formulations of string theory, from which many believe that spacetime arises. The matrix fluctuations around the spacetime thus created should represent both matter and gravitational fields. In this paper, we discuss how the gravitational field emerges from the IIB matrix model. In particular, we consider how diffeomorphism invariance arises and how unitarity is guaranteed in this theory. Specifically, we consider matrices as bilocal fields and discuss how the Lorentz-invariant vacuum and low-energy excitations around it can be expressed. We then discuss how the conditions for the theory to be unitary can be written in terms of bilocal fields. We argue that in the low-energy limit, the bilocal fields are reduced to local fields consisting of a finite number of massless fields and an infinite number of massive fields, satisfying unitarity.</description>

Abstract: We construct an exact solution in four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory, describing multi-centered rotating black holes carrying both electric and magnetic charges, obtained via dimensional reduction from five-dimensional Einstein gravity. This generalizes the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution to the rotating case, and extends the recent multi-centered rotating black hole solutions of Teo and Wan to configurations with unequal electric and magnetic charges. The resulting spacetimes are free of curvature singularities, conical defects, Dirac-Misner strings, and closed timelike curves, both on and outside the horizons, provided that the black holes have either aligned or anti-aligned spin orientations.</description>

Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $4d$ $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) half Seiberg--Witten spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in at least two different ways, Hurwitz numbers, quantum curves, and (almost complete) description of the correlators as analytic functions of $\hslash$ (instead of formal series). The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Do{\l}{\k{e}}ga--Osuga.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of stochastic quantization. The difference between stochastic quantization and the present approach is that the former is well defined only for Euclidean field theories, while the latter allows to sample the causal structure of space-time. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a 1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda\ll1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this microcanonical ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a canonical-like one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi]\propto\exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the ground states of a chiral magnet with a square anisotropy and show that it supports domain wall networks as stable ground states. A domain wall junction in the domain wall network turns out to be a skyrmion with half topological charge and, therefore, the found domain wall network has a second topological nature, a skyrmion crystal. More specifically, we present a ground-state phase diagram of the chiral magnet with varying anisotropy parameters consisting of skyrmion lattices, chiral soliton lattices, and ferromagnetic states. In the presence of the square anisotropy, the skyrmion crystal forms a domain wall network. The size of domains in the domain wall network is shown to be tunable by an external magnetic field, offering a way to realize experimentally detectable domain wall networks.</description>

Abstract: Reference frames are crucial for describing local observers in general relativity. In quantum gravity, different proposals exist for how to treat reference frames. There are models with either classical or quantum reference frames. Recently, different choices appeared for investigating these possibilities at the level of the classical and quantum algebra of observables. One choice is based on the covariant phase space approach, using gravitational edge modes. In the canonical approach, there is another choice, relational clocks, built from matter or geometry itself. In this work, we extend existing results and show how to relate edge modes and geometrical clocks in linearized gravity. We proceed in three steps. First, we introduce an extension of the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) phase space to account for covariant gauge fixing conditions and the explicit time dependence they add to Hamilton's equations. Second, we show how these gauge fixing conditions recover a specific choice of geometrical clocks in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables. Third, we study the effect of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter on the generators of asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding charges. This parameter, which disappears from metric gravity, affects the generators for angle-dependent asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding super-translation charges, while it has no effect on the global charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study point impurities in non-relativistic quantum field theories, with a focus on scale-invariant fixed points. We establish the framework of conformal defects in Schr\"{o}dinger field theories and their correspondence to many-body states in a harmonic trap. We discuss a multi-critical quantization of the one-body wave function induced by an impurity, with examples of free and unitary Fermi gases. Our results can potentially be tested in experimental setups.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity 2: Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate degrees of freedom in New General Relativity. This theory is the three-parameter extension of Teleparallel Equivalent to GR and classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}], we investigated the degrees of freedom in NGR types that are of interest in describing gravity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. In this work, we focus on unveiling those numbers in all other types to complete the analysis of NGR. After providing the Hamiltonian formulation of NGR and considering in detail the regularity of NGR, we perform the analysis of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9. We reveal that the degrees of freedom of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 are five, zero (purely topological system in bulk spacetime), and three, respectively. Type 4 and Type 9 have second-class constraint densities only, whereas Type 7 has first-class constraint densities only. In every type, no bifurcation occurs. In particular, Type 4 and Type 7 are irregular and provide specific examples of handling irregular systems. Since no general method is known for treating an irregular system, this work contributes to furthering the understanding of irregular systems.</description>

      <title>The probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrino in Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04320v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the probability for chiral oscillation of Majorana neutrinos based on quantum field theory. Since the Hamiltonian under the Majorana mass term does not conserve lepton number, the eigenstates of lepton number change continuously over time. Therefore, the transition amplitude is described by the inner product of the eigenstates of lepton number at the time of the neutrino production and the detection. With the Bogoliubov transformation, we successfully relates the lepton number eigenstates at different times. This method enables us to understand the time variation of lepton number induced by chiral oscillations in terms of transition probabilities. We also present the physical picture that emerges through the Bogoliubov transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An isolated supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) produces an identical cross-correlation pattern of pulsar timings as an isotropic stochastic background gravitational waves (GWs) generated possibly by inflation. Can there remain the identical cross-correlation pattern in the presence of a secondary SMBHB? To address this issue, the present paper focuses on GWs with similar amplitudes but slightly different frequencies $f_1$ and $f_2$ coming from two different directions. Beats between the two GWs can modify angular correlation patterns. The beat-induced correlation patterns are not stationary but modulated with a beat frequency $f_{beat} \equiv |f_1 - f_2|$. We obtain an analytic solution that allows us to infer $f_{beat}$ from the modulated angular correlations.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge sum rules for quark fragmentation functions are studied. The simultaneous implementation of the conservation of electric and baryon charges, strangeness and isospin symmetry is achieved when the fragmentation to both mesons and baryons is considered. The results are compatible to Gell-Mann--Nishijima formulas and may be the new manifestation of superconformal symmetry between mesons and baryons. The numerical estimates are performed and compared with phenomenological models. The recently suggested violations of sum rules due to Wilson lines contributions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Fractionalized fermionic multicriticality in anisotropic Kitaev spin-orbital liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the low-temperature phase diagram of quantum Kitaev-Heisenberg spin-orbital models with XXZ anisotropy on the honeycomb lattice. Within a parton mean-field theory, we identify three different quantum phases, distinguished by their symmetries. Besides a disordered spin-orbital liquid with unbroken U(1) x Z2 spin rotational symmetry, there are two orbital liquid phases characterized by spin long-range order. In these phases, the spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken down to residual U(1) and Z2 symmetries, respectively. The symmetric spin-orbital liquid features three flavors of linearly dispersing gapless Majorana fermions. In the symmetry-broken phases, one of the three Majorana excitations remains gapless, while the other two acquire a band gap. The transitions from the symmetric to the symmetry-broken phases are continuous and fall into the fractionalized Gross-Neveu-Z2* and Gross-Neveu-SO(2)* universality classes, respectively. The transition between the ordered phases is discontinuous. Using a renormalization group analysis based on the epsilon expansion, we demonstrate that the triple point in the phase diagram features fractionalized fermionic multicriticality with emergent SO(3) symmetry.</description>

Abstract: The generation of large curvature perturbations associated with the production of primordial black holes is studied in the context of a Higgs inflaton. To enable this amplification, we consider an inflationary model in which the tree-level action for gravity and the Standard Model Higgs is modified by quantum corrections, described by a series of higher-dimension operators. Finally within a minimal EFT framework, we present two viable models in which the spectrum of curvature perturbations generated by the Higgs field is consistent with CMB observations and can lead to the formation of primordial black holes in the asteroid mass range, potentially accounting for the entirety of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous CP violation during the electroweak phase transition can induce a twisting of the magnetic field configuration of Standard Model dumbbells, resulting in sizable intergalactic magnetic fields and a small baryon asymmetry, in agreement with observations. We demonstrate this by coupling the electroweak gauge group of the Standard Model to an axion-like particle with a non-vanishing velocity. Studying the resulting monopole, string and dumbbell configurations, we conclude that the helicity fraction of the magnetic fields generated at the electroweak phase transition is roughly given by the dimensionless axion velocity.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole scalarization with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant can evade no-hair theorems and allow for non-trivial scalar profiles around black holes. This coupling is characterized by a length scale $\lambda$, which, in an effective field theory perspective, sets the threshold below which deviations from General Relativity become significant. LIGO/VIRGO constraints indicate $\lambda$ is small, implying supermassive black holes should not scalarize. However, recent work suggests that scalarization can occur within a narrow window of masses, allowing supermassive black holes to scalarize, while leaving LIGO/VIRGO sources unaffected. We explore the impact of this scenario on the stochastic gravitational wave background recently observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We find that scalarization can alter the characteristic strain produced by circularly inspiralling SMBH binaries and that current data shows a marginal preference for a non-zero $\lambda$. However, similar signatures could arise from astrophysical effects such as orbital eccentricity or environmental interactions, emphasizing the need for improved modeling and longer observations to discriminate among the different scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, quantum theory of a real massive scalar field in the background of a traversable wormhole is examined. The wormhole is supposed to connect two different universes; as a particular example the simplest Ellis wormhole is considered. It is shown that the resulting theory possesses a doubling of quantum states parametrized by the same value of asymptotic momentum; two different sets of such degenerate states are localized in different universes. This is a consequence of the topological structure of the wormhole spacetime, which is the same as the topological structure of the Schwarzschild spacetime providing a similar degeneracy of quantum states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exotic dark matter (EDM) refers to a dark matter species whose equation of state deviates from zero at late times. This behavior enables it to model a variety of non-standard late-time cosmologies, offering alternatives to various dark energy (DE) models, especially when the DE sector violates the null energy condition. In this work, by fitting to CMB, BAO, and Supernovae (SNe) data and comparing models in a Bayesian approach, we show that simple models of exotic dark matter are statistically comparable to the $w_0w_a$CDM DE model in explaining the recent anomaly in the late-time cosmological evolution suggested by DESI and supernova observations, although in both classes of models the evidence against the $\Lambda$CDM model only appears when the DES-Y5 or Union3 SNe dataset is included. The value of $H_0$ remains similar to that in the DE model, except in the no-SNe case, where the DE model predicts lower values than $\Lambda$CDM, thereby worsening the Hubble tension, whereas the EDM models yield values closer to that of $\Lambda$CDM, albeit with larger uncertainty. In addition, the EDM models predict a drastically different energy budget for the present-day universe compared to the standard model, and provide an explanation for a coincidence problem in the DE-model explanation of the DESI anomaly.</description>

      <title>Lattice results for the equation of state in dense QCD-like theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review recent progress in Monte Carlo simulations of dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), focusing on the phase diagram, the equation of state, and the sound velocity in the low-temperature regime. In three-color QCD at finite density, especially at low temperatures, the notorious sign problem makes lattice Monte Carlo simulations intractable. In contrast, QC$_2$D is free from this issue due to the pseudoreality of the quark representation. Recent independent lattice studies have revealed unexpected phenomena through first-principles calculations of the phase structure and thermodynamics. A particularly notable finding is that the sound velocity exceeds the so-called conformal (holography) bound, \( c_s^2/c^2 \le 1/3 \), which had not been observed in QCD-like theories at finite temperature. In this review, we focus primarily on results from a series of works by our group~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2020emi,Iida:2022hyy, Ishiguro:2021yxr, Iida:2024irv}, along with related studies in dense QC$_2$D and three-color QCD with isospin chemical potential. We discuss the possibility and physical implications of conformal bound violation even for three-color dense QCD, together with insights from effective model analyses and recent observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Black Hole in the accelerating Universe approaching the future singularity -- Possible origin of (super-)massive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and investigate the dynamical black hole spacetime embedded in the expanding universe filled with cosmic fluid, such as dark energy. When the equation of state (EoS) parameter of the fluid is a constant, we find exact solutions of the Einstein equation where the Schwarzschild black hole is embedded in the expanding universe. This solution differs from the well-known McVittie metric, where the EoS parameter is not a constant but rather depends on the radial coordinate. It is shown that a dynamical black hole grows with the expansion of the universe. If primordial black holes are created before or during inflation, above dynamical black holes might be the origin of the supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies, massive black holes suggested by the GW231123 event, and also the dark matter. The case where the cosmic fluid EoS is more general is also considered so that the universe enters the epoch of finite-time future singularity. Thermodynamics and the behaviour of black holes around different future singularities are carefully investigated. It is then demonstrated that the black hole horizon enhances the tidal force, but near the horizon, the tidal force works to press the extended object, which is in contrast with a massive body near to future singularity.
  We also propose a new type of future singularity where the singularity inside the black hole is a sphere with a finite radius. When the radius of the spherical singularity becomes larger than the radius of the black hole horizon, it becomes naked. The universe may end up with a cosmic doomsday when the radius of the singularity becomes infinite.</description>

      <title>Black holes in the external Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact and analytical solution, in four-dimensional general relativity coupled with Maxwell electromagnetism, is built by means of a Lie point symmetry of the Ernst equations, the Harrison transformation. The new spacetime describes a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded into a general external back-reacting electromagnetic field, which is the superposition of the Levi-Civita-Bertotti-Robinson and the Bonnor-Melvin ones. Conserved charges and the first law of thermodynamics are analysed. Swirling generalisations are also considered. Limits to the known metrics such as Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson, Schwarzschild-Bonnor-Melvin and Bertotti-Robinson-Bonnor-Melvin are discussed.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ precursors of the free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathrm{U}(N)$ invariant polynomials on the space of $N\times N$ matrices first introduced by Capitaine and Casalis, that are precursors of free cumulants in various respects. First, they are polynomials of deterministic matrices, that are not yet evaluated over some probability law, contrary to what is usually meant by cumulants. Secondly, they converge towards the algebraic expression of free cumulants in terms of moments as $N\to \infty$, with $1/N^2$ corrections expressed in terms of monotone Hurwitz numbers. Their most crucial property is their additivity with respect to averaging over sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, providing a finite $N$ version of the well-known additivity of free cumulants in free probability. Finally, they extend several properties of free cumulants at finite $N$, including a Wick rule for their average over a Gaussian weight and their appearance in various matrix integrals. Building on the additivity property of these precursors, we also define and compute a coproduct describing the behaviour of general invariant polynomials with respect to the addition of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ conjugacy orbits, as well as their expectation values on sums of $\mathrm{U}(N)$-invariant random matrices. In our construction, a central role is played by the so-called HCIZ integral, both for the definition of the precursors and for the derivation of their properties.</description>
