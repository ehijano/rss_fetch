      <title>Cosmological dynamics of holographic dark energy with non-minimally coupled scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider FRW universe filled with matter, non-minimally coupling (NMC) scalar field under $V(\phi) = V_{0}\phi^{2}$ potential and holographic vacuum energy. Dark energy is contributed from both holographic vacuum energy and the NMC scalar field. NMC effective gravitational constant $G_\text{eff}(\phi)$, is naturally defined at the action level. Therefore, the gravitational constant in the holographic vacuum density is an effective one, i.e. $ \rho_{\Lambda} = {3c^{2}}/{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}L^{2}}\,. $ Apparent horizon is chosen as IR holographic cutoff scale as it is a trapped null surface. There are nine fixed points in this dynamical system with four independent dimensionless parameters. We consider flat case and find that viable cosmological evolution follows the sequence: an initial stiff-fluid-dominated phase, transitioning through a nearly dust-dominated era, and eventually reaching a stable dark energy-dominating state. Stability analysis requires that $\xi &lt;0$ and $0 &lt; c &lt; 1$ for the theory to be physically valid. Since zero NMC coupling, $\xi=0$, is not allowed in the autonomous system, the model can not completely recover canonical scalar field case. That is to say, as $\xi \rightarrow 0^-$ and $c \rightarrow 0^+$, the model can only approach the canonical scalar case but can not completely recover it. To approach dust or stiff fluid dominations, both magnitudes of the NMC coupling and the holographic parameter must be small. Numerical integration shows that for any allowed values of $\xi$ and $c$, $w_\text{eff}$ approaches $-1$ at late times. Increasing of $c$ does not change shape of the $w_{\rm eff}$, but larger $c$ increases $w_\text{eff}$. As $\xi$ becomes stronger, dust era gradually disappears. Good behaviors of the dynamics require $-1 \ll \xi &lt;0$ and $0 &lt; c \ll 1$.</description>

      <title>A simple ghost free and caustic free mimetic scalar field dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chamseddine and Mukhanov have promoted the concept of mimetic dark matter as alternative dark matter candidate coming from gravitation. Unfortunately although being very interesting, their proposition turned out to have weakness among which ghost and caustic instabilities. In this paper I propose among the simplest ghost free and caustic free scalar field dark matter extension of their model; a proposition capable of challenging $\Lambda$CDM model or even capable of doing better.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Behavior from Static Equation of State in Non-Minimally Coupled Gravity with Scalar Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the cosmological implications of a modified gravity theory characterized by the function \( f(R, \Sigma, T) \), where \( R \) is the Ricci scalar, \( \Sigma \) represents a geometric deformation term, and \( T \) denotes the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. The model is reconstructed under the framework of three fundamental energy conditions: Null Energy Condition (NEC), Dominant Energy Condition (DEC), and Strong Energy Condition (SEC). We derive the corresponding Hubble parameter \( H(z) \) for each case and constrain the free parameters \( H_0 \), \( \alpha \), and \( \beta \) using the latest Cosmic Chronometer (CC) and Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernova datasets. A thorough analysis of physical quantities such as pressure, energy density, and the equation of state parameter is carried out. Furthermore, diagnostic tools including the deceleration parameter \( q(z) \), statefinder parameters \( \{r, s\} \), and the $O_m(z)$ diagnostic are employed to assess the models viability. Our findings suggest that the model can consistently describe late-time cosmic acceleration and offers distinct behavior under different energy conditions, all while aligning with current observational data.</description>

      <title>Wigner's friend's black hole adventure: an argument for complementarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement problem. In black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with nonlocal extensions of Wigner's friend scenarios into a unified argument. We briefly discuss possible resolutions.</description>

      <title>Limiting Geometry and Spectral Instability in Schwarzschild--de Sitter Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the quasinormal mode problem in Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes providing a unified infrastructure tailored for studying limiting configurations. Geometrically, we employ the hyperboloidal framework to explicitly implement Geroch's rigorous limiting procedures for families of spacetimes. This enables a controlled transition between Schwarzschild, de Sitter, and Nariai geometries. Numerically, we introduce the analytical mesh refinement technique into quasinormal mode calculations, successfully recovering -- within the appropriate limiting scenarios -- both known families of quasinormal modes: complex light-ring modes and purely imaginary de Sitter modes. We interpret these results in terms of spectral instability, where the notions of stable and unstable modes depends on the specific spacetime limit under consideration. In the Schwarzschild limit, de Sitter modes appear as a destabilizing effect on the continuous branch cut at $\omega = 0$. Conversely, the branch cut can be understood as emerging from an infinite accumulation of discrete modes at $\omega = 0$ in the transitional regime. We propose a heuristic measure of QNM density to characterize this accumulation and highlight the need for a more rigorous study of potential branch cut instabilities--especially relevant in the context of late-time gravitational wave signals. The proposed infrastructure provides a general and extensible framework for investigations in more complex spacetimes, such as Reissner--Nordstr\"om--de Sitter or Kerr--Newman--de Sitter.</description>

      <title>The Creation of Particles in an Expanding Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document is the Ph.D. thesis of Leonard Parker, submitted to Harvard University in 1966. Over the decades, several generations of physicists have been introduced to the concept of particle creation by gravitational fields, a phenomenon that has become a cornerstone in exploring the interplay between gravitation and quantum theory. Yet, the foundational breakthrough that led to the prediction and understanding of this phenomenon remains unfamiliar to many. In the interest of historical accuracy and in recognition of a seminal contribution to physics, the thesis has been retyped and made it freely available as an open-access (arXiv) document. The reissued thesis is accompanied by a Foreword that places the work in its proper historical context.
  As the team responsible for this new edition, we (Antonio Ferreiro, Jos\'e Navarro-Salas, and Silvia Pla) hope that future generations will continue to draw inspiration from this pioneering text.</description>

      <title>On the Natural Equivalence Between Canonical and Hilbert Energy Momentum Tensors via Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the structure and properties of the canonical energy momentum tensor (EMT) across a range of field theories. We begin by developing a unified and systematic method that naturally yields the canonical EMT for gauge theory, without the need for artificial symmetrization or improvement terms. Our analysis highlights how Noether's theorem intrinsically emphasizes the 1-form nature of gauge potentials. We further extend to general relativity and demonstrate that the assumption of metric compatibility naturally implies a torsion free connection. Building upon variational symmetry principles, we establish the equivalence between the Einstein Hilbert EMT and the canonical EMT, thereby clarifying their respective roles in field dynamics and conservation laws. Lastly, we present an alternative derivation of the Einstein field equations via Noether's theorem.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation at infinity with negative cosmological constant and AdS$_4$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The covariant characterization of the existence of gravitational radiation traversing infinity $\mathscr{J}$ in the presence of a negative cosmological constant is presented. It is coherent and consistent with the previous characterizations put forward for the cases of non-negative cosmological constant, relying on the properties of the asymptotic super-Poynting vector; or in more transparent terms, based on the intrinsic properties of the flux of tidal energy at infinity. The proposed characterization is fully satisfactory, it can be covariantly typified in terms of boundary data at infinity, and it can also be categorized according to the geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. The cases with no incoming radiation entering from (or no outgoing radiation escaping at) $\mathscr{J}$ can similarly be determined in terms of the boundary data or geometric properties of the rescaled Weyl tensor. In particular, we identify the most general boundary conditions that, in an initial-boundary value problem, ensure absence of gravitational radiation traversing $\mathscr{J}$: linear dependency between the Cotton-York tensor and the holographic stress tensor at $\mathscr{J}$. We also present novel conditions ensuring the absence of just incoming (outgoing) radiation at $\mathscr{J}$. These are given in a covariant way and also in terms of standard rescaled Weyl tensor scalars.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Hubble Tension: Insights from Reversible and Irreversible Thermodynamic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of reversible and irreversible thermodynamic processes in a cosmological context, focusing on their impact on the early and late-time expansion history of the universe. In our framework, gravitationally induced adiabatic matter creation/annihilation are treated as irreversible processes, while energy exchange between the cosmic bulk and the horizon is modeled as reversible. We propose two thermodynamic interacting scenarios with matter creation/annihilation in which energy flows from matter and radiation components to an effective entropic dark energy sector. In both scenarios, effective entropic dark energy initially exhibits properties akin to those of radiation and matter prior to recombination. Subsequently, it transitions into a quintessence state, ultimately converging towards the cosmological constant in the current epoch. Our models predict Hubble constant values of $H_0 = 71.73 \pm 0.79 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $H_0 = 71.06 \pm 0.79 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, which exhibit agreement with the recent 2024 SH0ES measurement of $H_0 = 73.17 \pm 0.86 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at levels of $1.2\sigma$ and $1.8\sigma$. When compared to the 2022 SH0ES baseline measurement of $H_0 = 73.04 \pm 1.04 \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, both models demonstrate concordance at $1\sigma$ and $1.5\sigma$. These results demonstrate that such thermodynamically motivated interactions can address the Hubble tension within a minimal extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in theory of ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the properties of black holes using a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics called modified Maxwell (ModMax), in conjunction with nonlinear massive gravity known as dRGT-like massive gravity. We start by deriving the exact black hole solutions within the framework of ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity and analyze how the parameters of both ModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity influence the characteristics of these black holes. Additionally, we calculate the thermodynamic quantities for these black holes in the non-extended phase space and investigate how the parameters of ModMax and dRGT-like massive gravity affect these quantities. We confirm that these quantities satisfy the first law of thermodynamics. We also examine local stability by analyzing heat capacity and assess how ModMax and the massive parameters influence phase transitions and physical limitation points. Next, we expand our analysis to the extended phase space, demonstrating that these thermodynamic quantities satisfy both the first law of thermodynamics and the Smarr relation in this context. Finally, we examine the isoperimetric ratio of black holes in ModMax-dRGT-like massive gravity.</description>

      <title>Peaking into the abyss: Characterizing the merger of equatorial-eccentric-geodesic plunges in rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational waveforms generated by critical, equatorial plunging geodesics of the Kerr metric that start from an unstable-circular-orbit, which describe the test-mass limit of spin-aligned eccentric black-hole mergers. The waveforms are generated employing a time-domain Teukolsky code. We span different values of the Kerr spin $-0.99 \le a \le 0.99 $ and of the critical eccentricity $e_c$, for bound ($0 \le e_c&lt;1$) and unbound plunges ($e_c \ge 1$). We find that, contrary to expectations, the waveform modes $h_{\ell m}$ do not always manifest a peak for high eccentricities or spins. In case of the dominant $h_{22}$ mode, we determine the precise region of the parameter space in which its peak exists. In this region, we provide a characterization of the merger quantities of the $h_{22}$ mode and of the higher-order modes, providing the merger structure of the equatorial eccentric plunges of the Kerr spacetime in the test-mass limit.</description>

      <title>Constraint on Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity with Different Dark energy Parametrizations from DESI DR2 BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological viability of symmetric teleparallel gravity, specifically the $f(Q)$ gravity model with a power-law form $f(Q) = \alpha Q^n$, in combination with two widely used dark energy parameterizations: Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL) and Barboza Alcaniz (BA). Employing the most recent DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) dataset along with previous BAO measurements, we constrain the model parameters through a robust Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. We examine the background evolution via key cosmological indicators including the Hubble parameter $H(z)$, deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the effective equation of state $\omega_{\rm eff}(z)$, and the Om diagnostic. Our results indicate that the inclusion of DESI DR2 data significantly tightens constraints on the model parameters and supports a consistent transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion. The present-day values of $q(0)$ and $\omega_{\rm eff}(0)$ lie within the quintessence regime for all datasets. However, for lower redshift values the behaviour varies between phantom-like and quintessence-like phases. Statistical comparison via $\chi^2$, AIC, BIC, and $R^2$ further demonstrate that both CPL + $f(Q)$ and BA + $f(Q)$ provide better or competitive fits to data compared to $\Lambda$CDM, hence offering a compelling geometric alternative for explaining late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the conversion mechanism from scalar field to gravitational waves in magnetic background in $f(R)$ gravity minimal coupled to the Maxwell electrodynamics. Applying the conversion in early universe with primordial magnetic field and the neutron star with strong magnetosphere, the generated gravitational waves, converted from the scalar field, exhibit distinct power spectra which can be potentially probed by future experiments such as DECIGO, BBO, CE and ET.</description>

      <title>New Solutions for Topological Defects with Continuous Distributions:A Conformal Metric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new exact solutions for two-dimensional geometries generated by continuous distributions of topological defects within a conformal metric framework. By reformulating Einstein's equations in two dimensions as a Poisson equation for the conformal factor, we analyze how smooth defect densities -- such as Gaussian, exponential, and power-law profiles -- regularize curvature singularities and encode nontrivial topological information. Each distribution yields a well-defined geometry that interpolates between localized curvature near the defect core and asymptotic flatness. We compute the Ricci scalar and total curvature, confirming consistency with the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Our results provide a unified geometric description of regularized disclination-like defects and offer insights into analog gravity, crystalline materials, and two-dimensional systems with emergent curvature.</description>

      <title>Non-linear stability analysis of $\ell$-Proca stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector boson stars, also known as Proca stars, exhibit remarkable dynamical robustness, making them strong candidates for potential astrophysical exotic compact objects. In search of theoretically well-motivated Proca star models, we recently introduced the $\ell$-Proca star, a multi-field extension of the spherical Proca star, whose $(2\ell + 1)$ constitutive fields have the same time and radial dependence, and their angular structure is given by all the available spherical harmonics for a fixed angular momentum number $\ell$. In this work, we conduct a non-linear stability analysis of these stars by numerically solving the Einstein-(multi, complex) Proca system for the case of $\ell = 2$, which are formed by five constitutive independent, complex Proca fields with $m = 0, |1|$, and $|2|$. Our analysis is based on long-term, fully non-linear, 3-dimensional numerical-relativity simulations without imposing any symmetry. We find that ($\ell=2$)-Proca stars are unstable throughout their entire domain of existence. In particular, we highlight that less compact configurations dynamically lose their global spherical symmetry, developing a non-axisymmetric $\tilde{m}=4$ mode instability and a subsequent migration into a new kind of multi-field Proca star formed by fields with different angular momentum number, $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$, that we identify as unstable multi-$\ell$ Proca stars.</description>

      <title>Infrared foundations for quantum geometry II: Catalogue of all torsion-like theories including new ghost-tachyon-free cases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of consistent effective field theories in the infrared demands that models be defined by their underlying gauge symmetries, rather than by an arbitrary tuning of couplings or a cherry-picking of operators which may not be stable against radiative corrections. Adhering to this principle, we systematically derive all linear, parity-conserving models that propagate a pair-antisymmetric rank-three field on a Minkowski background. Such models are relevant not only to torsion, but to many areas in high-energy physics ranging from dual graviton formulations to string theory and higher-spin theories. Following this exhaustive classification, we extract several unitary models. In the context of torsion, the results are remarkable. None of the models we obtain propagate scalar or pseudoscalar torsion, in stark contrast to the literature focus. Instead, all models propagate one or more vector torsion modes.</description>

      <title>Untangling Selberg from the Wilson spool: 1-loop determinants and trace formulae in (A)dS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leading quantum effects in perturbative quantum gravity are captured by functional determinants of kinetic operators. We study such 1-loop determinants in three-dimensional Euclidean (anti-) de Sitter gravity evaluated using two seemingly disparate tools, the Selberg zeta function and the Wilson spool. For the Euclidean BTZ black hole, we demonstrate the Wilson spool for massive bosons of arbitrary spin directly equates to a representation-theoretic version of the Selberg zeta function. In the case of Euclidean de Sitter, we show a new trace formula associated with the Fredholm determinant for the scalar Laplacian on the three-sphere reproduces the Wilson spool. Generalizing the trace formula, we comment on how to extend this Wilson spool construction to lens space quotients and higher-dimensional spheres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Headrick, Sasieta and myself provides an extension of the HRT formula for asymptotically flat spacetimes. I use this formula to construct a holographic model of black hole evaporation in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes using Brill-Lindquist (BL) wormholes. The wormhole is interpreted via ER=EPR to represent the entanglement geometry between an evaporating black hole and baths into which the Hawking radiation is collected. Applying HRT, I compute the entanglement entropy by numerically computing the areas of the minimal surfaces, which is shown to obey the Page curve, consistent with information conservation. Numerical analysis is done for both three and four-boundary BL wormholes ($n=3,4$). Index-1 surfaces in the wormhole interior are interpreted as the candidate bulges involved in the python's lunch conjecture (PLC), and their areas are used to compute the restricted complexity $\mathcal{C}$ of decoding the Hawking radiation. The results are compared to the time-dependent predictions of the PLC.</description>

      <title>On the Gaussian Assumption in the Estimation of Parameters for Dark Energy Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae have provided fundamental observational data in the discovery of the late acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in cosmology. However, this analysis has relied on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for the data, a hypothesis that can be challenged with the increasing volume and precision of available supernova data. In this work, we rigorously assess this Gaussianity hypothesis and analyze its impact on parameter estimation for dark energy cosmological models. We utilize the Pantheon+ dataset and perform a comprehensive statistical, analysis including the Lilliefors and Jarque-Bera tests, to assess the normality of both the data and model residuals. We find that the Gaussianity assumption is untenable and that the redshift distribution is more accurately described by a t-distribution, as indicated by the Kolmogorov Smirnov test. Parameters are estimated for a model incorporating a nonlinear cosmological interaction for the dark sector. The free parameters are estimated using multiple methods, and bootstrap confidence intervals are constructed for them.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Newton-Cartan Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-relativistic Newton-Cartan limit of higher-order gravity theories in arbitrary dimensions. We first study it at the level of the action by introducing an additional 1-form gauge field and coupling it appropriately to the gravity sector. We extend this procedure to any theory whose Lagrangian is a function of the Ricci scalar, quadratic Ricci tensor and quadratic Riemann tensor. We also study the limit of the equations of motion for two models, Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and quadratic Ricci scalar theory. We prove that, in the first case, it is possible to obtain the Poisson equation by introducing a scalar field and imposing an appropriate constraint. In the latter case, we show that it is possible to get the Poisson equation from the limit of the equations of motion as long as the on-shell constraint used in the two-derivative theory is supplemented with a further condition. We give the expressions of the two higher-order corrected Poisson equations in terms of curvatures of Newton-Cartan geometry. In both cases, we derive the full set of non-relativistic equations and study their boost transformations. The two sets of equations of motion define zero-torsion Gauss-Bonnet Newton-Cartan gravity and zero-torsion quadratic Ricci scalar Newton-Cartan gravity.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Rockets and Gaia Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the spin-aligned electromagnetic recoil force acting on a pulsar vanishes identically in Force-Free Electrodynamics. This contrasts with Hirai et al.'s recent argument that the rocket effect was important for explaining the eccentricity distribution of wide neutron star binaries found by Gaia. Our detailed analysis confirms that for a broad range of initial conditions and natal kick distributions, the rocket velocities of $v_r \gtrsim 30\, \mathrm{km/s}$ are required to account for the observed eccentricities. However, we find that in scenarios where the common envelope phase does not significantly shrink the initial orbit, and the natal kicks are drawn from Paczynski-type distribution, these eccentricities may arise without the influence of an EM rocket. If the natal kicks are perpendicular to the initial orbits, then explaining the Gaia neutron star eccentricities without invoking rockets additionally requires that the pre-supernova binaries avoid significant circularization, and that the mass loss during the supernova is minimal.
  The rocket effect can only be substantial in "weak" pulsars, where pair production near the light cylinder is suppressed and ${\bf E}\cdot{\bf B} \neq 0$ in the outer magnetosphere. We derive a rough estimate for a rocket force in a weak pulsar and relate it to the pulsar's radiative efficiency; simulations are needed to obtain numerically reliable expressions. If future observations prove that rockets are required to explain the data, this would imply that Gaia neutron stars are $\gtrsim $ Myr old, were previously rapidly spinning and are weakly magnetized, with a dipole field $\lesssim 10^{10}$ G and a relatively strong quadrupole component.</description>

      <title>Confronting Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation-of-State with ACT-DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a simple yet effective semi-analytical approach to confront Mukhanov Parametrization of inflationary equation-of-state, $1+\omega =\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, with the latest ACT-DR6 data employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that equation-of-state formalism comes up with excellent fit to the latest data. In the process we are also able to put stringent constraint on the two model parameters. In order to get the bounds of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have also made use of the recent finding $r&lt;0.032$. We have further utilized results from the joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to find the observationally viable region for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have also employed the predictions on primordial gravity waves from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD along with results from the combination of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to further restrict the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us narrow the viable parameter space for Mukhanov parametrization. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity waves signal by those CMB missions parameter space is reduced significantly for $\beta$, while the range for $\alpha$ is slightly increased. In addition we observe that, $\alpha$ is primarily dependent on the observationally viable range for scalar spectral index while other model parameter $\beta$ is resting heavily on the restriction upon the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. We find that equation-of-state formalism has a wide range of parameter values consistent with recent observational data set along with futuristic CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of spin connections on three-dimensional homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we aim to classify and characterize the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections and homogeneous $SU(2)$ connections on three-dimensional Riemannian homogeneous spaces. An analysis of the topology of the associated moduli spaces reveals that they are finite-dimensional topological manifolds (possibly with boundary) possessing trivial homotopy groups.
  Owing to their deep connection with cosmological models in the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi formulation of General Relativity, this study offers a mathematically rigorous interpretation of the Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi-Sen connection within a cosmological context. In particular, we show that a correct formulation of the theory relies crucially on identifying the moduli space of homogeneous spin connections, thereby emphasizing the essential role of the spin structure in ensuring consistency with the physical content of the theory.
  The favorable topological properties of these moduli spaces circumvent many of the usual difficulties associated with singularities and the definition of regular measures in Quantum Field Theory and Quantum Gravity. As a result, they provide a solid foundation for the rigorous implementation of quantum theory in the cosmological setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was discovered in recent months that the anti-de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds involved in all familiar top-down examples of AdS/CFT duality follow from applying a transverse nonrelativistic brane limit to string/M theory on (asymptotically) flat spacetime. In this note we show that an exactly analogous statement holds for de Sitter (dS) backgrounds relevant to particular instances of dS/CFT duality, which are obtained via a longitudinal Carrollian brane limit. This statement makes direct contact with the holographic duality inferred by Hull via temporal T-duality.</description>

      <title>Investigating the imprint of quintessence in cosmic magnification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmic magnification beyond lensing in a late-time universe dominated by quintessence and cold dark matter. The cosmic magnification angular power spectrum, especially going beyond the well-known lensing effect, provides an independent avenue for investigating the properties of quintessence, and hence, dark energy. By analysing the magnification power spectrum at different redshifts, it is possible to extract new information about the large-scale imprint of dark energy, including whether we are able to disentangle different models from one another. Using three well-known quintessence models, we analyse the cosmic magnification angular power spectrum while taking relativistic corrections into account. We found that it will be difficult to distinguish between quintessence models, and quintessence from the cosmological constant, in lensing magnification angular power spectrum on large scales, at redshifts $z \,{\leq}\, 1$; whereas, when relativistic corrections are incorporated, the total magnification angular power spectrum holds the potential to distinguish between the models, at the given $z$. At $z \,{\geq}\, 3$, the lensing magnification angular power spectrum can be a reasonable approximation of the total magnification angular power spectrum. We also found that both the total relativistic and the Doppler magnification signals, respectively, surpass cosmic variance at $z \,{\leq}\, 0.5$: hence the effect may be detectable at the given $z$. On the other hand, the ISW and the time-delay magnification signals, respectively, are surpassed by cosmic variance on all scales, at epochs up to $z \,{=}\, 4.5$, with the gravitational-potential magnification signal being zero.</description>

Abstract: We propose and solve mathematically a simple euclidean model for quantum gravity in one dimension. In the case of an open curve, the continuum limit is trivial, that is, the size of the universe is infinite, independently of the value of the cosmological constant. Nevertheless, it is nontrivial in the closed case, resulting in a finite size universe for positive cosmological constant. The presence of a scalar field slightly changes this last result, regardless of the mass. We also discuss a generalization of our model for higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07782v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work discusses the Improved Matrix Method and Weighted Residual Method for studying the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes. In the first method, by utilizing Jordan decomposition, the improved matrix method avoids the calculation of inverse matrices in the original matrix method. This significantly saves computational resources and time needed to compute the coefficient square matrices of the derivatives. In the second method, we illustrate the effectiveness of the weighted residual method in QNMs calculations by using the collocation method and Galerkin method as examples. We compared the results of both methods with the Generalized Horowitz-Hubeny Method and the WKB approximation. The methods proposed in this paper demonstrates superior precision. Additionally, we provide five criteria to exclude extraneous roots from the methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04161v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of achieving post-inflationary reheating exclusively through the gravitational interaction in Starobinsky inflation, which itself assumes nothing but gravity. We consider the possibility that the reheating sector couples to gravity via a non-minimal coupling. Our analysis is performed both in a perturbative and in a non-perturbative approach, where particle production is computed from Bogoliubov coefficients. Our findings indicate that, for a minimal coupling, a reheating temperature $T_\text{reh}\sim 10^{8}$~GeV is obtained, with a reheating duration of approximately 21 $e$-folds. We also show that non perturbative gravitational production during preheating can lead to maximum temperatures of the order of $10^{12}$ GeV. This shows that the gravitational interaction could be the sole responsible for reheating the Universe after inflation, without the need to assume other \emph{ad hoc} inflaton interactions.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the spinning LQG black hole can act as a cosmic particle accelerator. The LQG solution is singularity-free and can possess spin greater than that of a Kerr black hole. The additional black hole hair, arising from quantum effects, significantly influences the particle dynamics around the black hole. Under suitable physical conditions, the center-of-mass energy can grow arbitrarily high during the collision of two generic particles in the spacetime of an extremal black hole. In the non-extremal case, there exists a finite upper bound on the center-of-mass energy, the maximum value of which depends on the LQG parameter. These results are particularly interesting from an astrophysical perspective, especially in the context of probing Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Perturbative black-hole and horizon solutions in gravity with explicit spacetime-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present static and spherically symmetric vacuum solutions to the mass-dimension $d\leq 4$ action of an effective-field theory, choosing the diffeomorphism symmetry to be broken explicitly. By using the reduced-action method with a Schwarzschild seed-solution, we find static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions to the field equations to linear order in the symmetry-breaking coefficients, which are consistent solutions to the modified Einstein equations at the same order. Using several ans\"atze for the symmetry-breaking coefficient we classify the allowed solutions, and we compute standard consequences and observables, including horizons, thermodynamics, photon geodesics, and perihelion precession. We find that the horizon structure of some of our solutions are similar to the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, and that several of them exhibit physical singularities at $r=2M$. We note in particular that introducing more than one non-zero coefficient for spacetime-symmetry breaking coefficient leads to a solution with three horizons; the aim is to obtain observables that can be confronted to black holes observational data.</description>

      <title>New interpretation of the original charged BTZ black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal 1992 paper, Ba\~{n}ados, Teitelboim and Zanelli (BTZ) proposed a simple charged generalization of what is now known as the spinning BTZ black hole, the proposal being that a rotating metric can be supported by a `static vector' potential. While with such an ansatz the Einstein equations are satisfied, and the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is divergence-less, the Maxwell equations do not (due to the special degenerate form of the corresponding field strength) hold. More recently, Deshpande and Lunin have proposed a generalized `Einstein--Maxwell' system which yields analytic rotating black holes in all odd dimensions. In this paper, we show that the original charged BTZ solution can be re-interpreted as a solution of the Deshpande--Lunin theory. Moreover, as we shall explicitly illustrate on an example of regularized conformal electrodynamics, similar construction also works for any non-linear electrodynamics in 3-dimensions. At the same time, all these spacetimes represent self-gravitating solutions of (NLE generalized) force-free electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Gravity as emergent phenomena for spherically symmetric black hole accretion of multi-component flow with relativistic equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate analogue gravity phenomena arising as a result of the linear perturbation of the spherically symmetric accretion flows onto non rotating black holes, where the gravitational field is determined by a set of post Newtonian pseudo Schwarzschild black hole potentials and the infaling matter is described by a relativistic multi-species equation of state. The stationary transonic integral accretion solutions corresponding to the steady state of aforementioned type of accreting systems are constructed and the stability analysis of such solutions are performed through the time dependent linear perturbation of the accretion flow. Such linear stability analysis leads to the formation of a black hole like sonic metric embedded within the infalling matter. The acoustic horizons are then identified by constructing the causal structure, i.e., the Carter-Penrose diagrams. The variation of the analogue surface gravity corresponding to the aforementioned sonic metric has been studied as a function of various parameters governing the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Modified Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs), second-order tensor modes sourced by first-order scalar fluctuations in General Relativity (GR), are expected to contribute to the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) potentially detectable by current and future gravitational wave interferometers. In the framework of GR, this SGWB represents an unavoidable contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum. In this paper, we go beyond GR and we investigate the behavior of SIGWs in f(R) gravity. We explore how the SIGW spectrum is influenced across a broad range of frequencies, from the nano-Hz regime, where the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) operates, through the milli-Hz band probed by the space-based LISA detector, up to the kilo-Hz frequency range, where the ground-based LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA network is currently operational. Our results indicate that the beyond-GR correction leaves an observational imprint, mainly in the low-frequency part of the spectrum, giving the possibility to use SIGW to constrain GR on scales on which we have limited information.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Born-Infeld boson compact objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study gravitationally bound compact objects sourced by a string theory inspired Born-Infeld scalar field. Unlike many of their canonical scalar field counterparts, these ``boson stars'' do not have to extend out to infinity and may generate compact bodies. We analyze in detail both the junction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the center which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the object and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although involved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that these compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars and some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are several branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are realized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions tend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes, and also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface compactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made arbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some comments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable and unstable regimes. However, we argue that even in the possibly stable regime the event horizon in the vacuum region shielding the object is potentially unstable, and would cut off the star from the rest of the universe.</description>

      <title>Measuring the cosmic dipole with golden dark sirens in the era of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12678v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tensions between cosmological parameter measurements from the early-universe and the late-universe datasets offer an exciting opportunity to explore new physics, if not accounted for unknown systematics. Apart from the well-known Hubble tension, a tension up to $4.9 \sigma$ in the cosmic dipole has also been reported. While the cosmic dipole is mainly induced by the observer's kinetic motion, an intrinsic dipole arising from the anisotropy of the universe could also play an import role. Such an intrinsic anisotropy can be a dark energy mimicker that causes the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. As a new and powerful tool, gravitational waves can serve as an independent probe to the cosmic dipole. A useful type of events to achieve this is the "golden dark sirens", which are near-by well-localized compact binary coalescences whose host galaxies can be identified directly due to precise localization. By forecasting golden dark sirens obtained from 10-year observations using different possible detector networks in the future, we find that the standard LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors are not able to detect a meaningful amount of golden dark sirens, and hence next-generation ground-based detectors are essential to obtain a strong constraint on the cosmic dipole. In particular, we find that a three-detector network consisting of more than one next-generation detectors can yield a constraint on the cosmic dipole at an order of $10^{-3}$ when jointly measured with $H_0$. Moreover, a constraint on the cosmic dipole at an order of $10^{-4}$ can be achieved when fixing $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Quantum parameter-mass induced scalarization of qOS-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain quantum parameter ($\alpha$)-mass ($M$) induced spontaneous scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the unknown qOS action.
  We derive Smarr formula which describes a correct thermodynamics for the bald qOS-black hole.
  It is turned out that two Davies points of heat capacity are identified with two critical onset mass and quantum parameter for spontaneous scalarization.
  However, we do not obtain such connections from the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory with the nonlinear electrodynamics action.
  Furthermore, the shadow radius analysis of qOS-black hole is performed to distinguish quantum parameter from mass by comparing them with the EHT observation.
  There is no constraints on the quantum parameter, but new constraints are found for the mass.
  This work is considered as the first example to show a close connection between thermodynamics of bald black hole and spontaneous scalarization.</description>

      <title>Axial quasi-normal modes of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity to second-order in spin and coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies of slowly rotating black holes in dynamical Chern-Simons (dCS) gravity, including corrections up to second order in the black hole's dimensionless spin parameter $\chi = J/M^2$ and second order in the dCS coupling parameter ($\alpha$). Due to the complexities of constructing a Newman-Penrose tetrad at this order, we employ a metric perturbation approach. We derive a system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the primary axial $l$-mode and the polar $l\pm 1$ modes, which is then solved numerically with appropriate ingoing and outgoing wave boundary conditions. Our numerical framework is validated in the General Relativistic limit against known Schwarzschild QNMs and highly accurate Kerr QNM results for $\chi \leq 0.15$. For the fundamental $n=0, l=m=2$ axial mode, we present detailed numerical results illustrating the dependence of QNM frequencies on both $\chi$ and $\alpha$. We observe that while rotation generally increases the damping time, increasing the dCS coupling parameter significantly reduces the damping time of the axial mode. This finding contrasts with previous analytical work on polar modes, which suggested an increase in damping time due to dCS effects, highlighting a crucial parity-dependent difference in how dCS gravity impacts black hole ringdowns. Furthermore, we provide an analytical fitting formula for this mode. These results, incorporating coupled spin and dCS effects at second order, provide more accurate theoretical predictions for testing dCS gravity with gravitational wave observations of black hole ringdowns. The refined QNM calculations are particularly relevant for lower-mass black hole merger events, such as GW230529, where dCS corrections may be more prominent and their distinct damping signatures could be observable.

      <title>Phase space and data analyses of a nonminimally coupled scalar field system with a decaying dark energy model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of scalar field dark energy models nonminimally coupled to gravity, characterized by a double exponential potential and parameterized coupling {\xi}. We study the cosmological dynamics for a recently proposed descending dark energy model, namely, Q-SC-CDM. Initially, we choose distinct values of coupling parameter. For some values of {\xi}, the evolution of the universe is split up into three different phases: decelerated expansion (early time), accelerated expansion (late-time) and slow-contraction (future era), and provide Big Crunch Singularity at distant future. In other scenario, the phase of slow-contraction vanishes, cosmic acceleration is obtained at current epoch, and the universe gets de-Sitter expansion at distant future. It is remarkable to see that the Big Crunch Singularity is redundant in the later case. Next, we investigate the phase space analysis for the model under consideration. Our investigation brings new asymptotic regimes and finds stable de-Sitter solution. Eventually, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using recent cosmological observations, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae (Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR), and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (DESI DR2) data. The results demonstrate that the present model yield constraints on key cosmological parameters \Omega_{0m}, H_0 and the sound horizon r_d that are consistent with {\Lambda}CDM within 68\% confidence level, yet exhibit mild tension with Pantheon+ measurements. Additionally, we employ the Om(z) diagnostic test, Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria to distinguish our model from {\Lambda}CDM. The Statistical comparison reveals moderate support for the current model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the late-time acceleration of the Universe is one of the major challenges in cosmology today. In this paper, we present a new scalar field model corresponding to a generalised axion-like potential. In fact, this model can be framed as a quintessence model based on physically motivated considerations. This potential is capable of alleviating the coincidence problem through a tracking regime. We will as well prove that this potential allows for a late-time acceleration period induced by an effective cosmological constant, which is reached without fine-tuning the initial conditions of the scalar field. In our model, the generalised axion field fuels the late-time acceleration of the Universe rather than fuelling an early dark energy era. Additionally, we will show how the late-time transition to dark energy dominance could be favoured in this model, since the density parameter of the scalar field will rapidly grow in the late phase of the tracking regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes are one of the important sources for the TianQin gravitational wave project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio of inspiral binary black holes can be computed analytically. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for binary black holes. In this paper, we demonstrated the signal-to-noise ratio relationships from stellar-mass black holes to massive black holes. With the all-sky average condition, the signal-to-noise ratio for most binary black hole signals can be determined with a relative error of $\lesssim10\%$, with notable deviations only for chirp masses near $1000~M_\odot$. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio without the average includes an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a straightforward estimation method with an error margin of $1\sigma$ within 2\%.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the E-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generation of gravitational waves in the E-model inflation with the scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Considering a wall-crossing behavior in the moduli space, we parameterize the coupling coefficient $\xi$ as a step-like function, then if $V_{,\phi}\xi_{,\phi}&gt;0$, the Gauss-Bonnet term dominate the inflation dynamics, causing a short rapid-decline phase of the inflaton, and for appropriate parameter spaces, the mode equation of tensor perturbations develops a transient growing solution. This process generates a peak in the tensor perturbation power spectrum, corresponding to a peak in the gravitational wave energy spectrum around the nanohertz frequency band. Further more, we investigate the feasibility of generating double peaks in the gravitational wave spectrum using a double-step coupling, For certain parameter choices, one peak lies near nanohertz frequencies, while the other is around millihertz frequencies. Consequently, these gravitational waves can be observed by the pulsar timing array and the space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Over-Luminous Type Ia Supernovae and Standard Candle Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) serve as crucial cosmological distance indicators because of their empirical consistency in peak luminosity and characteristic light curve decline rates. These properties facilitate them to be standardized candles for the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) within late-time universe cosmology. Nevertheless, a statistically significant difference persists between $H_0$ values derived from early and late-time measurements, a phenomenon known as the Hubble tension. Furthermore, recent observations have identified a subset of over-luminous SNe Ia, characterized by peak luminosities exceeding the nominal range and faster decline rates. These discoveries raise questions regarding the reliability of SNe Ia as standard candles for measuring cosmological distances. In this article, we present the Bayesian analysis of eight over-luminous SNe Ia and show that they yield a lower $H_0$ estimate, exhibiting closer concordance with $H_0$ estimates derived from early-universe data. This investigation potentially represents a step toward addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>On the geometric origin of the energy-momentum tensor improvement terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a flat background, the canonical energy momentum tensor of Lorentz and conformally invariant matter field theories can be improved to a symmetric and traceless tensor that gives the same conserved charges. We argue that the geometric origin of this improvement process is unveiled when the matter theory is coupled to Metric-Affine Gravity. In particular, we show that the Belinfante-Rosenfeld improvement terms correspond to the matter theory's hypermomentum. The improvement terms in conformally invariant matter theories are also related to the hypermomentum however a general proof would require an extended investigation. We demonstrate our results through various examples, such as the free massless scalar, the Maxwell field, Abelian $p$-forms, the Dirac field and a non-unitary massless scalar field. Possible applications of our method for theories that break Lorentz or special conformal invariance are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the reheating dynamics of $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability and Critical Exponents of the Neutral (S-type) Gubser-Rocha Model with Momentum Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (S-type) Gubser-Rocha model is a holographic model that shows the linear dependence of the entropy density on the temperature. With an appropriate choice of the boundary action, this model exhibits a continuous phase transition in the neutral limit. In this paper, we investigate several aspects of this phase transition. Firstly, we show that the critical exponents of the phase transition match those in the mean-field percolation theory. Subsequently, we also investigate the dynamical stability, and the emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes by analyzing the quasinormal modes of the perturbation fields. The dynamical stability agrees with the thermodynamic stability. In addition, we find that there is an emergent Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase of the S-type model.</description>

      <title>Constraints are not enough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean Einstein-Hilbert action is well-known to be unbounded below and thus to raise many questions regarding the definition of the gravitational path integral. A variety of works since the late 1980's have suggested that this problem disappears when one fixes a foliation of the spacetime and imposes the corresponding gravitational constraints. However, we show here that this approach fails with various classes of boundary conditions imposed on the foliation: compact slices without boundary, asymptotically flat, or asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter slices. We also discuss the idea of fixing the scalar curvature and Wick-rotating the conformal factor, and show that it also fails to produce an action bounded from below.</description>

      <title>Predicting wide binaries and deviations from standard gravity using machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) framework for the detection of wide binary star systems and the identification of deviations from standard gravity using Gaia DR3 data. By training supervised ML models on established wide binary catalogues, we efficiently classify wide binaries and employ clustering and nearest neighbour search to pair candidate systems. We recast the problem of identifying systematic deviations from standard gravity as a supervised anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates data preprocessing techniques such as SMOTE, correlation analysis, and PCA, and achieves high accuracy and recall in both binary classification and anomaly detection tasks. The resulting publicly available code enables rapid, scalable, and customizable analysis of wide binaries and gravitational anomalies, complementing conventional analyses and providing a valuable resource for future astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Superrotations are Linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that superrotations can be described using the geometric conformal completion method of Penrose. In particular, superrotation charges can be described and calculated using the linkage method of Geroch and Winicour.
  Whether superrotation charges are calculated using the coordinate based Bondi formalism or the geometric Penrose formalism, the fact that the superrotation blows up at a point makes the superrotation charge formally ill defined. Nonetheless, we show that it can be made well defined through a regularization procedure devised by Flanagan and Nichols.</description>
