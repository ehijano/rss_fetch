      <title>Hierarchical Federated Graph Attention Networks for Scalable and Resilient UAV Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-time performance, adversarial resiliency, and privacy preservation are the most important metrics that need to be balanced to practice collision avoidance in large-scale multi-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems. Current frameworks tend to prescribe monolithic solutions that are not only prohibitively computationally complex with a scaling cost of $O(n^2)$ but simply do not offer Byzantine fault tolerance. The proposed hierarchical framework presented in this paper tries to eliminate such trade-offs by stratifying a three-layered architecture. We spread the intelligence into three layers: an immediate collision avoiding local layer running on dense graph attention with latency of $&lt;10 ms$, a regional layer using sparse attention with $O(nk)$ computational complexity and asynchronous federated learning with coordinate-wise trimmed mean aggregation, and lastly, a global layer using a lightweight Hashgraph-inspired protocol. We have proposed an adaptive differential privacy mechanism, wherein the noise level $(\epsilon \in [0.1, 1.0])$ is dynamically reduced based on an evaluation of the measured real-time threat that in turn maximized the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through the use of Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based lightweight audit logging instead of heavyweight blockchain consensus, the median cost of getting a $95^{th}$ percentile decision within 50ms is observed across all tested swarm sizes. This architecture provides a scalable scenario of 500 UAVs with a collision rate of $&lt; 2.0\%$ and the Byzantine fault tolerance of $f &lt; n/3$.</description>

      <title>Tactile Data Recording System for Clothing with Motion-Controlled Robotic Sliding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tactile sensation of clothing is critical to wearer comfort. To reveal physical properties that make clothing comfortable, systematic collection of tactile data during sliding motion is required. We propose a robotic arm-based system for collecting tactile data from intact garments. The system performs stroking measurements with a simulated fingertip while precisely controlling speed and direction, enabling creation of motion-labeled, multimodal tactile databases. Machine learning evaluation showed that including motion-related parameters improved identification accuracy for audio and acceleration data, demonstrating the efficacy of motion-related labels for characterizing clothing tactile sensation. This system provides a scalable, non-destructive method for capturing tactile data of clothing, contributing to future studies on fabric perception and reproduction.</description>

      <title>Image-based Morphological Characterization of Filamentous Biological Structures with Non-constant Curvature Shape Feature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tendrils coil their shape to anchor the plant to supporting structures, allowing vertical growth toward light. Although climbing plants have been studied for a long time, extracting information regarding the relationship between the temporal shape change, the event that triggers it, and the contact location is still challenging. To help build this relation, we propose an image-based method by which it is possible to analyze shape changes over time in tendrils when mechano-stimulated in different portions of their body. We employ a geometric approach using a 3D Piece-Wise Clothoid-based model to reconstruct the configuration taken by a tendril after mechanical rubbing. The reconstruction shows high robustness and reliability with an accuracy of R2 &gt; 0.99. This method demonstrates distinct advantages over deep learning-based approaches, including reduced data requirements, lower computational costs, and interpretability. Our analysis reveals higher responsiveness in the apical segment of tendrils, which might correspond to higher sensitivity and tissue flexibility in that region of the organs. Our study provides a methodology for gaining new insights into plant biomechanics and offers a foundation for designing and developing novel intelligent robotic systems inspired by climbing plants.</description>

      <title>ExpertAD: Enhancing Autonomous Driving Systems with Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in end-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs) underscore their potential for perception and planning capabilities. However, challenges remain. Complex driving scenarios contain rich semantic information, yet ambiguous or noisy semantics can compromise decision reliability, while interference between multiple driving tasks may hinder optimal planning. Furthermore, prolonged inference latency slows decision-making, increasing the risk of unsafe driving behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ExpertAD, a novel framework that enhances the performance of ADS with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. We introduce a Perception Adapter (PA) to amplify task-critical features, ensuring contextually relevant scene understanding, and a Mixture of Sparse Experts (MoSE) to minimize task interference during prediction, allowing for effective and efficient planning. Our experiments show that ExpertAD reduces average collision rates by up to 20% and inference latency by 25% compared to prior methods. We further evaluate its multi-skill planning capabilities in rare scenarios (e.g., accidents, yielding to emergency vehicles) and demonstrate strong generalization to unseen urban environments. Additionally, we present a case study that illustrates its decision-making process in complex driving scenarios.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models and 3D Vision for Intelligent Robotic Perception and Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11777v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and robotics, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with 3D vision is emerging as a transformative approach to enhancing robotic sensing technologies. This convergence enables machines to perceive, reason and interact with complex environments through natural language and spatial understanding, bridging the gap between linguistic intelligence and spatial perception. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies, applications and challenges at the intersection of LLMs and 3D vision, with a focus on next-generation robotic sensing technologies. We first introduce the foundational principles of LLMs and 3D data representations, followed by an in-depth examination of 3D sensing technologies critical for robotics. The review then explores key advancements in scene understanding, text-to-3D generation, object grounding and embodied agents, highlighting cutting-edge techniques such as zero-shot 3D segmentation, dynamic scene synthesis and language-guided manipulation. Furthermore, we discuss multimodal LLMs that integrate 3D data with touch, auditory and thermal inputs, enhancing environmental comprehension and robotic decision-making. To support future research, we catalog benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for 3D-language and vision tasks. Finally, we identify key challenges and future research directions, including adaptive model architectures, enhanced cross-modal alignment and real-time processing capabilities, which pave the way for more intelligent, context-aware and autonomous robotic sensing systems.</description>

      <title>LAVQA: A Latency-Aware Visual Question Answering Framework for Shared Autonomy in Self-Driving Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When uncertainty is high, self-driving vehicles may halt for safety and benefit from the access to remote human operators who can provide high-level guidance. This paradigm, known as {shared autonomy}, enables autonomous vehicle and remote human operators to jointly formulate appropriate responses. To address critical decision timing with variable latency due to wireless network delays and human response time, we present LAVQA, a latency-aware shared autonomy framework that integrates Visual Question Answering (VQA) and spatiotemporal risk visualization. LAVQA augments visual queries with Latency-Induced COllision Map (LICOM), a dynamically evolving map that represents both temporal latency and spatial uncertainty. It enables remote operator to observe as the vehicle safety regions vary over time in the presence of dynamic obstacles and delayed responses. Closed-loop simulations in CARLA, the de-facto standard for autonomous vehicle simulator, suggest that that LAVQA can reduce collision rates by over 8x compared to latency-agnostic baselines.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Underwater Cognitive System for Adaptive Navigation: A SLAM-Integrated Cognitive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-sea exploration poses significant challenges, including disorientation, communication loss, and navigational failures in dynamic underwater environments. This paper presents an Autonomous Underwater Cognitive System (AUCS) that integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a Soar-based cognitive architecture to enable adaptive navigation in complex oceanic conditions. The system fuses multi-sensor data from SONAR, LiDAR, IMU, and DVL with cognitive reasoning modules for perception, attention, planning, and learning. Unlike conventional SLAM systems, AUCS incorporates semantic understanding, adaptive sensor management, and memory-based learning to differentiate between dynamic and static objects, reducing false loop closures and enhancing long-term map consistency. The proposed architecture demonstrates a complete perception-cognition-action-learning loop, allowing autonomous underwater vehicles to sense, reason, and adapt intelligently. This work lays a foundation for next-generation cognitive submersible systems, improving safety, reliability, and autonomy in deep-sea exploration.</description>

      <title>MATT-Diff: Multimodal Active Target Tracking by Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes MATT-Diff: Multi-Modal Active Target Tracking by Diffusion Policy, a control policy that captures multiple behavioral modes - exploration, dedicated tracking, and target reacquisition - for active multi-target tracking. The policy enables agent control without prior knowledge of target numbers, states, or dynamics. Effective target tracking demands balancing exploration for undetected or lost targets with following the motion of detected but uncertain ones. We generate a demonstration dataset from three expert planners including frontier-based exploration, an uncertainty-based hybrid planner switching between frontier-based exploration and RRT* tracking based on target uncertainty, and a time-based hybrid planner switching between exploration and tracking based on target detection time. We design a control policy utilizing a vision transformer for egocentric map tokenization and an attention mechanism to integrate variable target estimates represented by Gaussian densities. Trained as a diffusion model, the policy learns to generate multi-modal action sequences through a denoising process. Evaluations demonstrate MATT-Diff's superior tracking performance against expert and behavior cloning baselines across multiple target motions, empirically validating its advantages in target tracking.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Evaluation of Screw-Based Locomotion Across Aquatic, Granular, and Transitional Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Screw-based propulsion systems offer promising capabilities for amphibious mobility, yet face significant challenges in optimizing locomotion across water, granular materials, and transitional environments. This study presents a systematic investigation into the locomotion performance of various screw configurations in media such as dry sand, wet sand, saturated sand, and water. Through a principles-first approach to analyze screw performance, it was found that certain parameters are dominant in their impact on performance. Depending on the media, derived parameters inspired from optimizing heat sink design help categorize performance within the dominant design parameters. Our results provide specific insights into screw shell design and adaptive locomotion strategies to enhance the performance of screw-based propulsion systems for versatile amphibious applications.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped LLM Semantics for Context-Aware Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompting robots with natural language (NL) has largely been studied as what task to execute (goal selection, skill sequencing) rather than how to execute that task safely and efficiently in semantically rich, human-centric spaces. We address this gap with a framework that turns a large language model (LLM) into a stochastic semantic sensor whose outputs modulate a classical planner. Given a prompt and a semantic map, we draw multiple LLM "danger" judgments and apply a Bayesian bootstrap to approximate a posterior over per-class risk. Using statistics from the posterior, we create a potential cost to formulate a path planning problem. Across simulated environments and a BIM-backed digital twin, our method adapts how the robot moves in response to explicit prompts and implicit contextual information. We present qualitative and quantitative results.</description>

      <title>ARCSnake V2: An Amphibious Multi-Domain Screw-Propelled Snake-Like Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic exploration in extreme environments such as caves, oceans, and planetary surfaces pose significant challenges, particularly in locomotion across diverse terrains. Conventional wheeled or legged robots often struggle in these contexts due to surface variability. This paper presents ARCSnake V2, an amphibious, screw propelled, snake like robot designed for teleoperated or autonomous locomotion across land, granular media, and aquatic environments. ARCSnake V2 combines the high mobility of hyper redundant snake robots with the terrain versatility of Archimedean screw propulsion. Key contributions include a water sealed mechanical design with serially linked screw and joint actuation, an integrated buoyancy control system, and teleoperation via a kinematically matched handheld controller. The robots design and control architecture enable multiple locomotion modes screwing, wheeling, and sidewinding with smooth transitions between them. Extensive experiments validate its underwater maneuverability, communication robustness, and force regulated actuation. These capabilities position ARCSnake V2 as a versatile platform for exploration, search and rescue, and environmental monitoring in multi domain settings.</description>

      <title>SBAMP: Sampling Based Adaptive Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems must navigate complex, dynamic environments in real time, often facing unpredictable obstacles and rapidly changing conditions. Traditional sampling-based methods, such as RRT*, excel at generating collision-free paths but struggle to adapt to sudden changes without extensive replanning. Conversely, learning-based dynamical systems, such as the Stable Estimator of Dynamical Systems (SEDS), offer smooth, adaptive trajectory tracking but typically rely on pre-collected demonstration data, limiting their generalization to novel scenarios. This paper introduces Sampling-Based Adaptive Motion Planning (SBAMP), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating RRT* for global path planning with a SEDS-based local controller for continuous, adaptive trajectory adjustment. Our approach requires no pre-trained datasets and ensures smooth transitions between planned waypoints, maintaining stability through Lyapunov-based guarantees. We validate SBAMP in both simulated environments and real hardware using the RoboRacer platform, demonstrating superior performance in dynamic obstacle scenarios, rapid recovery from perturbations, and robust handling of sharp turns. Experimental results highlight SBAMP's ability to adapt in real time without sacrificing global path optimality, providing a scalable solution for dynamic, unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Action Head: Confining Task Knowledge to Conditioning Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a data-driven supervised learning approach that has gained increasing attention with the success of scaling laws in language and vision domains. Among its implementations in robotic manipulation, Diffusion Policy (DP), with its two variants DP-CNN (DP-C) and DP-Transformer (DP-T), is one of the most effective and widely adopted models, demonstrating the advantages of predicting continuous action sequences. However, both DP and other BC methods remain constrained by the scarcity of paired training data, and the internal mechanisms underlying DP's effectiveness remain insufficiently understood, leading to limited generalization and a lack of principled design in model development. In this work, we propose a decoupled training recipe that leverages nearly cost-free kinematics-generated trajectories as observation-free data to pretrain a general action head (action generator). The pretrained action head is then frozen and adapted to novel tasks through feature modulation. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. As an additional benefit, decoupling improves training efficiency; for instance, DP-C achieves up to a 41% speedup. Furthermore, the confinement of task-specific knowledge to the conditioning components under decoupling, combined with the near-identical performance of DP-C in both normal and decoupled training, indicates that the action generation backbone plays a limited role in robotic manipulation. Motivated by this observation, we introduce DP-MLP, which replaces the 244M-parameter U-Net backbone of DP-C with only 4M parameters of simple MLP blocks, achieving a 83.9% faster training speed under normal training and 89.1% under decoupling.</description>

      <title>Towards Obstacle-Avoiding Control of Planar Snake Robots Exploring Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to develop a resource-efficient solution for obstacle-avoiding tracking control of a planar snake robot in a densely cluttered environment with obstacles. Particularly, Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) has been employed to generate dynamic gait parameters for the serpenoid gait function, which is implemented on the joint angles of the snake robot, thus controlling the robot on a desired dynamic path. NEAT is a single neural-network based evolutionary algorithm that is known to work extremely well when the input layer is of significantly higher dimension and the output layer is of a smaller size. For the planar snake robot, the input layer consists of the joint angles, link positions, head link position as well as obstacle positions in the vicinity. However, the output layer consists of only the frequency and offset angle of the serpenoid gait that control the speed and heading of the robot, respectively. Obstacle data from a LiDAR and the robot data from various sensors, along with the location of the end goal and time, are employed to parametrize a reward function that is maximized over iterations by selective propagation of superior neural networks. The implementation and experimental results showcase that the proposed approach is computationally efficient, especially for large environments with many obstacles. The proposed framework has been verified through a physics engine simulation study on PyBullet. The approach shows superior results to existing state-of-the-art methodologies and comparable results to the very recent CBRL approach with significantly lower computational overhead.

      <title>Game-Theoretic Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Reachability Analysis for Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safe, robust, and scalable motion planning for multi-agent systems in dynamic and uncertain environments is a persistent challenge, driven by complex inter-agent interactions, stochastic disturbances, and model uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, particularly the computational complexity of coupled decision-making and the need for proactive safety guarantees, we propose a Reachability-Enhanced Dynamic Potential Game (RE-DPG) framework, which integrates game-theoretic coordination into reachability analysis. This approach formulates multi-agent coordination as a dynamic potential game, where the Nash equilibrium (NE) defines optimal control strategies across agents. To enable scalability and decentralized execution, we develop a Neighborhood-Dominated iterative Best Response (ND-iBR) scheme, built upon an iterated $\varepsilon$-BR (i$\varepsilon$-BR) process that guarantees finite-step convergence to an $\varepsilon$-NE. This allows agents to compute strategies based on local interactions while ensuring theoretical convergence guarantees. Furthermore, to ensure safety under uncertainty, we integrate a Multi-Agent Forward Reachable Set (MA-FRS) mechanism into the cost function, explicitly modeling uncertainty propagation and enforcing collision avoidance constraints. Through both simulations and real-world experiments in 2D and 3D environments, we validate the effectiveness of RE-DPG across diverse operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Variable Impedance Control for Floating-Base Supernumerary Robotic Leg in Walking Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-robot systems, ensuring safety during force control in the presence of both internal and external disturbances is crucial. As a typical loosely coupled floating-base robot system, the supernumerary robotic leg (SRL) system is particularly susceptible to strong internal disturbances. To address the challenge posed by floating base, we investigated the dynamics model of the loosely coupled SRL and designed a hybrid position/force impedance controller to fit dynamic torque input. An efficient variable impedance control (VIC) method is developed to enhance human-robot interaction, particularly in scenarios involving external force disturbances. By dynamically adjusting impedance parameters, VIC improves the dynamic switching between rigidity and flexibility, so that it can adapt to unknown environmental disturbances in different states. An efficient real-time stability guaranteed impedance parameters generating network is specifically designed for the proposed SRL, to achieve shock mitigation and high rigidity supporting. Simulations and experiments validate the system's effectiveness, demonstrating its ability to maintain smooth signal transitions in flexible states while providing strong support forces in rigid states. This approach provides a practical solution for accommodating individual gait variations in interaction, and significantly advances the safety and adaptability of human-robot systems.</description>

      <title>Innovative Design of Multi-functional Supernumerary Robotic Limbs with Ellipsoid Workspace Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRLs) offer substantial potential in both the rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients and the enhancement of functional capabilities for healthy individuals. Designing a general-purpose SRL device is inherently challenging, particularly when developing a unified theoretical framework that meets the diverse functional requirements of both upper and lower limbs. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective optimization (MOO) design theory that integrates grasping workspace similarity, walking workspace similarity, braced force for sit-to-stand (STS) movements, and overall mass and inertia. A geometric vector quantification method is developed using an ellipsoid to represent the workspace, aiming to reduce computational complexity and address quantification challenges. The ellipsoid envelope transforms workspace points into ellipsoid attributes, providing a parametric description of the workspace. Furthermore, the STS static braced force assesses the effectiveness of force transmission. The overall mass and inertia restricts excessive link length. To facilitate rapid and stable convergence of the model to high-dimensional irregular Pareto fronts, we introduce a multi-subpopulation correction firefly algorithm. This algorithm incorporates a strategy involving attractive and repulsive domains to effectively handle the MOO task. The optimized solution is utilized to redesign the prototype for experimentation to meet specified requirements. Six healthy participants and two hemiplegia patients participated in real experiments. Compared to the pre-optimization results, the average grasp success rate improved by 7.2%, while the muscle activity during walking and STS tasks decreased by an average of 12.7% and 25.1%, respectively. The proposed design theory offers an efficient option for the design of multi-functional SRL mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Locally Optimal Solutions to Constraint Displacement Problems via Path-Obstacle Overlaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified approach for constraint displacement problems in which a robot finds a feasible path by displacing constraints or obstacles. To this end, we propose a two stage process that returns locally optimal obstacle displacements to enable a feasible path for the robot. The first stage proceeds by computing a trajectory through the obstacles while minimizing an appropriate objective function. In the second stage, these obstacles are displaced to make the computed robot trajectory feasible, that is, collision-free. Several examples are provided that successfully demonstrate our approach on two distinct classes of constraint displacement problems.</description>

      <title>SocialNav-Map: Dynamic Mapping with Human Trajectory Prediction for Zero-Shot Social Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12232v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social navigation in densely populated dynamic environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous mobile robots, requiring advanced strategies for safe interaction. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods require over 2000+ hours of extensive training and often struggle to generalize to unfamiliar environments without additional fine-tuning, limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose SocialNav-Map, a novel zero-shot social navigation framework that combines dynamic human trajectory prediction with occupancy mapping, enabling safe and efficient navigation without the need for environment-specific training. Specifically, SocialNav-Map first transforms the task goal position into the constructed map coordinate system. Subsequently, it creates a dynamic occupancy map that incorporates predicted human movements as dynamic obstacles. The framework employs two complementary methods for human trajectory prediction: history prediction and orientation prediction. By integrating these predicted trajectories into the occupancy map, the robot can proactively avoid potential collisions with humans while efficiently navigating to its destination. Extensive experiments on the Social-HM3D and Social-MP3D datasets demonstrate that SocialNav-Map significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) RL-based methods, which require 2,396 GPU hours of training. Notably, it reduces human collision rates by over 10% without necessitating any training in novel environments. By eliminating the need for environment-specific training, SocialNav-Map achieves superior navigation performance, paving the way for the deployment of social navigation systems in real-world environments characterized by diverse human behaviors.

      <title>Intermittent Rendezvous Plans with Mixed Integer Linear Program for Large-Scale Multi-Robot Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Robot Exploration (MRE) systems with communication constraints have proven efficient in accomplishing a variety of tasks, including search-and-rescue, stealth, and military operations. While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability. However, scheduling usually requires knowledge of the environment beforehand, which prevents its deployment in several domains due to related uncertainties (e.g., underwater exploration). In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC.</description>

      <title>SAC-MoE: Reinforcement Learning with Mixture-of-Experts for Control of Hybrid Dynamical Systems with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems result from the interaction of continuous-variable dynamics with discrete events and encompass various systems such as legged robots, vehicles and aircrafts. Challenges arise when the system's modes are characterized by unobservable (latent) parameters and the events that cause system dynamics to switch between different modes are also unobservable. Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization.
  To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments. Our curriculum strategy consistently improves performance across all evaluated policies. Qualitative analysis shows that the interpretable MoE router activates different experts for distinct latent modes.</description>

      <title>Multilaminate piezoelectric PVDF actuators to enhance performance of soft micro robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilayer piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) actuators are a promising approach to enhance performance of soft microrobotic systems. In this work, we develop and characterize multilayer PVDF actuators with parallel voltage distribution across each layer, bridging a unique design space between brittle high-force PZT stacks and compliant but lower-bandwidth soft polymer actuators. We show the effects of layer thickness and number of layers in actuator performance and their agreement with a first principles model. By varying these parameters, we demonstrate actuators capable of &gt;3 mm of free deflection, &gt;20 mN of blocked force, and &gt;=500 Hz, while operating at voltages as low as 150 volts. To illustrate their potential for robotic integration, we integrate our actuators into a planar, translating microrobot that leverages resonance to achieve locomotion with robustness to large perturbations.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning on MetaWorld ML10 Benchmark: Fast Adaptation in Robotic Manipulation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-learning algorithms enable rapid adaptation to new tasks with minimal data, a critical capability for real-world robotic systems. This paper evaluates Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) combined with Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) on the MetaWorld ML10 benchmark, a challenging suite of ten diverse robotic manipulation tasks. We implement and analyze MAML-TRPO's ability to learn a universal initialization that facilitates few-shot adaptation across semantically different manipulation behaviors including pushing, picking, and drawer manipulation. Our experiments demonstrate that MAML achieves effective one-shot adaptation with clear performance improvements after a single gradient update, reaching final success rates of 21.0% on training tasks and 13.2% on held-out test tasks. However, we observe a generalization gap that emerges during meta-training, where performance on test tasks plateaus while training task performance continues to improve. Task-level analysis reveals high variance in adaptation effectiveness, with success rates ranging from 0% to 80% across different manipulation skills. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of gradient-based meta-learning for diverse robotic manipulation, and suggest directions for future work in task-aware adaptation and structured policy architectures.</description>

      <title>Learning Adaptive Neural Teleoperation for Humanoid Robots: From Inverse Kinematics to End-to-End Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) teleoperation has emerged as a promising approach for controlling humanoid robots in complex manipulation tasks. However, traditional teleoperation systems rely on inverse kinematics (IK) solvers and hand-tuned PD controllers, which struggle to handle external forces, adapt to different users, and produce natural motions under dynamic conditions. In this work, we propose a learning-based neural teleoperation framework that replaces the conventional IK+PD pipeline with learned policies trained via reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to directly map VR controller inputs to robot joint commands while implicitly handling force disturbances, producing smooth trajectories, and adapting to user preferences. We train our policies in simulation using demonstrations collected from IK-based teleoperation as initialization, then fine-tune them with force randomization and trajectory smoothness rewards. Experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that our learned policies achieve 34% lower tracking error, 45% smoother motions, and superior force adaptation compared to the IK baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (50Hz control frequency). We validate our approach on manipulation tasks including object pick-and-place, door opening, and bimanual coordination. These results suggest that learning-based approaches can significantly improve the naturalness and robustness of humanoid teleoperation systems.</description>

      <title>RoboAfford++: A Generative AI-Enhanced Dataset for Multimodal Affordance Learning in Robotic Manipulation and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation and navigation are fundamental capabilities of embodied intelligence, enabling effective robot interactions with the physical world. Achieving these capabilities requires a cohesive understanding of the environment, including object recognition to localize target objects, object affordances to identify potential interaction areas and spatial affordances to discern optimal areas for both object placement and robot movement. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level task planning and scene understanding, they often struggle to infer actionable positions for physical interaction, such as functional grasping points and permissible placement regions. This limitation stems from the lack of fine-grained annotations for object and spatial affordances in their training datasets. To tackle this challenge, we introduce RoboAfford++, a generative AI-enhanced dataset for multimodal affordance learning for both robotic manipulation and navigation. Our dataset comprises 869,987 images paired with 2.0 million question answering (QA) annotations, covering three critical tasks: object affordance recognition to identify target objects based on attributes and spatial relationships, object affordance prediction to pinpoint functional parts for manipulation, and spatial affordance localization to identify free space for object placement and robot navigation. Complementing this dataset, we propose RoboAfford-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing affordance-aware prediction in real-world scenarios, featuring 338 meticulously annotated samples across the same three tasks. Extensive experimental results reveal the deficiencies of existing VLMs in affordance learning, while fine-tuning on the RoboAfford++ dataset significantly enhances their ability to reason about object and spatial affordances, validating the dataset's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ClutterNav: Gradient-Guided Search for Efficient 3D Clutter Removal with Learned Costmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense clutter removal for target object retrieval presents a challenging problem, especially when targets are embedded deep within densely-packed configurations. It requires foresight to minimize overall changes to the clutter configuration while accessing target objects, avoiding stack destabilization and reducing the number of object removals required. Rule-based planners when applied to this problem, rely on rigid heuristics, leading to high computational overhead. End-to-end reinforcement learning approaches struggle with interpretability and generalizability over different conditions. To address these issues, we present ClutterNav, a novel decision-making framework that can identify the next best object to be removed so as to access a target object in a given clutter, while minimising stack disturbances. ClutterNav formulates the problem as a continuous reinforcement learning task, where each object removal dynamically updates the understanding of the scene. A removability critic, trained from demonstrations, estimates the cost of removing any given object based on geometric and spatial features. This learned cost is complemented by integrated gradients that assess how the presence or removal of surrounding objects influences the accessibility of the target. By dynamically prioritizing actions that balance immediate removability against long-term target exposure, ClutterNav achieves near human-like strategic sequencing, without predefined heuristics. The proposed approach is validated extensively in simulation and over real-world experiments. The results demonstrate real-time, occlusion-aware decision-making in partially observable environments.</description>

      <title>Botany Meets Robotics in Alpine Scree Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the European Union's Habitat Directive, habitat monitoring plays a critical role in response to the escalating problems posed by biodiversity loss and environmental degradation. Scree habitats, hosting unique and often endangered species, face severe threats from climate change due to their high-altitude nature. Traditionally, their monitoring has required highly skilled scientists to conduct extensive fieldwork in remote, potentially hazardous locations, making the process resource-intensive and time-consuming. This paper presents a novel approach for scree habitat monitoring using a legged robot to assist botanists in data collection and species identification. Specifically, we deployed the ANYmal C robot in the Italian Alpine bio-region in two field campaigns spanning two years and leveraged deep learning to detect and classify key plant species of interest. Our results demonstrate that agile legged robots can navigate challenging terrains and increase the frequency and efficiency of scree monitoring. When paired with traditional phytosociological surveys performed by botanists, this robotics-assisted protocol not only streamlines field operations but also enhances data acquisition, storage, and usage. The outcomes of this research contribute to the evolving landscape of robotics in environmental science, paving the way for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to habitat monitoring and preservation.</description>

      <title>EcoFlight: Finding Low-Energy Paths Through Obstacles for Autonomous Sensing Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstacle avoidance path planning for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, is rarely addressed in most flight path planning schemes, despite obstacles being a realistic condition. Obstacle avoidance can also be energy-intensive, making it a critical factor in efficient point-to-point drone flights. To address these gaps, we propose EcoFlight, an energy-efficient pathfinding algorithm that determines the lowest-energy route in 3D space with obstacles. The algorithm models energy consumption based on the drone propulsion system and flight dynamics. We conduct extensive evaluations, comparing EcoFlight with direct-flight and shortest-distance schemes. The simulation results across various obstacle densities show that EcoFlight consistently finds paths with lower energy consumption than comparable algorithms, particularly in high-density environments. We also demonstrate that a suitable flying speed can further enhance energy savings.</description>

      <title>Task-Aware Morphology Optimization of Planar Manipulators via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, Yoshikawa's manipulability index is used to investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a framework for morphology optimization in planar robotic manipulators. A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure.
  Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Driven Domain Adaptation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving via In-Context RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant progress and advances in autonomous driving, many end-to-end systems still struggle with domain adaptation (DA), such as transferring a policy trained under clear weather to adverse weather conditions. Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines.</description>

      <title>DR. Nav: Semantic-Geometric Representations for Proactive Dead-End Recovery and Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present DR. Nav (Dead-End Recovery-aware Navigation), a novel approach to autonomous navigation in scenarios where dead-end detection and recovery are critical, particularly in unstructured environments where robots must handle corners, vegetation occlusions, and blocked junctions. DR. Nav introduces a proactive strategy for navigation in unmapped environments without prior assumptions. Our method unifies dead-end prediction and recovery by generating a single, continuous, real-time semantic cost map. Specifically, DR. Nav leverages cross-modal RGB-LiDAR fusion with attention-based filtering to estimate per-cell dead-end likelihoods and recovery points, which are continuously updated through Bayesian inference to enhance robustness. Unlike prior mapping methods that only encode traversability, DR. Nav explicitly incorporates recovery-aware risk into the navigation cost map, enabling robots to anticipate unsafe regions and plan safer alternative trajectories. We evaluate DR. Nav across multiple dense indoor and outdoor scenarios and demonstrate an increase of 83.33% in accuracy in detection, a 52.4% reduction in time-to-goal (path efficiency), compared to state-of-the-art planners such as DWA, MPPI, and Nav2 DWB. Furthermore, the dead-end classifier functions</description>

      <title>ActiveGrasp: Information-Guided Active Grasping with Calibrated Energy-based Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grasping in a densely cluttered environment is a challenging task for robots. Previous methods tried to solve this problem by actively gathering multiple views before grasp pose generation. However, they either overlooked the importance of the grasp distribution for information gain estimation or relied on the projection of the grasp distribution, which ignores the structure of grasp poses on the SE(3) manifold. To tackle these challenges, we propose a calibrated energy-based model for grasp pose generation and an active view selection method that estimates information gain from grasp distribution. Our energy-based model captures the multi-modality nature of grasp distribution on the SE(3) manifold. The energy level is calibrated to the success rate of grasps so that the predicted distribution aligns with the real distribution. The next best view is selected by estimating the information gain for grasp from the calibrated distribution conditioned on the reconstructed environment, which could efficiently drive the robot to explore affordable parts of the target object. Experiments on simulated environments and real robot setups demonstrate that our model could successfully grasp objects in a cluttered environment with limited view budgets compared to previous state-of-the-art models. Our simulated environment can serve as a reproducible platform for future research on active grasping. The source code of our paper will be made public when the paper is released to the public.</description>

      <title>Structured Imitation Learning of Interactive Policies through Inverse Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative model-based imitation learning methods have recently achieved strong results in learning high-complexity motor skills from human demonstrations. However, imitation learning of interactive policies that coordinate with humans in shared spaces without explicit communication remains challenging, due to the significantly higher behavioral complexity in multi-agent interactions compared to non-interactive tasks. In this work, we introduce a structured imitation learning framework for interactive policies by combining generative single-agent policy learning with a flexible yet expressive game-theoretic structure. Our method explicitly separates learning into two steps: first, we learn individual behavioral patterns from multi-agent demonstrations using standard imitation learning; then, we structurally learn inter-agent dependencies by solving an inverse game problem. Preliminary results in a synthetic 5-agent social navigation task show that our method significantly improves non-interactive policies and performs comparably to the ground truth interactive policy using only 50 demonstrations. These results highlight the potential of structured imitation learning in interactive settings.</description>

      <title>Towards High-Consistency Embodied World Model with Multi-View Trajectory Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied world models aim to predict and interact with the physical world through visual observations and actions. However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios.</description>

      <title>Air-Chamber Based Soft Six-Axis Force/Torque Sensor for Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft multi-axis force/torque sensors provide safe and precise force interaction. Capturing the complete degree-of-freedom of force is imperative for accurate force measurement with six-axis force/torque sensors. However, cross-axis coupling can lead to calibration issues and decreased accuracy. In this instance, developing a soft and accurate six-axis sensor is a challenging task. In this paper, a soft air-chamber type six-axis force/torque sensor with 16-channel barometers is introduced, which housed in hyper-elastic air chambers made of silicone rubber. Additionally, an effective decoupling method is proposed, based on a rigid-soft hierarchical structure, which reduces the six-axis decoupling problem to two three-axis decoupling problems. Finite element model simulation and experiments demonstrate the compatibility of the proposed approach with reality. The prototype's sensing performance is quantitatively measured in terms of static load response, dynamic load response and dynamic response characteristic. It possesses a measuring range of 50 N force and 1 Nm torque, and the average deviation, repeatability, non-linearity and hysteresis are 4.9$\%$, 2.7$\%$, 5.8$\%$ and 6.7$\%$, respectively. The results indicate that the prototype exhibits satisfactory sensing performance while maintaining its softness due to the presence of soft air chambers.</description>

      <title>TOPP-DWR: Time-Optimal Path Parameterization of Differential-Driven Wheeled Robots Considering Piecewise-Constant Angular Velocity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential-driven wheeled robots (DWR) represent the quintessential type of mobile robots and find extensive appli- cations across the robotic field. Most high-performance control approaches for DWR explicitly utilize the linear and angular velocities of the trajectory as control references. However, existing research on time-optimal path parameterization (TOPP) for mobile robots usually neglects the angular velocity and joint vel- ocity constraints, which can result in degraded control perfor- mance in practical applications. In this article, a systematic and practical TOPP algorithm named TOPP-DWR is proposed for DWR and other mobile robots. First, the non-uniform B-spline is adopted to represent the initial trajectory in the task space. Second, the piecewise-constant angular velocity, as well as joint velocity, linear velocity, and linear acceleration constraints, are incorporated into the TOPP problem. During the construction of the optimization problem, the aforementioned constraints are uniformly represented as linear velocity constraints. To boost the numerical computational efficiency, we introduce a slack variable to reformulate the problem into second-order-cone programming (SOCP). Subsequently, comparative experiments are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that TOPP-DWR achieves TOPP while adhering to all constraints. Finally, field autonomous navigation experiments are carried out to validate the practicability of TOPP-DWR in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>DiffuDepGrasp: Diffusion-based Depth Noise Modeling Empowers Sim2Real Robotic Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transferring the depth-based end-to-end policy trained in simulation to physical robots can yield an efficient and robust grasping policy, yet sensor artifacts in real depth maps like voids and noise establish a significant sim2real gap that critically impedes policy transfer. Training-time strategies like procedural noise injection or learned mappings suffer from data inefficiency due to unrealistic noise simulation, which is often ineffective for grasping tasks that require fine manipulation or dependency on paired datasets heavily. Furthermore, leveraging foundation models to reduce the sim2real gap via intermediate representations fails to mitigate the domain shift fully and adds computational overhead during deployment. This work confronts dual challenges of data inefficiency and deployment complexity. We propose DiffuDepGrasp, a deploy-efficient sim2real framework enabling zero-shot transfer through simulation-exclusive policy training. Its core innovation, the Diffusion Depth Generator, synthesizes geometrically pristine simulation depth with learned sensor-realistic noise via two synergistic modules. The first Diffusion Depth Module leverages temporal geometric priors to enable sample-efficient training of a conditional diffusion model that captures complex sensor noise distributions, while the second Noise Grafting Module preserves metric accuracy during perceptual artifact injection. With only raw depth inputs during deployment, DiffuDepGrasp eliminates computational overhead and achieves a 95.7% average success rate on 12-object grasping with zero-shot transfer and strong generalization to unseen objects.Project website: https://diffudepgrasp.github.io/.</description>

      <title>GUIDE: Gaussian Unified Instance Detection for Enhanced Obstacle Perception in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of autonomous driving, accurately detecting surrounding obstacles is crucial for effective decision-making. Traditional methods primarily rely on 3D bounding boxes to represent these obstacles, which often fail to capture the complexity of irregularly shaped, real-world objects. To overcome these limitations, we present GUIDE, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussians for instance detection and occupancy prediction. Unlike conventional occupancy prediction methods, GUIDE also offers robust tracking capabilities. Our framework employs a sparse representation strategy, using Gaussian-to-Voxel Splatting to provide fine-grained, instance-level occupancy data without the computational demands associated with dense voxel grids. Experimental validation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates GUIDE's performance, with an instance occupancy mAP of 21.61, marking a 50\% improvement over existing methods, alongside competitive tracking capabilities. GUIDE establishes a new benchmark in autonomous perception systems, effectively combining precision with computational efficiency to better address the complexities of real-world driving environments.</description>

      <title>SplatSearch: Instance Image Goal Navigation for Mobile Robots using 3D Gaussian Splatting and Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Instance Image Goal Navigation (IIN) problem requires mobile robots deployed in unknown environments to search for specific objects or people of interest using only a single reference goal image of the target. This problem can be especially challenging when: 1) the reference image is captured from an arbitrary viewpoint, and 2) the robot must operate with sparse-view scene reconstructions. In this paper, we address the IIN problem, by introducing SplatSearch, a novel architecture that leverages sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. SplatSearch renders multiple viewpoints around candidate objects using a sparse online 3DGS map, and uses a multi-view diffusion model to complete missing regions of the rendered images, enabling robust feature matching against the goal image. A novel frontier exploration policy is introduced which uses visual context from the synthesized viewpoints with semantic context from the goal image to evaluate frontier locations, allowing the robot to prioritize frontiers that are semantically and visually relevant to the goal image. Extensive experiments in photorealistic home and real-world environments validate the higher performance of SplatSearch against current state-of-the-art methods in terms of Success Rate and Success Path Length. An ablation study confirms the design choices of SplatSearch.</description>

      <title>CUTE-Planner: Confidence-aware Uneven Terrain Exploration Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary exploration robots must navigate uneven terrain while building reliable maps for space missions. However, most existing methods incorporate traversability constraints but may not handle high uncertainty in elevation estimates near complex features like craters, do not consider exploration strategies for uncertainty reduction, and typically fail to address how elevation uncertainty affects navigation safety and map quality. To address the problems, we propose a framework integrating safe path generation, adaptive confidence updates, and confidence-aware exploration strategies. Using Kalman-based elevation estimation, our approach generates terrain traversability and confidence scores, then incorporates them into Graph-Based exploration Planner (GBP) to prioritize exploration of traversable low-confidence regions. We evaluate our framework through simulated lunar experiments using a novel low-confidence region ratio metric, achieving 69% uncertainty reduction compared to baseline GBP. In terms of mission success rate, our method achieves 100% while baseline GBP achieves 0%, demonstrating improvements in exploration safety and map reliability.</description>

      <title>APP: A* Post-Processing Algorithm for Robots with Bidirectional Shortcut and Path Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paths generated by A* and other graph-search-based planners are widely used in the robotic field. Due to the restricted node-expansion directions, the resulting paths are usually not the shortest. Besides, unnecessary heading changes, or zig-zag patterns, exist even when no obstacle is nearby, which is inconsistent with the human intuition that the path segments should be straight in wide-open space due to the absence of obstacles. This article puts forward a general and systematic post-processing algorithm for A* and other graph-search-based planners. The A* post-processing algorithm, called APP, is developed based on the costmap, which is widely used in commercial service robots. First, a bidirectional vertices reduction algorithm is proposed to tackle the asymm- etry of the path and the environments. During the forward and backward vertices reduction, a thorough shortcut strategy is put forward to improve the path-shortening performance and avoid unnecessary heading changes. Second, an iterative path perturbation algorithm is adopted to locally reduce the number of unnecessary heading changes and improve the path smooth- ness. Comparative experiments are then carried out to validate the superiority of the proposed method. Quantitative performance indexes show that APP outperforms the existing methods in planning time, path length as well as the number of unnecessary heading changes. Finally, field navigation experiments are carried out to verify the practicability of APP.</description>

Abstract: Practical global path planning is critical for commercializing cleaning robots working in semi-structured environments. In the literature, global path planning methods for free space usually focus on path length and neglect the traffic rule constraints of the environments, which leads to high-frequency re-planning and increases collision risks. In contrast, those for structured environments are developed mainly by strictly complying with the road network representing the traffic rule constraints, which may result in an overlong path that hinders the overall navigation efficiency. This article proposes a general and systematic approach to improve global path planning performance in semi-structured environments. A unidirectional road network is built to represent the traffic constraints in semi-structured environments and a hybrid strategy is proposed to achieve a guaranteed planning result.Cutting across the road at the starting and the goal points are allowed to achieve a shorter path. Especially, a two-layer potential map is proposed to achieve a guaranteed performance when the starting and the goal points are in complex intersections. Comparative experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Quantitative experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-art, the proposed method guarantees a much better balance between path length and the consistency with the road network.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Free Neural Network-Based Bias Estimation for Low-Cost Stationary Accelerometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-cost micro-electromechanical accelerometers are widely used in navigation, robotics, and consumer devices for motion sensing and position estimation. However, their performance is often degraded by bias errors. To eliminate deterministic bias terms a calibration procedure is applied under stationary conditions. It requires accelerom- eter leveling or complex orientation-dependent calibration procedures. To overcome those requirements, in this paper we present a model-free learning-based calibration method that estimates accelerometer bias under stationary conditions, without requiring knowledge of the sensor orientation and without the need to rotate the sensors. The proposed approach provides a fast, practical, and scalable solution suitable for rapid field deployment. Experimental validation on a 13.39-hour dataset collected from six accelerometers shows that the proposed method consistently achieves error levels more than 52% lower than traditional techniques. On a broader scale, this work contributes to the advancement of accurate calibration methods in orientation-free scenarios. As a consequence, it improves the reliability of low-cost inertial sensors in diverse scientific and industrial applications and eliminates the need for leveled calibration.</description>

      <title>ResAlignNet: A Data-Driven Approach for INS/DVL Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles rely on precise navigation systems that combine the inertial navigation system and the Doppler velocity log for successful missions in challenging environments where satellite navigation is unavailable. The effectiveness of this integration critically depends on accurate alignment between the sensor reference frames. Standard model-based alignment methods between these sensor systems suffer from lengthy convergence times, dependence on prescribed motion patterns, and reliance on external aiding sensors, significantly limiting operational flexibility. To address these limitations, this paper presents ResAlignNet, a data-driven approach using the 1D ResNet-18 architecture that transforms the alignment problem into deep neural network optimization, operating as an in-situ solution that requires only sensors on board without external positioning aids or complex vehicle maneuvers, while achieving rapid convergence in seconds. Additionally, the approach demonstrates the learning capabilities of Sim2Real transfer, enabling training in synthetic data while deploying in operational sensor measurements. Experimental validation using the Snapir autonomous underwater vehicle demonstrates that ResAlignNet achieves alignment accuracy within 0.8{\deg} using only 25 seconds of data collection, representing a 65\% reduction in convergence time compared to standard velocity-based methods. The trajectory-independent solution eliminates motion pattern requirements and enables immediate vehicle deployment without lengthy pre-mission procedures, advancing underwater navigation capabilities through robust sensor-agnostic alignment that scales across different operational scenarios and sensor specifications.</description>

      <title>Count Every Rotation and Every Rotation Counts: Exploring Drone Dynamics via Propeller Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As drone-based applications proliferate, paramount contactless sensing of airborne drones from the ground becomes indispensable. This work demonstrates concentrating on propeller rotational speed will substantially improve drone sensing performance and proposes an event-camera-based solution, \sysname. \sysname features two components: \textit{Count Every Rotation} achieves accurate, real-time propeller speed estimation by mitigating ultra-high sensitivity of event cameras to environmental noise. \textit{Every Rotation Counts} leverages these speeds to infer both internal and external drone dynamics. Extensive evaluations in real-world drone delivery scenarios show that \sysname achieves a sensing latency of 3$ms$ and a rotational speed estimation error of merely 0.23\%. Additionally, \sysname infers drone flight commands with 96.5\% precision and improves drone tracking accuracy by over 22\% when combined with other sensing modalities. \textit{ Demo: {\color{blue}https://eventpro25.github.io/EventPro/.} }</description>

      <title>Monolithic Units: Actuation, Sensing, and Simulation for Integrated Soft Robot Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces the Monolithic Unit (MU), an actuator-lattice-sensor building block for soft robotics. The MU integrates pneumatic actuation, a compliant lattice envelope, and candidate sites for optical waveguide sensing into a single printed body. In order to study reproducibility and scalability, a parametric design framework establishes deterministic rules linking actuator chamber dimensions to lattice unit cell size. Experimental homogenization of lattice specimens provides effective material properties for finite element simulation. Within this simulation environment, sensor placement is treated as a discrete optimization problem, where a finite set of candidate waveguide paths derived from lattice nodes is evaluated by introducing local stiffening, and the configuration minimizing deviation from baseline mechanical response is selected. Optimized models are fabricated and experimentally characterized, validating the preservation of mechanical performance while enabling embedded sensing. The workflow is further extended to scaled units and a two-finger gripper, demonstrating generality of the MU concept. This approach advances monolithic soft robotic design by combining reproducible co-design rules with simulation-informed sensor integration.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Navigation of Mobile Robots via Quadtree-Based Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an integrated navigation framework for Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) that unifies environment representation, trajectory generation, and Model Predictive Control (MPC). The proposed approach incorporates a quadtree-based method to generate structured, axis-aligned collision-free regions from occupancy maps. These regions serve as both a basis for developing safe corridors and as linear constraints within the MPC formulation, enabling efficient and reliable navigation without requiring direct obstacle encoding. The complete pipeline combines safe-area extraction, connectivity graph construction, trajectory generation, and B-spline smoothing into one coherent system. Experimental results demonstrate consistent success and superior performance compared to baseline approaches across complex environments.</description>

      <title>PIGEON: VLM-Driven Object Navigation via Points of Interest Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating to a specified object in an unknown environment is a fundamental yet challenging capability of embodied intelligence. However, current methods struggle to balance decision frequency with intelligence, resulting in decisions lacking foresight or discontinuous actions. In this work, we propose PIGEON: Point of Interest Guided Exploration for Object Navigation with VLM, maintaining a lightweight and semantically aligned snapshot memory during exploration as semantic input for the exploration strategy. We use a large Visual-Language Model (VLM), named PIGEON-VL, to select Points of Interest (PoI) formed during exploration and then employ a lower-level planner for action output, increasing the decision frequency. Additionally, this PoI-based decision-making enables the generation of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) data suitable for simulators. Experiments on classic object navigation benchmarks demonstrate that our zero-shot transfer method achieves state-of-the-art performance, while RLVR further enhances the model's semantic guidance capabilities, enabling deep reasoning during real-time navigation.</description>

      <title>GaRLILEO: Gravity-aligned Radar-Leg-Inertial Enhanced Odometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of legged robots for navigating challenging terrains (e.g., stairs, slopes, and unstructured environments) has gained increasing preference over wheel-based platforms. In such scenarios, accurate odometry estimation is a preliminary requirement for stable locomotion, localization, and mapping. Traditional proprioceptive approaches, which rely on leg kinematics sensor modalities and inertial sensing, suffer from irrepressible vertical drift caused by frequent contact impacts, foot slippage, and vibrations, particularly affected by inaccurate roll and pitch estimation. Existing methods incorporate exteroceptive sensors such as LiDAR or cameras. Further enhancement has been introduced by leveraging gravity vector estimation to add additional observations on roll and pitch, thereby increasing the accuracy of vertical pose estimation. However, these approaches tend to degrade in feature-sparse or repetitive scenes and are prone to errors from double-integrated IMU acceleration. To address these challenges, we propose GaRLILEO, a novel gravity-aligned continuous-time radar-leg-inertial odometry framework. GaRLILEO decouples velocity from the IMU by building a continuous-time ego-velocity spline from SoC radar Doppler and leg kinematics information, enabling seamless sensor fusion which mitigates odometry distortion. In addition, GaRLILEO can reliably capture accurate gravity vectors leveraging a novel soft S2-constrained gravity factor, improving vertical pose accuracy without relying on LiDAR or cameras. Evaluated on a self-collected real-world dataset with diverse indoor-outdoor trajectories, GaRLILEO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly in vertical odometry estimation on stairs and slopes. We open-source both our dataset and algorithm to foster further research in legged robot odometry and SLAM. https://garlileo.github.io/GaRLILEO</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acting in human environments is a crucial capability for general-purpose robots, necessitating a robust understanding of natural language and its application to physical tasks. This paper seeks to harness the capabilities of diffusion models within a visuomotor policy framework that merges visual and textual inputs to generate precise robotic trajectories. By employing reference demonstrations during training, the model learns to execute manipulation tasks specified through textual commands within the robot's immediate environment. The proposed research aims to extend an existing model by leveraging improved embeddings, and adapting techniques from diffusion models for image generation. We evaluate our methods on the CALVIN dataset, proving enhanced performance on various manipulation tasks and an increased long-horizon success rate when multiple tasks are executed in sequence. Our approach reinforces the usefulness of diffusion models and contributes towards general multitask manipulation.</description>

      <title>ZeroDexGrasp: Zero-Shot Task-Oriented Dexterous Grasp Synthesis with Prompt-Based Multi-Stage Semantic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented dexterous grasping holds broad application prospects in robotic manipulation and human-object interaction. However, most existing methods still struggle to generalize across diverse objects and task instructions, as they heavily rely on costly labeled data to ensure task-specific semantic alignment. In this study, we propose \textbf{ZeroDexGrasp}, a zero-shot task-oriented dexterous grasp synthesis framework integrating Multimodal Large Language Models with grasp refinement to generate human-like grasp poses that are well aligned with specific task objectives and object affordances. Specifically, ZeroDexGrasp employs prompt-based multi-stage semantic reasoning to infer initial grasp configurations and object contact information from task and object semantics, then exploits contact-guided grasp optimization to refine these poses for physical feasibility and task alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that ZeroDexGrasp enables high-quality zero-shot dexterous grasping on diverse unseen object categories and complex task requirements, advancing toward more generalizable and intelligent robotic grasping.</description>

      <title>Contact-Safe Reinforcement Learning with ProMP Reparameterization and Energy Awareness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are predominantly applied in the robot joint space, often relying on limited task-specific information and partial awareness of the 3D environment. In contrast, episodic RL has demonstrated advantages over traditional MDP-based methods in terms of trajectory consistency, task awareness, and overall performance in complex robotic tasks. Moreover, traditional step-wise and episodic RL methods often neglect the contact-rich information inherent in task-space manipulation, especially considering the contact-safety and robustness. In this work, contact-rich manipulation tasks are tackled using a task-space, energy-safe framework, where reliable and safe task-space trajectories are generated through the combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and movement primitives. Furthermore, an energy-aware Cartesian Impedance Controller objective is incorporated within the proposed framework to ensure safe interactions between the robot and the environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in handling tasks on various types of surfaces in 3D environments, achieving high success rates as well as smooth trajectories and energy-safe interactions.</description>

      <title>Towards Affect-Adaptive Human-Robot Interaction: A Protocol for Multimodal Dataset Collection on Social Anxiety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social anxiety is a prevalent condition that affects interpersonal interactions and social functioning. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and social robotics offer new opportunities to examine social anxiety in the human-robot interaction context. Accurate detection of affective states and behaviours associated with social anxiety requires multimodal datasets, where each signal modality provides complementary insights into its manifestations. However, such datasets remain scarce, limiting progress in both research and applications. To address this, this paper presents a protocol for multimodal dataset collection designed to reflect social anxiety in a human-robot interaction context. The dataset will consist of synchronised audio, video, and physiological recordings acquired from at least 70 participants, grouped according to their level of social anxiety, as they engage in approximately 10-minute interactive Wizard-of-Oz role-play scenarios with the Furhat social robot under controlled experimental conditions. In addition to multimodal data, the dataset will be enriched with contextual data providing deeper insight into individual variability in social anxiety responses. This work can contribute to research on affect-adaptive human-robot interaction by providing support for robust multimodal detection of social anxiety.</description>

      <title>OpenRoboCare: A Multimodal Multi-Task Expert Demonstration Dataset for Robot Caregiving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present OpenRoboCare, a multimodal dataset for robot caregiving, capturing expert occupational therapist demonstrations of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Caregiving tasks involve complex physical human-robot interactions, requiring precise perception under occlusions, safe physical contact, and long-horizon planning. While recent advances in robot learning from demonstrations have shown promise, there is a lack of a large-scale, diverse, and expert-driven dataset that captures real-world caregiving routines. To address this gap, we collect data from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 ADL tasks on two manikins. The dataset spans five modalities: RGB-D video, pose tracking, eye-gaze tracking, task and action annotations, and tactile sensing, providing rich multimodal insights into caregiver movement, attention, force application, and task execution strategies. We further analyze expert caregiving principles and strategies, offering insights to improve robot efficiency and task feasibility. Additionally, our evaluations demonstrate that OpenRoboCare presents challenges for state-of-the-art robot perception and human activity recognition methods, both critical for developing safe and adaptive assistive robots, highlighting the value of our contribution.

      <title>From Power to Precision: Learning Fine-grained Dexterity for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand design: the difficulty of achieving both stable power grasps and precise, fine-grained manipulation within a single, versatile system. In this work, we bridge this gap by jointly optimizing the control and hardware design of a multi-fingered dexterous hand, enabling both power and precision manipulation. Rather than redesigning the entire hand, we introduce a lightweight fingertip geometry modification, represent it as a contact plane, and jointly optimize its parameters along with the corresponding control. Our control strategy dynamically switches between power and precision manipulation and simplifies precision control into parallel thumb-index motions, which proves robust for sim-to-real transfer. On the design side, we leverage large-scale simulation to optimize the fingertip geometry using a differentiable neural-physics surrogate model. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both sim-to-real and real-to-real settings. Our method achieves an 82.5% zero-shot success rate on unseen objects in sim-to-real precision grasping, and a 93.3% success rate in challenging real-world tasks involving bread pinching. These results demonstrate that our co-design framework can significantly enhance the fine-grained manipulation ability of multi-fingered hands without reducing their ability for power grasps.

      <title>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in 3D Environments through Semantic Segmentation: A Case Study in ViZDoom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in 3D environments with high-dimensional sensory input poses two major challenges: (1) the high memory consumption induced by memory buffers required to stabilise learning, and (2) the complexity of learning in partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). This project addresses these challenges by proposing two novel input representations: SS-only and RGB+SS, both employing semantic segmentation on RGB colour images. Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided. Furthermore, we explored density-based heatmapping as a tool to visualise RL agents' movement patterns and evaluate their suitability for data collection.

      <title>Target Defense against Sequentially Arriving Intruders: Algorithm for Agents with Dubins Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. Both the defender and the intruders have non-holonomic dynamics. The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte-Carlo-type random trials of experiments.</description>

      <title>Density-Driven Multi-Agent Coordination for Efficient Farm Coverage and Management in Smart Agriculture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing scale of modern farms has increased the need for efficient and adaptive multi-agent coverage strategies for pest, weed, and disease management. Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination.
  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture.</description>

      <title>OPFormer: Object Pose Estimation leveraging foundation model with geometric encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates object detection and pose estimation with a versatile onboarding process. Our pipeline begins with an onboarding stage that generates object representations from either traditional 3D CAD models or, in their absence, by rapidly reconstructing a high-fidelity neural representation (NeRF) from multi-view images. Given a test image, our system first employs the CNOS detector to localize target objects. For each detection, our novel pose estimation module, OPFormer, infers the precise 6D pose. The core of OPFormer is a transformer-based architecture that leverages a foundation model for robust feature extraction. It uniquely learns a comprehensive object representation by jointly encoding multiple template views and enriches these features with explicit 3D geometric priors using Normalized Object Coordinate Space (NOCS). A decoder then establishes robust 2D-3D correspondences to determine the final pose. Evaluated on the challenging BOP benchmarks, our integrated system demonstrates a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency, showcasing its practical applicability in both model-based and model-free scenarios.</description>

      <title>Are LLMs The Way Forward? A Case Study on LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (&lt; 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.</description>

      <title>Density-Driven Optimal Control for Non-Uniform Area Coverage in Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems Using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental problem of non-uniform area coverage in multi-agent systems, where different regions require varying levels of attention due to mission-dependent priorities. Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution.
  To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information.
  Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability.</description>

      <title>Uni-Hand: Universal Hand Motion Forecasting in Egocentric Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12878v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting how human hands move in egocentric views is critical for applications like augmented reality and human-robot policy transfer. Recently, several hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods have been developed to generate future possible hand waypoints, which still suffer from insufficient prediction targets, inherent modality gaps, entangled hand-head motion, and limited validation in downstream tasks. To address these limitations, we present a universal hand motion forecasting framework considering multi-modal input, multi-dimensional and multi-target prediction patterns, and multi-task affordances for downstream applications. We harmonize multiple modalities by vision-language fusion, global context incorporation, and task-aware text embedding injection, to forecast hand waypoints in both 2D and 3D spaces. A novel dual-branch diffusion is proposed to concurrently predict human head and hand movements, capturing their motion synergy in egocentric vision. By introducing target indicators, the prediction model can forecast the specific joint waypoints of the wrist or the fingers, besides the widely studied hand center points. In addition, we enable Uni-Hand to additionally predict hand-object interaction states (contact/separation) to facilitate downstream tasks better. As the first work to incorporate downstream task evaluation in the literature, we build novel benchmarks to assess the real-world applicability of hand motion forecasting algorithms. The experimental results on multiple publicly available datasets and our newly proposed benchmarks demonstrate that Uni-Hand achieves the state-of-the-art performance in multi-dimensional and multi-target hand motion forecasting. Extensive validation in multiple downstream tasks also presents its impressive human-robot policy transfer to enable robotic manipulation, and effective feature enhancement for action anticipation/recognition.</description>

      <title>DiffPixelFormer: Differential Pixel-Aware Transformer for RGB-D Indoor Scene Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor semantic segmentation is fundamental to computer vision and robotics, supporting applications such as autonomous navigation, augmented reality, and smart environments. Although RGB-D fusion leverages complementary appearance and geometric cues, existing methods often depend on computationally intensive cross-attention mechanisms and insufficiently model intra- and inter-modal feature relationships, resulting in imprecise feature alignment and limited discriminative representation. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPixelFormer, a differential pixel-aware Transformer for RGB-D indoor scene segmentation that simultaneously enhances intra-modal representations and models inter-modal interactions. At its core, the Intra-Inter Modal Interaction Block (IIMIB) captures intra-modal long-range dependencies via self-attention and models inter-modal interactions with the Differential-Shared Inter-Modal (DSIM) module to disentangle modality-specific and shared cues, enabling fine-grained, pixel-level cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, a dynamic fusion strategy balances modality contributions and fully exploits RGB-D information according to scene characteristics. Extensive experiments on the SUN RGB-D and NYUDv2 benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPixelFormer-L achieves mIoU scores of 54.28% and 59.95%, outperforming DFormer-L by 1.78% and 2.75%, respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2511.13245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This EPTCS volume contains the papers from the Seventh International Workshop on Formal Methods for Autonomous Systems (FMAS 2025), which was held between the 17th and 19th of November 2025. The goal of the FMAS workshop series is to bring together leading researchers who are using formal methods to tackle the unique challenges that autonomous systems present, so that they can publish and discuss their work with a growing community of researchers. FMAS 2025 was co-located with the 20th International Conference on integrated Formal Methods (iFM'25), hosted by Inria Paris, France at the Inria Paris Center. 
  In total, FMAS 2025 received 16 submissions from researchers at institutions in: Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. Though we received fewer submissions than last year, we are encouraged to see the submissions being sent from a wide range of countries. Submissions come from both past and new FMAS authors, which shows us that the existing community appreciates the network that FMAS has built over the past 7 years, while new authors also show the FMAS community's great potential of growth.</description>

      <title>PhysX-Anything: Simulation-Ready Physical 3D Assets from Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D modeling is shifting from static visual representations toward physical, articulated assets that can be directly used in simulation and interaction. However, most existing 3D generation methods overlook key physical and articulation properties, thereby limiting their utility in embodied AI. To bridge this gap, we introduce PhysX-Anything, the first simulation-ready physical 3D generative framework that, given a single in-the-wild image, produces high-quality sim-ready 3D assets with explicit geometry, articulation, and physical attributes. Specifically, we propose the first VLM-based physical 3D generative model, along with a new 3D representation that efficiently tokenizes geometry. It reduces the number of tokens by 193x, enabling explicit geometry learning within standard VLM token budgets without introducing any special tokens during fine-tuning and significantly improving generative quality. In addition, to overcome the limited diversity of existing physical 3D datasets, we construct a new dataset, PhysX-Mobility, which expands the object categories in prior physical 3D datasets by over 2x and includes more than 2K common real-world objects with rich physical annotations. Extensive experiments on PhysX-Mobility and in-the-wild images demonstrate that PhysX-Anything delivers strong generative performance and robust generalization. Furthermore, simulation-based experiments in a MuJoCo-style environment validate that our sim-ready assets can be directly used for contact-rich robotic policy learning. We believe PhysX-Anything can substantially empower a broad range of downstream applications, especially in embodied AI and physics-based simulation.</description>

      <title>Scaling Spatial Intelligence with Multimodal Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress, multimodal foundation models still exhibit surprising deficiencies in spatial intelligence. In this work, we explore scaling up multimodal foundation models to cultivate spatial intelligence within the SenseNova-SI family, built upon established multimodal foundations including visual understanding models (i.e., Qwen3-VL and InternVL3) and unified understanding and generation models (i.e., Bagel). We take a principled approach to constructing high-performing and robust spatial intelligence by systematically curating SenseNova-SI-8M: eight million diverse data samples under a rigorous taxonomy of spatial capabilities. SenseNova-SI demonstrates unprecedented performance across a broad range of spatial intelligence benchmarks: 68.7% on VSI-Bench, 43.3% on MMSI, 85.6% on MindCube, 54.6% on ViewSpatial, and 50.1% on SITE, while maintaining strong general multimodal understanding (e.g., 84.9% on MMBench-En). More importantly, we analyze the impact of data scaling, discuss early signs of emergent generalization capabilities enabled by diverse data training, analyze the risk of overfitting and language shortcuts, present a preliminary study on spatial chain-of-thought reasoning, and validate the potential downstream application. SenseNova-SI is an ongoing project, and this report will be updated continuously. All newly trained multimodal foundation models are publicly released to facilitate further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Large-Scale Multi-Robot Assembly Planning for Autonomous Manufacturing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile autonomous robots have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes. However, employing large robot fleets in manufacturing requires addressing challenges including collision-free movement in a shared workspace, effective multi-robot collaboration to manipulate and transport large payloads, complex task allocation due to coupled manufacturing processes, and spatial planning for parallel assembly and transportation of nested subassemblies. We propose a full algorithmic stack for large-scale multi-robot assembly planning that addresses these challenges and can synthesize construction plans for complex assemblies with thousands of parts in a matter of minutes. Our approach takes in a CAD-like product specification and automatically plans a full-stack assembly procedure for a group of robots to manufacture the product. We propose an algorithmic stack that comprises: (i) an iterative radial layout optimization procedure to define a global staging layout for the manufacturing facility, (ii) a graph-repair mixed-integer program formulation and a modified greedy task allocation algorithm to optimally allocate robots and robot sub-teams to assembly and transport tasks, (iii) a geometric heuristic and a hill-climbing algorithm to plan collaborative carrying configurations of robot sub-teams, and (iv) a distributed control policy that enables robots to execute the assembly motion plan collision-free. We also present an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator implemented in Julia as a resource to the research community, to test our algorithms and to facilitate multi-robot manufacturing research more broadly. Our empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach by generating plans to manufacture a LEGO model of a Saturn V launch vehicle with 1845 parts, 306 subassemblies, and 250 robots in under three minutes on a standard laptop computer.</description>

      <title>LLM-Driven Robots Risk Enacting Discrimination, Violence, and Unlawful Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Members of the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Machine Learning (ML) communities have proposed Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising resource for robotics tasks such as natural language interaction, household and workplace tasks, approximating 'common sense reasoning', and modeling humans. However, recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real-world robot experiments and applications. To assess whether such concerns are well placed in the context of HRI, we evaluate several highly-rated LLMs on discrimination and safety criteria. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs are currently unsafe for people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics, including, but not limited to, race, gender, disability status, nationality, religion, and their intersections. Concretely, we show that LLMs produce directly discriminatory outcomes- e.g., 'gypsy' and 'mute' people are labeled untrustworthy, but not 'european' or 'able-bodied' people. We find various such examples of direct discrimination on HRI tasks such as facial expression, proxemics, security, rescue, and task assignment. Furthermore, we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs, and find they fail to act safely, generating responses that accept dangerous, violent, or unlawful instructions-such as incident-causing misstatements, taking people's mobility aids, and sexual predation. Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic, routine, and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe, effective, and just to do so. We provide code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/rumaisa-azeem/llm-robots-discrimination-safety .</description>

      <title>A Cooperation Control Framework Based on Admittance Control and Time-varying Passive Velocity Field Control for Human-Robot Co-carrying Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human-robot co-carrying tasks reveal their potential in both industrial and everyday applications by leveraging the strengths of both parties. Effective control of robots in these tasks requires managing the energy level in the closed-loop systems to prevent potential dangers while also minimizing motion errors to complete the shared tasks. The collaborative tasks pose numerous challenges due to varied human intentions in adapting to workspace characteristics, leading to human-robot conflicts. In this paper, we develop a cooperation control framework for human-robot co-carrying tasks constructed by utilizing reference generator and low-level controller to aim to achieve safe interaction and synchronized human-robot movement. Firstly, the human motion predictions are corrected in the event of prediction errors based on the conflicts measured by the interaction forces through admittance control, thereby mitigating conflict levels. Low-level controller using an energy-compensation passive velocity field control approach allows encoding the corrected motion to produce control torques for the robot. In this manner, the closed-loop robotic system is passive when the energy level exceeds the predetermined threshold, and otherwise. Furthermore, the proposed control approach ensures that the system's kinetic energy is compensated within a finite time interval. The passivity, stability, convergence rate of energy, and power flow regulation are analyzed from theoretical viewpoints. Human-in-the-loop experiments involving 18 participants have demonstrated that the proposed method significantly enhances task performance and reduces human workload, as evidenced by both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, with improvements confirmed by statistical tests (p &lt; 0.05) relative to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>A Skeleton-Based Topological Planner for Exploration in Complex Unknown Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capability of autonomous exploration in complex, unknown environments is important in many robotic applications. While recent research on autonomous exploration have achieved much progress, there are still limitations, e.g., existing methods relying on greedy heuristics or optimal path planning are often hindered by repetitive paths and high computational demands. To address such limitations, we propose a novel exploration framework that utilizes the global topology information of observed environment to improve exploration efficiency while reducing computational overhead. Specifically, global information is utilized based on a skeletal topological graph representation of the environment geometry. We first propose an incremental skeleton extraction method based on wavefront propagation, based on which we then design an approach to generate a lightweight topological graph that can effectively capture the environment's structural characteristics. Building upon this, we introduce a finite state machine that leverages the topological structure to efficiently plan coverage paths, which can substantially mitigate the back-and-forth maneuvers (BFMs) problem. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/Haochen-Niu/STGPlanner.</description>

      <title>EnerVerse: Envisioning Embodied Future Space for Robotics Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EnerVerse, a generative robotics foundation model that constructs and interprets embodied spaces. EnerVerse employs a chunk-wise autoregressive video diffusion framework to predict future embodied spaces from instructions, enhanced by a sparse context memory for long-term reasoning. To model the 3D robotics world, we adopt a multi-view video representation, providing rich perspectives to address challenges like motion ambiguity and 3D grounding. Additionally, EnerVerse-D, a data engine pipeline combining generative modeling with 4D Gaussian Splatting, forms a self-reinforcing data loop to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Leveraging these innovations, EnerVerse translates 4D world representations into physical actions via a policy head (EnerVerse-A), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. For efficiency, EnerVerse-A reuses features from the first denoising step and predicts action chunks, achieving about 280 ms per 8-step action chunk on a single RTX 4090. Further video demos, dataset samples could be found in our project page.</description>

      <title>PB-NBV: Efficient Projection-Based Next-Best-View Planning Framework for Reconstruction of Unknown Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Completely capturing the three-dimensional (3D) data of an object is essential in industrial and robotic applications. The task of next-best-view (NBV) planning is to calculate the next optimal viewpoint based on the current data, gradually achieving a complete 3D reconstruction of the object. However, many existing NBV planning algorithms incur heavy computational costs due to the extensive use of ray-casting. Specifically, this framework refits different types of voxel clusters into ellipsoids based on the voxel structure. Then, the next optimal viewpoint is selected from the candidate views using a projection-based viewpoint quality evaluation function in conjunction with a global partitioning strategy. This process replaces extensive ray-casting, significantly improving the computational efficiency. Comparison experiments in the simulation environment show that our framework achieves the highest point cloud coverage with low computational time compared to other frameworks. The real-world experiments also confirm the efficiency and feasibility of the framework. Our method will be made open source to benefit the community.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Risk Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles from Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Occupancy Heatmaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately assessing collision risk in dynamic traffic scenarios is a crucial requirement for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles~(AVs) and enables a comprehensive safety evaluation of automated driving systems. To that end, this paper presents a novel probabilistic occupancy risk assessment~(PORA) metric. It uses spatiotemporal heatmaps as probabilistic occupancy predictions of surrounding traffic participants and estimates the risk of a collision along an AV's planned trajectory based on potential vehicle interactions. The use of probabilistic occupancy allows PORA to account for the uncertainty in future trajectories and velocities of traffic participants in the risk estimates. The risk from potential vehicle interactions is then further adjusted through a Cox model\edit{,} which considers the relative \edit{motion} between the AV and surrounding traffic participants. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the accuracy of collision risk assessment in dynamic traffic scenarios, resulting in safer vehicle controllers, and provides a robust framework for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving systems. From evaluation in Monte Carlo simulations, PORA is shown to be more effective at accurately characterizing collision risk compared to other safety surrogate measures.

      <title>Human2Robot: Learning Robot Actions from Paired Human-Robot Videos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16587v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distilling knowledge from human demonstrations is a promising way for robots to learn and act. Existing methods, which often rely on coarsely-aligned video pairs, are typically constrained to learning global or task-level features. As a result, they tend to neglect the fine-grained frame-level dynamics required for complex manipulation and generalization to novel tasks. We posit that this limitation stems from a vicious circle of inadequate datasets and the methods they inspire. To break this cycle, we propose a paradigm shift that treats fine-grained human-robot alignment as a conditional video generation problem. To this end, we first introduce H&amp;R, a novel third-person dataset containing 2,600 episodes of precisely synchronized human and robot motions, collected using a VR teleoperation system. We then present Human2Robot, a framework designed to leverage this data. Human2Robot employs a Video Prediction Model to learn a rich and implicit representation of robot dynamics by generating robot videos from human input, which in turn guides a decoupled action decoder. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that this approach not only achieves high performance on seen tasks but also exhibits significant one-shot generalization to novel positions, objects, instances, and even new task categories.</description>

      <title>DexGraspVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Framework Towards General Dexterous Grasping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20900v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in robotics. A general-purpose robot must be capable of grasping diverse objects in arbitrary scenarios. However, existing research typically relies on restrictive assumptions, such as single-object settings or limited environments, showing constrained generalization. We present DexGraspVLA, a hierarchical framework for robust generalization in language-guided general dexterous grasping and beyond. It utilizes a pre-trained Vision-Language model as the high-level planner and learns a diffusion-based low-level Action controller. The key insight to achieve generalization lies in iteratively transforming diverse language and visual inputs into domain-invariant representations via foundation models, where imitation learning can be effectively applied due to the alleviation of domain shift. Notably, our method achieves a 90+% dexterous grasping success rate under thousands of challenging unseen cluttered scenes. Empirical analysis confirms the consistency of internal model behavior across environmental variations, validating our design. DexGraspVLA also, for the first time, simultaneously demonstrates free-form long-horizon prompt execution, robustness to adversarial objects and human disturbance, and failure recovery. Extended application to nonprehensile grasping further proves its generality. Project website: https://dexgraspvla.github.io.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most current end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving algorithms are built on standard vehicles in structured transportation scenarios, lacking exploration of robot navigation for unstructured scenarios such as auxiliary roads, campus roads, and indoor settings. This paper investigates E2E robot navigation in unstructured road environments. First, we introduce two data collection pipelines - one for real-world robot data and another for synthetic data generated using the Isaac Sim simulator, which together produce an unstructured robotics navigation dataset -- FreeWorld Dataset. Second, we fine-tuned an efficient E2E autonomous driving model -- VAD -- using our datasets to validate the performance and adaptability of E2E autonomous driving models in these environments. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning through our datasets significantly enhances the navigation potential of E2E autonomous driving models in unstructured robotic environments. Thus, this paper presents the first dataset targeting E2E robot navigation tasks in unstructured scenarios, and provides a benchmark based on vision-based E2E autonomous driving algorithms to facilitate the development of E2E navigation technology for logistics and service robots. The project is available on Github.</description>

      <title>Sequential Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a 2-D autonomous exploration and mapping framework for LiDAR-based SLAM mobile robots, designed to address the major challenges on low-cost platforms, including process instability, map drift, and increased risks of collisions and deadlocks. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. For local exploration, the proposed Self-Convergent RRT (SC-RRT) efficiently covers the reachable space within a finite time while the robot remains stationary, without relying on motion-induced sampling diversity. In addition, traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is employed to generate motion trajectories that are more amenable to stable scan matching. The resulting straight-segment and in-place-rotation pattern improves scan-matching robustness and effectively suppresses map drift on resource-constrained platforms. For the process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillations caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is incorporated to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency. Experiments in challenging simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves higher mapping success rates and stronger robustness on resource-constrained robots and maintains consistent mapping quality across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Contextual Sampling for Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-Driven Predictive Control (DPC) optimizes system behavior directly from measured trajectories without requiring an explicit model. However, its computational cost scales with dataset size, limiting real-time applicability to nonlinear robotic systems. For robotic tasks such as trajectory tracking and motion planning, real-time feasibility and numerical robustness are essential. Nonlinear DPC often relies on large datasets or learned nonlinear representations to ensure accuracy, both of which increase computational demand. We propose Contextual Sampling, a dynamic data selection strategy that adaptively selects the most relevant trajectories based on the current state and reference. By reducing dataset size while preserving representativeness, it improves computational efficiency. Experiments on a scaled autonomous vehicle and a quadrotor show that Contextual Sampling achieves comparable or better tracking than Random Sampling with fewer trajectories, enabling real-time feasibility. Compared with Select-DPC, it achieves similar tracking accuracy at lower computational cost. In comparison with the full DPC formulation without sampling, Contextual Sampling attains comparable tracking performance while requiring less computation, highlighting the benefit of efficient data selection in data-driven predictive control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation holds transformative potential for daily service and industrial tasks, yet achieving precise, robust whole-body control with 3D end-effector force interaction remains a major challenge. Prior approaches are often limited to lightweight tasks or quadrupedal/wheeled platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose FALCON, a dual-agent reinforcement-learning-based framework for robust force-adaptive humanoid loco-manipulation. FALCON decomposes whole-body control into two specialized agents: (1) a lower-body agent ensuring stable locomotion under external force disturbances, and (2) an upper-body agent precisely tracking end-effector positions with implicit adaptive force compensation. These two agents are jointly trained in simulation with a force curriculum that progressively escalates the magnitude of external force exerted on the end effector while respecting torque limits. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to the baselines, FALCON achieves 2x more accurate upper-body joint tracking, while maintaining robust locomotion under force disturbances and achieving faster training convergence. Moreover, FALCON enables policy training without embodiment-specific reward or curriculum tuning. Using the same training setup, we obtain policies that are deployed across multiple humanoids, enabling forceful loco-manipulation tasks such as transporting payloads (0-20N force), cart-pulling (0-100N), and door-opening (0-40N) in the real world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Testing cloud-controlled intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) requires simulation environments that faithfully emulate both vehicle behavior and realistic communication latencies. This paper proposes a latency-aware co-simulation platform integrating CarMaker and Vissim to evaluate safety and comfort under real-world vehicle-to-cloud (V2C) latency conditions. Two communication latency models, derived from empirical 5G measurements in China and Hungary, are incorporated and statistically modeled using Gamma distributions. A proactive conflict module (PCM) is proposed to dynamically control background vehicles and generate safety-critical scenarios. The platform is validated through experiments involving an exemplary system under test (SUT) across six testing conditions combining two PCM modes (enabled/disabled) and three latency conditions (none, China, Hungary). Safety and comfort are assessed using metrics including collision rate, distance headway, post-encroachment time, and the spectral characteristics of longitudinal acceleration. Results show that the PCM effectively increases driving environment criticality, while V2C latency primarily affects ride comfort. These findings confirm the platform's effectiveness in systematically evaluating cloud-controlled ICVs under diverse testing conditions.</description>

      <title>Whole-Body Control Framework for Humanoid Robots with Heavy Limbs: A Model-Based Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid robots often face significant balance issues due to the motion of their heavy limbs. These challenges are particularly pronounced when attempting dynamic motion or operating in environments with irregular terrain. To address this challenge, this manuscript proposes a whole-body control framework for humanoid robots with heavy limbs, using a model-based approach that combines a kino-dynamics planner and a hierarchical optimization problem. The kino-dynamics planner is designed as a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to account for the impact of heavy limbs on mass and inertia distribution. By simplifying the robot's system dynamics and constraints, the planner enables real-time planning of motion and contact forces. The hierarchical optimization problem is formulated using Hierarchical Quadratic Programming (HQP) to minimize limb control errors and ensure compliance with the policy generated by the kino-dynamics planner. Experimental validation of the proposed framework demonstrates its effectiveness. The humanoid robot with heavy limbs controlled by the proposed framework can achieve dynamic walking speeds of up to 1.2~m/s, respond to external disturbances of up to 60~N, and maintain balance on challenging terrains such as uneven surfaces, and outdoor environments.</description>

Abstract: Task-Oriented Grasping (TOG) requires robots to select grasps that are functionally appropriate for a specified task - a challenge that demands an understanding of task semantics, object affordances, and functional constraints. We present GRIM (Grasp Re-alignment via Iterative Matching), a training-free framework that addresses these challenges by leveraging Video Generation Models (VGMs) together with a retrieve-align-transfer pipeline. Beyond leveraging VGMs, GRIM can construct a memory of object-task exemplars sourced from web images, human demonstrations, or generative models. The retrieved task-oriented grasp is then transferred and refined by evaluating it against a set of geometrically stable candidate grasps to ensure both functional suitability and physical feasibility. GRIM demonstrates strong generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard TOG benchmarks. Project website: https://grim-tog.github.io</description>

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands are essential for performing complex manipulation tasks, yet remain difficult to train due to the challenges of demonstration collection and high-dimensional control. While reinforcement learning (RL) can alleviate the data bottleneck by generating experience in simulation, it typically relies on carefully designed, task-specific reward functions, which hinder scalability and generalization. Thus, contemporary works in dexterous manipulation have often bootstrapped from reference trajectories. These trajectories specify target hand poses that guide the exploration of RL policies and object poses that enable dense, task-agnostic rewards. However, sourcing suitable trajectories - particularly for dexterous hands - remains a significant challenge. Yet, the precise details in explicit reference trajectories are often unnecessary, as RL ultimately refines the motion. Our key insight is that modern vision-language models (VLMs) already encode the commonsense spatial and semantic knowledge needed to specify tasks and guide exploration effectively. Given a task description (e.g., "open the cabinet") and a visual scene, our method uses an off-the-shelf VLM to first identify task-relevant keypoints (e.g., handles, buttons) and then synthesize 3D trajectories for hand motion and object motion. Subsequently, we train a low-level residual RL policy in simulation to track these coarse trajectories or "scaffolds" with high fidelity. Across a number of simulated tasks involving articulated objects and semantic understanding, we demonstrate that our method is able to learn robust dexterous manipulation policies. Moreover, we showcase that our method transfers to real-world robotic hands without any human demonstrations or handcrafted rewards.</description>

      <title>HumanoidGen: Data Generation for Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation via LLM Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For robotic manipulation, existing robotics datasets and simulation benchmarks predominantly cater to robot-arm platforms. However, for humanoid robots equipped with dual arms and dexterous hands, simulation tasks and high-quality demonstrations are notably lacking. Bimanual dexterous manipulation is inherently more complex, as it requires coordinated arm movements and hand operations, making autonomous data collection challenging. This paper presents HumanoidGen, an automated task creation and demonstration collection framework that leverages atomic dexterous operations and LLM reasoning to generate relational constraints. Specifically, we provide spatial annotations for both assets and dexterous hands based on the atomic operations, and perform an LLM planner to generate a chain of actionable spatial constraints for arm movements based on object affordances and scenes. To further improve planning ability, we employ a variant of Monte Carlo tree search to enhance LLM reasoning for long-horizon tasks and insufficient annotation. In experiments, we create a novel benchmark with augmented scenarios to evaluate the quality of the collected data. The results show that the performance of the 2D and 3D diffusion policies can scale with the generated dataset. Project page is https://openhumanoidgen.github.io.</description>

      <title>TopAY: Efficient Trajectory Planning for Differential Drive Mobile Manipulators via Topological Paths Search and Arc Length-Yaw Parameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential drive mobile manipulators combine the mobility of wheeled bases with the manipulation capability of multi-joint arms, enabling versatile applications but posing considerable challenges for trajectory planning due to their high-dimensional state space and nonholonomic constraints. This paper introduces TopAY, an optimization-based planning framework designed for efficient and safe trajectory generation for differential drive mobile manipulators. The framework employs a hierarchical initial value acquisition strategy, including topological paths search for the base and parallel sampling for the manipulator. A polynomial trajectory representation with arc length-yaw parameterization is also proposed to reduce optimization complexity while preserving dynamic feasibility. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate that TopAY achieves higher planning efficiency and success rates than state-of-the-art method in dense and complex scenarios.

      <title>Certified Coil Geometry Learning for Short-Range Magnetic Actuation and Spacecraft Docking Application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based framework for approximating an exact magnetic-field interaction model, supported by both numerical and experimental validation. High-fidelity magnetic-field interaction modeling is essential for achieving exceptional accuracy and responsiveness across a wide range of fields, including transportation, energy systems, medicine, biomedical robotics, and aerospace robotics. In aerospace engineering, magnetic actuation has been investigated as a fuel-free solution for multi-satellite attitude and formation control. Although the exact magnetic field can be computed from the Biot-Savart law, the associated computational cost is prohibitive, and prior studies have therefore relied on dipole approximations to improve efficiency. However, these approximations lose accuracy during proximity operations, leading to unstable behavior and even collisions. To address this limitation, we develop a learning-based approximation framework that faithfully reproduces the exact field while dramatically reducing computational cost. The proposed method additionally provides a certified error bound, derived from the number of training samples, ensuring reliable prediction accuracy. The learned model can also accommodate interactions between coils of different sizes through appropriate geometric transformations, without retraining. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework under challenging conditions, a spacecraft docking scenario is examined through both numerical simulations and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLM Privacy Recognition for Social Robot Decision Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Humanoid Robot Locomotion with Symmetry Equivariant Reinforcement Learning Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability to humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>MASt3R-Fusion: Integrating Feed-Forward Visual Model with IMU, GNSS for High-Functionality SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).</description>

      <title>GUIDES: Guidance Using Instructor-Distilled Embeddings for Pre-trained Robot Policy Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space, allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief, targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions. Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping. Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade, rather than replace, validated robot policies.</description>

      <title>Scalable Policy Evaluation with Video World Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline. Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.</description>

      <title>Automating RT Planning at Scale: High Quality Data For AI Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11803v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiotherapy (RT) planning is complex, subjective, and time-intensive. Advances with artificial intelligence (AI) promise to improve its precision and efficiency, but progress is often limited by the scarcity of large, standardized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Automated Iterative RT Planning (AIRTP) system, a scalable solution for generating high-quality treatment plans. This scalable solution is designed to generate substantial volumes of consistently high-quality treatment plans, overcoming a key obstacle in the advancement of AI-driven RT planning. Our AIRTP pipeline adheres to clinical guidelines and automates essential steps, including organ-at-risk (OAR) contouring, helper structure creation, beam setup, optimization, and plan quality improvement, using AI integrated with RT planning software like Varian Eclipse. Furthermore, a novel approach for determining optimization parameters to reproduce 3D dose distributions, i.e. a method to convert dose predictions to deliverable treatment plans constrained by machine limitations is proposed. A comparative analysis of plan quality reveals that our automated pipeline produces treatment plans of quality comparable to those generated manually, which traditionally require several hours of labor per plan. Committed to public research, the first data release of our AIRTP pipeline includes nine cohorts covering head-and-neck and lung cancer sites to support an AAPM 2025 challenge. To our best knowledge, this dataset features more than 10 times number of plans compared to the largest existing well-curated public dataset.

      <title>Reward Redistribution via Gaussian Process Likelihood Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many practical reinforcement learning tasks, feedback is only provided at the end of a long horizon, leading to sparse and delayed rewards. Existing reward redistribution methods typically assume that per-step rewards are independent, thus overlooking interdependencies among state-action pairs. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process based Likelihood Reward Redistribution (GP-LRR) framework that addresses this issue by modeling the reward function as a sample from a Gaussian process, which explicitly captures dependencies between state-action pairs through the kernel function. By maximizing the likelihood of the observed episodic return via a leave-one-out strategy that leverages the entire trajectory, our framework inherently introduces uncertainty regularization. Moreover, we show that conventional mean-squared-error (MSE) based reward redistribution arises as a special case of our GP-LRR framework when using a degenerate kernel without observation noise. When integrated with an off-policy algorithm such as Soft Actor-Critic, GP-LRR yields dense and informative reward signals, resulting in superior sample efficiency and policy performance on several MuJoCo benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-horizon planning is crucial in complex environments, but diffusion-based planners like Diffuser are limited by the trajectory lengths observed during training. This creates a dilemma: long trajectories are needed for effective planning, yet they degrade model performance. In this paper, we introduce this extendable long-horizon planning challenge and propose a two-phase solution. First, Progressive Trajectory Extension incrementally constructs longer trajectories through multi-round compositional stitching. Second, the Hierarchical Multiscale Diffuser enables efficient training and inference over long horizons by reasoning across temporal scales. To avoid the need for multiple separate models, we propose Adaptive Plan Pondering and the Recursive HM-Diffuser, which unify hierarchical planning within a single model. Experiments show our approach yields strong performance gains, advancing scalable and efficient decision-making over long-horizons.</description>

Abstract: Optics is foundational to research in many areas of science and engineering, including nanophotonics, quantum information, materials science, biomedical imaging, and metrology. However, the design, assembly, and alignment of optical experiments remain predominantly manual, limiting throughput and reproducibility. Automating such experiments is challenging due to the strict, non-negotiable precision requirements and the diversity of optical configurations found in typical laboratories. Here, we introduce a platform that integrates generative artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics to automate free-space optical experiments. The platform translates user-defined goals into valid optical configurations, assembles them using a robotic arm, and performs micrometer-scale fine alignment using a robot-deployable tool. It then executes a range of automated measurements, including beam characterization, polarization mapping, and spectroscopy, with consistency surpassing that of human operators. This work demonstrates the first flexible, AI-driven automation platform for optics, offering a path towards remote operation, cloud labs, and high-throughput discovery in the optical sciences.</description>

      <title>Task-Driven Implicit Representations for Automated Design of LiDAR Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging system design is a complex, time-consuming, and largely manual process; LiDAR design, ubiquitous in mobile devices, autonomous vehicles, and aerial imaging platforms, adds further complexity through unique spatial and temporal sampling requirements. In this work, we propose a framework for automated, task-driven LiDAR system design under arbitrary constraints. To achieve this, we represent LiDAR configurations in a continuous six-dimensional design space and learn task-specific implicit densities in this space via flow-based generative modeling. We then synthesize new LiDAR systems by modeling sensors as parametric distributions in 6D space and fitting these distributions to our learned implicit density using expectation-maximization, enabling efficient, constraint-aware LiDAR system design. We validate our method on diverse tasks in 3D vision, enabling automated LiDAR system design across real-world-inspired applications in face scanning, robotic tracking, and object detection.</description>

      <title>MonoDream: Monocular Vision-Language Navigation with Panoramic Dreaming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.</description>

Abstract: Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent. While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes a new performance frontier for MAPF.</description>
