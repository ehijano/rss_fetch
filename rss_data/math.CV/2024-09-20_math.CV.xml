      <title>Competitive Hele-Shaw flow and quadratic differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a generalization of the Hele-Shaw flow with injection where several droplets compete for space as they try to expand due to internal pressure while still preserving their topology. Droplets are described by their closed non-crossing interface curves in $\mathbb{C}$ or more generally in a Riemann surface of finite type. Our main focus is on stationary solutions which we show correspond to the critical vertical trajectories of a particular quadratic differential with second order poles at the source points. The quadratic differentials that arise in this way have a simple description in terms of their associated half-translation surfaces. Existence of stationary solutions is proved in some generality by solving an extremal problem involving an electrostatic energy functional, generalizing a classic problem studied by Teichm\"uller, Jenkins, Strebel and others. We study several special cases, including stationary Jordan curves on the Riemann sphere. We also introduce a discrete random version of the dynamics closely related to Propp's competitive erosion model, and conjecture that realizations of the lattice model will converge towards a corresponding solution to the competitive Hele-Shaw problem as the mesh size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Exponential sums equations and the Exponential Closedness conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an expository paper aiming to introduce Zilber's Exponential Closedness conjecture to a general audience. Exponential Closedness predicts when (systems of) equations involving addition, multiplication, and exponentiation have solutions in the complex numbers. It is a natural statement at the boundary between complex geometry and algebraic geometry. While it is open in full generality, many special cases and variants have been proven in the last two decades.
  In the first part of the paper we give an elementary proof to a special case of the conjecture, namely, we show that exponential sums in a single complex variable, such as $e^{\sqrt{2}z}+3i e^{5z}+\pi$, always have zeroes. This statement follows from the recent results of Gallinaro and Mantova--Masser, and our proof is motivated by the ideas of Zilber and Gallinaro. However, our approach uses only elementary techniques (from standard undergraduate algebra and complex analysis) and the proofs of some of the main ingredients appear to be new. Moreover, these ingredients come from various areas of mathematics, such as functional transcendence and complex geometry, and are a useful way of introducing some classical concepts in these areas to the reader.
  In the second part we explain the Exponential Closedness conjecture and discuss some known special cases, not least the so-called ``raising to powers'' case (due to Gallinaro) which generalises the main theorem of the first part.</description>

      <title>Complex solutions of polynomial equations on the unit circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore systems of polynomial equations where we seek complex solutions with absolute value 1. Geometrically, this amounts to understanding intersections of algebraic varieties with tori -- Cartesian powers of the unit circle. We study the properties of varieties in which this intersection is Zariski dense, give a criterion for Zariski density and use it to show that the problem is decidable. This problem is a ``continuous'' analogue of the Manin-Mumford conjecture for the multiplicative group of complex numbers, however, the results are very different from Manin-Mumford.
  While the results of the paper appear to be new, the proofs are quite elementary. This is an expository article aiming to introduce some classical mathematical topics to a general audience. We also list some exercises and problems at the end for the curious reader to further explore these topics.</description>

      <title>Marked points of families of hyperbolic automorphisms of smooth complex projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\pi : X\to \Lambda$ be a flat family of smooth complex projective varieties parameterized by a smooth quasi-projective variety $\Lambda$, and let $f: X\to X$ be a family of automorphisms with positive topological entropy. Suppose $\sigma : \Lambda \to X$ is a marked point, i.e., it is a rational section of $\pi$. We propose two methods to measure the stability, normality, or periodicity of the family given by $t \mapsto f_t^n(\sigma(t))$.
  First, from an algebraic perspective, we construct geometric canonical height functions that have desirable properties. Second, from an analytic viewpoint, we construct a positive closed $(1,1)$-current with continuous local potential. When $\Lambda$ is a curve, we demonstrate that these two constructions actually coincide, providing a unified approach to understanding the dynamical behavior of the family.</description>

      <title>Curvature formulas and curvature strict positivity of direct image bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the curvature strict positivity of direct image bundles (vector bundles) associated to a strictly pseudoconvex family of bounded domains.The main result is that the curvature of the direct image bundle associated to a strictly pseudoconvex family of bounded domains is strictly positive in the sense of Nakano even if the curvature of the original vector bundle is just Nakano positive. Based on our (I and my coauthors) previous results, this result further demonstrates that strictly pseudoconvex domains and pseudoconvex domains have very different geometric properties. To consider the curvature strict positivity, we will first construct a curvature formula for a direct image bundle, then the curvature strict positivity will be a simple consequence of it. As applications to convex analysis, we get a corresponding version of Pr\'ekopa's Theorem, i.e., we get the curvature strict positivity of a strictly convex family of bounded domains.In the last, we give a flatness criterion for the direct image bundles.onvex family of bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic approximation by polynomials with exponents restricted to a convex cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study approximations of holomorphic functions of several complex variables by proper subrings of the polynomials. The subrings in question consist of polynomials of several complex variables whose exponents are restricted to a prescribed convex cone $\mathbb{R}_+S$ for some compact convex $S\in \mathbb{R}^n_+$. Analogous to the polynomial hull of a set, we denote the hull of $K$ with respect to the given ring by can define hulls of a set $K$ with respect to the given ring, here denoted $\widehat K{}^S$. By studying an extremal function $V^S_K(z)$, we show a version of the Runge-Oka-Weil Theorem on approximation by these subrings on compact subsets of $\mathbb{C}^{*n}$ that satisfy $K= \widehat K{}^S$ and $V^{S*}_K|_K=0$. We show a sharper result for compact Reinhardt sets $K$, that a holomorphic function is uniformly approximable on $\widehat K{}^S$ by members of the ring if and only if it is bounded on $\widehat K{}^S$. We also show that if $K$ is a compact Reinhardt subsets of $\mathbb{C}^{*n}$, then we have $V^S_K(z)=\sup_{s\in S} (\langle s ,{\operatorname{Log}\, z}\rangle- \varphi_A(s)) $, where $\varphi_A$ is the supporting function of $A=\operatorname{Log}\, K= \{(\log|z_1|,\dots, \log|z_n|) \,;\, z\in K\}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the absolute period foliation of a stratum of holomorphic 1-forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12669v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a connected component of a stratum of the moduli space of holomorphic $1$-forms of genus $g$. We show that the absolute period foliation of $\mathcal{C}$ is ergodic on the area-$1$ locus, and that the non-dense leaves lie in an explicit countable union of suborbifolds, subject to a mild assumption on $\mathcal{C}$. We show similar results for subspaces of $\mathcal{C}$ defined by topological restrictions on the absolute periods. We obtain these dynamical results by showing that for a typical positive cohomology class in $H^1(S_g;\mathbb{C})$, the associated space of isoperiodic forms in $\mathcal{C}$ is connected. Lastly, we show that certain covering constructions provide examples of spaces of isoperiodic forms with positive dimension and infinitely many connected components.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metric (I): a priori estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact K\"ahler manifold. In this paper we study the existence of constant weighted scalar curvature K\"ahler (weighted cscK) metrics on $X$. More precisely, we establish a priori $C^{k}$-estimates ($k\geq 0$) for the K\"ahler potential associated with these metrics, thereby extending a result due to Chen and Cheng in the classical cscK setting.</description>
