      <title>Study on the SDW and Superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) with $T_c\approx 80$ K in the pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has aroused great interests. Currently, due to technical difficulties, most experiments on La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ can only be performed at ambient pressure (AP). Particularly, various experiments have revealed the presence of spin-density wave (SDW) in the unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern with wave vector near $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. In this work, we employ first-principle calculations followed by the random phase approximation (RPA)-based study to clarify the origin of this special SDW pattern and potential SC in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP. Starting from our density-functional-theory (DFT) band structure, we construct an eight-band bilayer tight-binding model using the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which is equipped with the standard multi-orbital Hubbard interaction. Our RPA calculation reveals an SDW order driven by Fermi-surface nesting with wave vector $Q\approx(0,0.84\pi)$ in the folded Brillouin zone (BZ). From view in the unfolded BZ, the wave vector turns to $Q_0\approx(0.42\pi,0.42\pi)$, which is near the one detected by various experiments. Further more, this SDW exhibits an interlayer antiferromagnetic order with a unidirectional diagonal double-stripe pattern, consistent with recent soft X-ray scattering experiment. This result suggests that the origin of the SDW order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ at AP can be well understood in the itinerant picture as driven by FS-nesting. In the aspect of SC, our RPA study yields an approximate $s^\pm$-wave spin-singlet pairing with $T_c$ considerably lower than that under high pressure, which is consistent with experiments. Furthermore, the $T_c$ can be strongly enhanced through hole doping, leading to possible high-temperature SC in the material.</description>

      <title>Atypical vortex lattice and the magnetic penetration depth in superconducting Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ deduced by $\mu$SR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) technique has been applied to determine the behavior of the in-plane magnetic penetration depth ($\lambda_{ab}$) in the vortex state of the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as a means of gaining insight into its still unknown superconducting order parameter. A recent $\mu$SR study of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ reported a $T$-linear temperature dependence for $\lambda_{ab}$ at low temperatures that was not identified in an earlier $\mu$SR study. Here we show that there is no significant difference between the data in the early and recent $\mu$SR studies and both are compatible with the limiting low-temperature $\lambda_{ab} \sim T^2$ dependence expected from measurements of the change in $\lambda_{ab}(T)$ in the Meissner state by other techniques. However, we argue that at this time there is no valid theoretical model for reliably determining the absolute value of $\lambda_{ab}$ in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ from $\mu$SR measurements. Instead, we identify the formation of an unusual square vortex lattice that introduces a new constraint on candidate superconducting order parameters for Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Critical Temperature and Superfluid Density of a Metal-Superconductor Bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising path to realizing higher superconducting transition temperatures $T_c$ is the strategic engineering of artificial heterostructures. For example, quantum materials exhibiting some but not all of the characteristics necessary for a robust superconducting state could, in principle, be coupled with other materials in a way that alleviates their intrinsic shortcomings. In this work, we add numerical support to the hypothesis that a strongly interacting superconductor weakened by phase fluctuations can boost its $T_c$ by hybridizing the system with a metal. Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), we simulate a two-dimensional bilayer composed of an attractive Hubbard model and a metallic layer in two regimes of the interaction strength $-|U|$. In the strongly interacting regime, we find that increasing the interlayer hybridization $t_\perp$ results in a nonmonotonic enhancement of $T_c$, with an optimal value comparable to the maximum $T_c$ observed in the single-layer attractive Hubbard model, confirming trends inferred from other approaches. In the intermediate coupling regime, when $-|U|$ is close to the value associated with the maximum $T_c$ of the single-layer model, increasing $t_\perp$ tends to decrease $T_c$, implying that the correlated layer was already optimally tuned. Importantly, we demonstrate that the mechanism behind these trends is related to enhancement in the superfluid stiffness, as was initially proposed by Kivelson [Physica B: Condensed Matter 318, 61 (2002)].</description>

      <title>Determination of the London penetration depth with the tunnel diode oscillator technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a distribution of the Meissner currents over the surface of an infinitely long superconducting slab with a rectangular cross section, the magnetic moment of the slab is calculated, taking into account corrections associated with a small but finite value of the London penetration depth $\lambda$. Since these corrections determine the shift of the resonant frequency in the tunnel diode oscillator technique, formulas for determination of $\lambda$ within this technique are derived for the slab. These formulas are valid for any aspect ratio of its cross section, and they differ from those that are often used in analyzing experimental data. Namely, it is shown that sharp edges of the slab can cause the large frequency shift proportional to the change in the value of $\lambda^{2/3}$. Although this result complicates the extraction of a temperature dependence of $\lambda$ from the frequency shift, it also opens up new possibilities in determining the London penetration depth. In particular, under certain conditions, it is possible not only to measure the changes in $\lambda$ with the temperature, but also to estimate its absolute value.</description>

      <title>Overdoping YBa2Cu3O7 via a heterostructure with La0.67Sr0.33MnO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YBa2Cu3Ox, the first superconductor discovered with Tc higher than 77 K, is among the most complex cuprates having both CuO chains and plains in the structure. YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) exhibits slightly overdoped behavior and further doping is difficult as all the lattice sites in the CuO chains are occupied. We have grown high quality single crystalline films of YBCO and bilayer La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (LSMO)/YBCO exhibiting superconductivity in both the cases. Photoemission spectra reveal different surface and bulk electronic structures; the difference reduces in the bilayer. Evidence of charge transfer across the bilayer interface is observed in the valence band and core level spectra indicating an overdoped condition in YBCO. While superconductivity in the presence of magnetic order in the bilayer is puzzling, this pathway to reach overdoped regime in YBCO opens up a new landscape to probe the exotic physics of unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Low volume fraction of high-Tc superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at 80 K and ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in pressurized La3Ni2O7 with a transition temperature of approximately 80 K above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen has sparked significant attention. It is essential to search for high-temperature superconductivity in bulk samples and at ambient pressure in nickelates. In this study, we report influential factors that affect the appearance of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 at ambient pressure. From direct-current magnetic measurements, we observe a clear diamagnetic response at 80 K in post-annealed single crystals of La3Ni2O7 in oxygen. The superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be within 0.2%, resulting in a decrease in resistivity. This work presents a practical approach for further investigating high-temperature superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

      <title>Melting through Barrier-Crossing: The Role of Equilibrium Thermally Activated Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Melting is often understood in purely equilibrium terms, where crystalline order disappears once the free energy of the solid equals that of the liquid. Yet at the microscopic level, the initiating events for melting can often be traced to the formation of defects or local ``jumps'' over interatomic barriers. In this work, we offer a unified interpretation of melting by focusing on the equilibrium fraction of particles whose energy exceeds a characteristic barrier \(E_a\). We show that when this fraction surpasses a small but critical threshold \cite{Feder1958,Kraftmakher1998} (on the order of \(10^{-4}\)-\(10^{-3}\)), the crystal loses its rigidity, thus reconciling Born's mechanical-instability picture with the older Lindemann notion of large atomic displacements. We derive this threshold condition from standard Boltzmann (and Bose/Fermi) statistics, ensuring consistency with standard thermodynamics. Our approach naturally extends to vortex lattices in superconductors (where vortex activation energies play the role of \(E_a\)) and to quantum-lattice systems (Hubbard-type models). Crucially, while the interpretation emphasizes barrier crossing, the criterion itself is built on equilibrium statistical mechanics, offering a transparent link between defect formation rates and the macroscopic transition.</description>

      <title>Critical Current Density and AC Magnetic Susceptibility of High-quality FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ Superconducting Tapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron telluride-selenium superconducting materials, known for their non-toxicity, ease of preparation, simple structure, and high upper critical fields, have attracted much research interest in practical application. In this work, we conducted electrical transport measurements, magneto-optical imaging, and AC magnetic susceptibility measurements on FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ superconducting long tapes fabricated via reel-to-reel pulsed laser deposition. Our transport measurements revealed a high critical current density that remains relatively stable even with increasing external magnetic fields, reaching over $1\times 10^5$ A/cm$^2$ at 8 K and 9 T. The calculated pinning force density indicates that normal point pinning is the primary mechanism in these tapes. The magneto-optical images demonstrated that the tapes show homogeneous superconductivity and uniform distribution of critical current density. The AC magnetic susceptibility measurements also confirmed their strong flux pinning nature of withstanding high magnetic field. Based on these characteristics, FeTe$_{0.5}$Se$_{0.5}$ superconducting tapes show promising prospects for applications under high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Origin of performance enhancement of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors by He-ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are indispensable in fields such as quantum science and technology, astronomy, and biomedical imaging, where high detection efficiency, low dark count rates and high timing accuracy are required. Recently, helium (He) ion irradiation was shown to be a promising method to enhance SNSPD performance. Here, we study how changes in the underlying superconducting NbTiN film and the SiO2/Si substrate affect device performance. While irradiated and unirradiated NbTiN films show similar crystallinity, we observe He bubble formation below the SiO2/Si interface and an amorphization of the Si substrate. Both reduce the thermal conductance between the superconducting thin film and the substrate from 210 W/m^2/K^4 to 70 W/m^2/K^4 after irradiation with 2000 ions/nm^2. This effect, combined with the lateral straggle of He ions in the substrate, allows the modification of the superconductor-to-substrate thermal conductance of an SNSPD by selectively irradiating the regions around the nanowire. With this approach, we achieved an increased plateau width of saturating intrinsic detection efficiency of 9.8 uA compared to 3.7 uA after full irradiation. Moreover, the critical current remained similar to that of the unirradiated reference device (59 uA versus 60.1 uA), while full irradiation reduced it to 22.4 uA. Our results suggest that the irradiation-induced reduction of the thermal conductance significantly enhances SNSPD sensitivity, offering a novel approach to locally engineer substrate properties for improved detector performance.</description>

      <title>Spin nematic order and superconductivity in $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate competition and cooperation of magnetic frustration and the Kondo effect in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Kondo lattice model on the square lattice at zero temperature. In this model, the frustrated interactions $J_1,J_2$ between the localized spins stabilize spin nematic orders, while the Kondo coupling favors local spin singlets. Using the slave boson mean field approximation, we find that the spin nematic order remains stable against small Kondo coupling, and the localized spins and the conduction electrons are effectively decoupled. On the other hand, a standard Fermi liquid state is formed for sufficiently strong Kondo interactions. Furthermore, in an intermediate region with moderate Kondo coupling, the spin nematic order and the Kondo effect coexist, and superconducting pairing of the conduction electrons is induced by the spinon pairing. We discuss the ground state phase diagram and nature of the quantum phase transitions between the different superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Superconducting and Topological Properties in Mg-Li Electrides at High Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides as a unique class of emerging materials exhibit fascinating properties and hold important significance for understanding the matter under extreme conditions, which is characterized by valence electrons localized into the interstitial space as quasi-atoms (ISQs). In this work, using crystal structure prediction and first-principles calculations, we identified seven stable phases of Mg-Li that are electride with novel electronic properties under high pressure. Among them, MgLi10 is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.22 eV; and Pm-3m MgLi is superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature of 22.8 K. The important role played by the localization degree of ISQ in the superconducting transition temperature of these electrides is revealed by systematic comparison of Mg-Li with other Li-rich electride superconductors. Furthermore, we proved that Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi also have distinct topological behavior with metallic surface states and the non-zero $Z_2$ invariant. The simultaneous coexistence of superconductivity, electronic band topology and electride property in the same structure of Pm-3m MgLi and Pnma MgLi demonstrates the feasibility of realizing multi-quantum phases in a single material, which will stimulate further research in these interdisciplinary fields.</description>

      <title>The significance of "stripes" in the physics of the cuprates, the Hubbard model, and other highly correlated electronic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: "Stripes" - meaning unidirectional charge-density-waves, sometimes (but not always) accompanied by spin-density-waves with twice the period - are now known to arise in broad swathes of the cuprate phase diagram, and appear as a strong ordering tendency in numerical studies of Hubbard-like models of highly correlated electron systems. Jan Zaanen's work played a seminal role in predicting their existence, and exploring their possible significance. They are {\it not} related to any weak-coupling physics associated with some form of Fermi-surface nesting. And whether one likes them or not, they are surprisingly difficult to avoid; in the Hubbard model, for example, they often appear as an alternative order that can out-compete the otherwise favored $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Absence of two-phonon quasi-elastic scattering in the normal state of doped--SrTiO$_3$ by THz pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-pulse nonlinear THz spectroscopies enable a new understanding of interacting metallic systems via their sensitivity to novel correlation functions. Here, we investigated the THz nonlinear properties of the dilute metallic phase of doped-SrTiO$_3$ thin films using nonlinear terahertz 2D coherent spectroscopy. We observed a large $\chi^{(3)}$ response in the low temperature region where the dc electrical resistivity follows a T$^2$-dependence. This is largely a pump-probe response, which we find is governed by a single energy relaxation rate that is much smaller at all temperatures than the momentum relaxation rates obtained from the optical conductivity. This indicates that the processes that dominate the resistive scattering are not the same as those that remove energy from the electronic system. Moreover the fact that the energy relaxation rate is an increasing function of temperature indicates that the excitations that do carry away energy from the electronic system cannot be considered as quasi-elastic and as such soft two-phonon electron scattering does not play a major role in the physics as proposed. This indicates that these materials' resistive T$^2$ scattering likely originates in electron-electron interactions despite the very small Fermi wave vectors at the lowest dopings.</description>

      <title>Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric properties of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene-superconductor hetero-junction: effect of valley polarization and trigonal warping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the thermoelectric properties (electronic contribution) of a normal-superconductor (NS) hybrid junction, where the normal region consists of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). The superconducting region is characterized by a common $s$-wave superconductor closely proximitized to the MATBG. We compute various thermoelectric coefficients, including thermal conductance, thermopower, and the figure of merit ($zT$), using the scattering matrix formalism. These results are further supported by calculations based on a lattice-regularized version of the effective Hamiltonian. Additionally, we explore the impact of trigonal warping and valley polarization on the thermoelectric coefficients. Notably, we find a significant variation in $zT$ as a function of these parameters, reaching values as high as 2.5. Interestingly, we observe a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law near the charge neutrality point with the superconducting correlation, indicating that MATBG electrons behave as slow Dirac fermions in this regime. This observation is further confirmed by the damped oscillatory behavior of the thermal conductance as a function of the barrier strength when an insulating barrier is modelled at the interface of the NS junction. Beyond theoretical insights, our findings suggest new possibilities for thermoelectric applications using MATBG based NS junctions.</description>

      <title>A flux-controlled two-site Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In semiconducting-superconducting hybrid devices, Andreev bound states (ABSs) can mediate the coupling between quantum dots (QDs), allowing for the realisation of artificial Kitaev chains. In order to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in these systems, one must control the energy of the ABSs. In this work, we show how extended ABSs in a flux tunable Josephson junction can be used to control the coupling between distant quantum dots separated by $\approx$ 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m. In particular, we demonstrate that the combination of electrostatic control and phase control over the ABSs significantly increases the parameter space in which MBSs are observed. Finally, by employing an additional spectroscopic probe in the hybrid region between the QDs, we gain information about the spatial distribution of the Majorana wave function in a two-site Kitaev chain.</description>

      <title>Colossal orbital-Edelstein effect in non-centrosymmetric superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, the flow of supercurrent can induce a non-vanishing magnetization, a phenomenon which is at the heart of non-dissipative magneto-electric effects, also known as Edelstein effects. For electrons carrying spin and orbital moments a question of fundamental relevance deals with the orbital nature of magneto-electric effects in conventional spin-singlet superconductors with Rashba coupling. Remarkably, we find that the supercurrent-induced orbital magnetization is more than one order of magnitude greater than that due to the spin, giving rise to a colossal magneto-electric effect. The induced orbital magnetization is shown to be sign tunable, with the sign change occurring for the Fermi level lying in proximity of avoiding crossing points in the Brillouin zone. In the presence of superconducting phase inhomogeneities, a modulation of the Edelstein signal on the scale of the superconducting coherence length appears, leading to domains with opposite orbital moment orientations. These hallmarks are robust to real-space self-consistent treatment of the superconducting order parameter. The orbital-dominated magneto-electric phenomena, hence, have clear-cut marks for detection both in the bulk and at the edge of the system and are expected to be a general feature of multi-orbital superconductors with inversion symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Ab initio quantum many-body description of superconducting trends in the cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a systematic ab initio quantum many-body approach that goes beyond low-energy models, we directly compute the superconducting pairing order and estimate the pairing gap of several doped cuprate materials and structures within a purely electronic picture. We find that we can correctly capture two well-known trends: the pressure effect, where the pairing order and gap increase with intra-layer pressure, and the layer effect, where the pairing order and gap vary with the number of copper-oxygen layers. From these calculations, we observe that the strength of superexchange and the covalency at optimal doping are the best descriptors for these trends. Our microscopic analysis further identifies that strong short-range spin fluctuations and multi-orbital charge fluctuations drive the development of the pairing order. Our work illustrates the possibility of a material-specific ab initio understanding of unconventional high-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>A universal phenomenology of charge-spin interconversion and dynamics in diffusive systems with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective field theory for a unified description of transport in normal and superconducting metals in the presence of generic spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The structure of the quantum kinetic theory in the diffusive regime is determined by a set of fundamental constraints -- charge conjugation symmetry, the causality principle, and the crystal symmetry of a material. These symmetries uniquely fix the action of the Keldysh non-linear $\sigma$ model (NLSM), which at the saddle point yields the quantum kinetic Usadel-type equation. Our phenomenological approach is reminiscent of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, but is valid for superconductors in the whole temperature range, describes the diffusive transport in the normal state, and naturally captures the effects of superconducting fluctuations. As an application, we derive the NLSM and quantum transport equations which include all effects of spin-orbit coupling, allowed by the crystal symmetry, for example, the spin Hall, spin current swapping or spin-galvanic effects. Our approach can be extended to systems with broken time reversal symmetry, as well as to the description of hybrid interfaces, where the spin-charge interconversion can be enhanced due to strong interfacial SOC.</description>

      <title>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal-symmetry (TRS), have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying small magnetic field as well as tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% by introducing $\sim1\,\%$ impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The obtained giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originate from the non-local contribution from the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to the dilute impurities.</description>
