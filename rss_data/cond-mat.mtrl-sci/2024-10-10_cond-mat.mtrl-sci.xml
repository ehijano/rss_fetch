      <title>A high-performance nitrogen-rich ZIF-8-derived Fe-Co-NC electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring and developing low-cost, high-performance, and stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is of great importance, though progress is ongoing. In this work, a simple evaporation-pyrolysis method is employed to synthesize 3D porous electrocatalysts, referred to as Fe-Co-NC, which are carbonization products at 900{\deg}C. These catalysts are composed of carbon nanoparticles and metallic FeCo doped nitrogen-enriched carbon nanotubes, produced through the carbonization of pristine ZIF-8, resulting in highly efficient and durable ORR electrocatalysts. The Fe-Co-NC structure exhibits a 3D open porous texture, abundant active sites, favorable nitrogen bonding, and a high specific surface area, all of which contribute to excellent ORR activity. The optimal Fe-Co-NC catalyst demonstrates exceptional ORR performance, with a high onset potential of 0.96 V and a half-wave potential of 0.86 V versus RHE, rivaling the performance of commercially available Pt/C in an alkaline electrolyte. Additionally, the Fe-Co-NC catalyst shows superior stability compared to Pt/C, which is crucial for the development of novel electrocatalysts based on non-precious metals.</description>

      <title>Field-induced antiferromagnetic correlations in a nanopatterned van der Waals ferromagnet: a potential artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-patterned magnetic materials have opened new venues on the investigation of strongly correlated phenomena including artificial spin-ice systems, geometric frustration, magnetic monopoles, for technologically important applications such as reconfigurable ferromagnetism. With the advent of atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets a pertinent question is whether such compounds could make their way into this realm where interactions can be tailored so that unconventional states of matter could be assessed. Here we show that square islands of CrGeTe3 vdW ferromagnets distributed in a grid manifest antiferromagnetic correlations, essential to enable frustration resulting in an artificial spin-ice. By using a combination of SQUID-on-tip microscopy, focused ion beam lithography, and atomistic spin dynamic simulations, we show that pristine, isolated CGT flakes as small as 150*150*60 nm3 have tunable dipole-dipole interactions, which can be precisely controlled by their lateral spacing. There is a crossover between non-interacting islands and significant inter-island anticorrelation depending how they are spatially distributed allowing the creation of complex magnetic patterns not observable at the isolated flakes. Our findings suggest that the cross-talk between the nano-patterned magnets can be explored in the generation of even more complex spin configurations where exotic interactions may be manipulated in an unprecedent way.</description>

      <title>Engineering Interfacial Charge Transfer through Modulation Doping for 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are likely to dominate next-generation electronics due to their advantages in compactness and low power consumption. However, challenges such as high contact resistance and inefficient doping hinder their applicability. Here, we investigate workfunction-mediated charge transfer (modulation doping) as a pathway for achieving high-performance p-type 2D transistors. Focusing on type-III band alignment, we explore the doping capabilities of 27 candidate materials, including transition metal oxides, oxyhalides, and {\alpha}-RuCl3, on channel materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and group-III nitrides. Our extensive first-principles density functional theory (DFT) reveal p-type doping capabilities of high electron affinity materials, including {\alpha}-RuCl3, MoO3, and V2O5. We predict significant reductions in contact resistance and enhanced channel mobility through efficient hole transfer without introducing detrimental defects. We analyze transistor geometries and identify promising material combinations beyond the current focus on WSe2 doping, suggesting new avenues for hBN, AlN, GaN, and MoS2. This comprehensive investigation provides a roadmap for developing high-performance p-type monolayer transistors toward the realization of 2D electronics.</description>

      <title>Towards higher electro-optic response in AlScN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel materials with large electro-optic (EO) coefficients are essential for developing ultra-compact broadband modulators and enabling effective quantum transduction. Compared to lithium niobate, the most widely used nonlinear optical material, wurtzite AlScN offers advantages in nano-photonic devices due to its compatibility with integrated circuits. We perform detailed first-principles calculations to investigate the electro-optic effect in $\mathrm{Al}_{1-x}\mathrm{Sc}_{x}\mathrm{N}$ alloys and superlattices. At elevated Sc concentrations in alloys, the EO coefficients increase; importantly, we find that cation ordering along the $c$ axis leads to enhanced EO response. Strain engineering can be used to further manipulate the EO coefficients of AlScN films. With applied in-plane strains, the piezoelectric contributions to the EO coefficients increase dramatically, even exceeding 251 pm/V. We also explore the possibility of EO enhancement through superlattice engineering, finding that nonpolar $a$-plane $\mathrm{(AlN)}_m/\mathrm{(ScN)}_n$ superlattices increase EO coefficients beyond 40 pm/V. Our findings provide design principles to enhance the electro-optic effect through alloy engineering and heterostructure architecture.</description>

      <title>Understanding and predicting adsorption energetics on monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently been shown to demonstrate non-volatile resistive switching (NVRS), offering significant advantages such as high-density integration and low energy consumption due to their atomic-scale thinness. In this study, we focus on the adsorption and desorption of metal adatoms, which can modulate the electrical resistivity by several orders of magnitude. We develop material-based relationships of the adsorption energy with electronic and atomic structure descriptors by examining the effects of various transition-metal adsorbates on the surface of TMDs. Our results reveal that adsorption energies of transition metals exhibit consistent trends across different TMDs (MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$) and can be explained using simple descriptors of the atomic and electronic structure. We propose several models to describe this adsorption process, providing a deeper understanding of a crucial step in the resistive switching mechanism based on formation and dissolution of point defects. Finally, we connect our computed adsorption energies to the switching energy. These findings will help guide rational materials selection for the development of NVRS devices using 2D TMDs.</description>

Abstract: Evidence of chirality was observed at the Fe metal center in Fe(III) spin crossover coordination salts [Fe(qsal)2][ Ni(dmit)2] and [Fe(qsal)2](TCNQ)2 from X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Fe 2p3/2 core threshold. This indicates the formation of chiral domains that influence the octahedral coordination on the Fe core.</description>

      <title>Formalism to Image the Dynamics of Coherent and Incoherent Phonon with Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy using Kinematic Diffraction Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) is a novel X-ray imaging technique developed at synchrotrons to image along the diffracted beam with a real space resolution of ~100 nm and reciprocal space resolution of $10^{-4}$. Recent implementations of DFXM at X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) have demonstrated DFXM's ability to visualize the real-time evolution of coherent GHz phonons produced by ultrafast laser excitation of metal transducers. Combining this with DFXM's ability to visualize strain fields due to dislocations makes it possible to study the interaction of GHz coherent phonons with the strain fields of dislocations, along with studying the damping of coherent phonons due to interactions with thermal phonons. For quantitative analysis of phonon-dislocation interactions and phonon damping, a formalism is required to relate phonon dynamics to the strains measured by DFXM. In this work, we use kinematic diffraction theory to simulate DFXM images of the specific coherent phonons in diamond that are generated by the ultrafast laser excitation of a metal transducer. We extend this formalism to also describe imaging of incoherent phonons of sufficiently high frequency, which are relevant for thermal transport, offering future opportunities for DFXM to image signals produced by thermal diffuse scattering. For both coherent and incoherent phonons, we discuss the optimal sampling of real space, reciprocal space and time, and the opportunities offered by the advances in DFXM optics.</description>

      <title>Tight-binding model of Pt-based jacutingaites as combination of the honeycomb and kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a refined tight-binding (TB) model for Pt-based jacutingaite materials Pt$_{2}N$X$_{3}$, ($N$ = Zn, Cd, Hg; X = S, Se, Te), offering a detailed representation of the low-energy physics of its monolayers. This model incorporates all elements with significant spin-orbit coupling contributions, which are essential for understanding the topological energy gaps in these materials. Through comparison with first-principles calculations, we meticulously fitted the TB parameters, ensuring an accurate depiction of the energy bands near the Fermi level. Our model reveals the intricate interplay between the Pt $3e$ and $N$ metal orbitals, forming distinct kagome and honeycomb lattice structures. Applying this model, we explore the edge states of Pt-based jacutingaite monolayer nanoribbons, highlighting the sensitivity of the topological edge states dispersion bands to the nanostructures geometric configurations. These insights not only deepen our understanding of jacutingaite materials but also assist in tailoring their electronic properties for future applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Molecular Clusters with Dual-Scale Equivariant Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous molecular solids offer a promising alternative to inorganic semiconductors, owing to their mechanical flexibility and solution processability. The packing structure of these materials plays a crucial role in determining their electronic and transport properties, which are key to enhancing the efficiency of devices like organic solar cells (OSCs). However, obtaining these optoelectronic properties computationally requires molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate a conformational ensemble, a process that can be computationally expensive due to the large system sizes involved. Recent advances have focused on using generative models, particularly flow-based models as Boltzmann generators, to improve the efficiency of MD sampling. In this work, we developed a dual-scale flow matching method that separates training and inference into coarse-grained and all-atom stages and enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of standard flow matching samplers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a dataset of Y6 molecular clusters obtained through MD simulations, and we benchmark its efficiency and accuracy against single-scale flow matching methods.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress on Multiferroic Hexagonal Rare-Earth Ferrites (h-RFeO3, R = Y,Dy-Lu)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiferroic hexagonal rare-earth ferrites (h-RFeO3, R=Sc, Y, and rare earth), in which the improper ferroelectricity and canted antiferromagnetism coexist, have been advocated as promising candidates to pursue the room-temperature multiferroics, because of strong spin-spin interaction. The strong interactions between the ferroic orders and the structural distortions are appealing for high-density, energy-efficient electronic devices. Over the past decade, remarkable advances in atomic-scale synthesis, characterization, and material modeling enable the significant progresses in the understanding and manipulation of ferroic orders and their couplings in h-RFeO3 thin films. These results reveal a physical picture of rich ferroelectric and magnetic phenomena interconnected by a set of structural distortions and spin-lattice couplings, which provides guidance for the control of ferroic orders down to the nano scale and the discovery of novel physical phenomena. This review focus on state-of-the-art studies in complex phenomena related to the ferroelectricity and magnetism as well as the magnetoelectric couplings in multiferroic h-RFeO3, based on mostly the recent experimental efforts, aiming to stimulate fresh ideas in this field.</description>

      <title>Tunable second harmonic generation in 2D materials: comparison of different strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical frequency conversion, where optical fields interact with a nonlinear medium to generate new frequencies, is a key phenomenon in modern photonic systems. However, a major challenge with these techniques lies on the difficulty of tuning the nonlinear electrical susceptibilities that drive such effects in a given material. As a result, dynamic control of optical nonlinearities has remained largely confined to research laboratories, limiting its practical use as a spectroscopic tool. In this work, we aim to advance the development of devices with tunable nonlinear responses by exploring two potential mechanisms for electrically manipulating second-order optical nonlinearity in two-dimensional materials. Specifically, we consider two configurations: in the first, the material does not inherently exhibit second-harmonic generation (SHG), but this response is induced by an external field; in the second, an external field induces doping in a material that already exhibits SHG, altering the intensity of the nonlinear signal. These two approaches are investigated and compared with existing experimental results.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Magnetic Suppression in Heusler Alloy IrMnAl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study conducts a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the IrMnAl Heusler alloy, highlighting its magnetic properties and assessing the effects of pressure-induced phase shift. The limitations of Generalized Gradient Approximation in accurately representing the compounds magnetic behavior is addressed by employing the GGA+U approach, which more effectively captures the electronic features. At 5.6 GPa pressure, we observe a novel structural phase transition from the cubic F4-3m to the P4-3m space group. The calculated Curie temperature, combined with the analysis of Mn-Mn exchange interaction, sheds light on the weak ferromagnetism observed in the new phase of the compound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesa- and trench-patterned surfaces of 4H-SiC(0001) 4{\textdegree}off wafers were structured in macrosteps using Si melting in a SiC-Si-SiC sandwich configuration. Si spreading difficulties were observed in the case of trench-patterned samples while the attempts on mesa-patterned ones were more successful. In the latter case, parallel macrosteps were formed on both the dry-etched and unetched areas though these macrosteps rarely cross the patterns edges. The proposed mechanism involved preferential etching at Si-C bilayer step edges and fast lateral propagation along the [1120] direction.</description>

      <title>Polarity Effect on the Heteroepitaxial Growth of BxC on 4H-SiC by CVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth of boron carbide (B x C) layers on 4H-SiC, 4{\textdegree}off substrates was studied. Depending on the polarity of the substrate, different results were obtained. On Si face, the direct CVD growth at 1600{\textdegree}C under a mixture of BCl 3 +C 3 H 8 systematically led to polycrystalline B x C films, whatever the C/B ratio in the gas phase. On the C face, heteroepitaxial growth was obtained for C/B ratios = 12 or higher with a step bunched morphology. If a boridation step (10 min at 1200{\textdegree}C under BCl 3 flow) was used before the CVD growth, then heteroepitaxy was successful on both substrate polarities. To explain these results, a mechanism is proposed which involves the nature of the chemical bonds at the early stage of nucleation. It is suggested that a full B coverage of the SiC surface should favor the nucleation of the B-rich (0001) plane of B x C, promoting thus the heteroepitaxial growth along this direction.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen diffusion in garnet: insights from atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Garnet has been widely used to decipher the pressure-temperature-time history of rocks, but its physical properties such as elasticity and diffusion are strongly affected by trace amounts of hydrogen. Experimental measurements of H diffusion in garnet are limited to room pressure. We use atomistic simulations to study H diffusion in perfect and defective garnet lattices, focusing on protonation defects at the Si and Mg sites, which are shown to be energetically favored. The ab-initio simulation of H diffusion is computationally challenging due to a transient trapping of H, which is overcome with machine learning techniques by training a deep neural network that encodes the interatomic potential. Our results show high mobility of hydrogen in defect free garnet lattices, whereas H diffusivity is significantly diminished in defective lattices. Tracer simulation focusing on H alone highlights the vital role of atomic vibrations of heavier atoms like Mg in the untrapping of H atoms. Two regimes of H diffusion are identified: a diffuser-dominated regime at high hydrogen content with low activation energies, due to saturation of vacancies by hydrogen, and a vacancy-dominated regime at low hydrogen content with high activation energies, due to trapping of H atoms at vacancy sites. These regimes account for experimental observations, such as a H-concentration dependent diffusivity and the discrepancy in activation energy between deprotonation and D-H exchange experiments. This study underpins the crucial role of vacancies in H diffusion and demonstrates the utility of machine-learned interatomic potentials in studying kinetic processes in the Earth's interior.</description>

      <title>$^{27}$Al NMR spectroscopic and DFT computational study of the quadrupole coupling of aluminium in two polymorphs of the complex aluminium hydride CsAlH4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadrupole coupling constant $C_{\text{Q}}$ and the asymmetry parameter $\eta$ of the aluminium nuclei in two polymorphs of the complex aluminium hydride CsAlH4 are determined from both $^{27}$Al MAS NMR spectra and $^{27}$Al NMR spectra recorded for stationary samples by using the Solomon echo sequence. The accuracy with which these parameters can be determined from the static spectra (CsAlH4(o): $C_{\text{Q}}=(1.42\pm0.01)$ MHz, $\eta=(0.62\pm0.01)$ and CsAlH4(t): $C_{\text{Q}}=(1.43\pm0.02)$ MHz, $\eta&lt;0.03$) seems to be slightly higher than via the MAS approach. The experimentally determined parameters ($\delta_{\text{iso}}$, $C_{\text{Q}}$ and $\eta$) are compared with those obtained from DFT-GIPAW (density functional theory - gauge-including projected augmented wave) calculations. When using DFT-optimized structures, the magnitude of the quadrupole coupling constant is overestimated by about 45% for both polymorphs. Further calculations in which the geometry of the AlH4 tetrahedra was varied show a high sensitivity of $C_{\text{Q}}$ on the H--Al--H angles in particular. Modest changes in the angles on the order of one to three degrees are sufficient to achieve near-perfect agreement between GIPAW calculations and experiment. The deviations found for the DFT-optimized structures are explained with the neglect of thermal motion, which typically leads to a reduction of distortions of the AlH4 tetrahedra. From a broader perspective, the uncertainty in the positions of the hydrogen atoms renders the accurate reproduction or prediction of quadrupole coupling constants for aluminium hydrides challenging.</description>

      <title>Decoupled charge and heat transport for high-performance Fe$_2$VAl composite thermoelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoupling charge and heat transport is essential for optimizing thermoelectric materials. Strategies to inhibit lattice-driven heat transport, however, also compromise carrier mobility, limiting the performance of most thermoelectrics, including Fe$_2$VAl Heusler compounds. Here, we demonstrate an innovative approach, which bypasses this tradeoff: via liquid-phase sintering, we incorporate the archetypal topological insulator Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_{x}$ between Fe$_2$V$_{0.95}$Ta$_{0.1}$Al$_{0.95}$ grains. Structural investigations alongside extensive thermoelectric and magneto-transport measurements reveal distinct modifications in the microstructure, and a reduced lattice thermal conductivity and enhanced carrier mobility are simultaneously found. This yields a huge performance boost $-$ far beyond the effective-medium limit $-$ and results in one of the highest figure of merits among both half- and full-Heusler compounds, $z\approx 1.6\times 10^{-3}\,$K$^{-1}$ ($zT\approx 0.5$) at 295 K. Our findings highlight the potential of secondary phases to decouple charge and heat transport and call for more advanced theoretical studies of multiphase composites.</description>

      <title>Porous carbon nitride fullerenes: a novel family of porous cage molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study theoretically a novel family of cage molecules, the porous carbon nitride fullerenes (PCNFs), which can be considered the zero-dimensional counterparts of the two-dimensional porous graphitic carbon nitrides, in accordance with icosahedral fullerenes, representing the zero-dimensional counterpart of graphene. We focus on two representative members of the PCNF family, the icosahedral C$_{60}$N$_{60}$ and C$_{120}$N$_{60}$ which are the first members of the two main sub-families of these structures derived from the class I and II Goldberg polyhedra, respectively. Taking into account that the two-dimensional graphitic carbon nitrides are considered the next-generation materials for several interesting applications, the interest in their zero-dimension counterparts is obvious. In the present study, we utilize Density Functional Theory to find their structural, vibrational, and electronic properties. The stability of the proposed cages was demonstrated through vibrational analysis and molecular dynamics simulations with ReaxFF potentials. Regarding thermal stability, we found that C$_{60}$N$_{60}$ could be stable well above 1000 K and C$_{120}$N$_{60}$ well above 2000 K. Finally, we discuss several ideas regarding precursors that could be possibly used for their bottom-up synthesis.</description>

      <title>Modifying deformation behaviour of Body-Centred Cubic lattices from bending to stretch via twinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BCC lattices with twinned meta-crystal architecture inspired by strengthening of bulk metals have significantly improved mechanical performance; however, their deformation behaviour and underlying strengthening mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we reveal that twinning causes a transition from bending to stretch-dominated behaviour in BCC lattices, violating the Gibson-Ashby model, and eliciting vast improvements in stiffness (+181%) and strength (+128%). By controlling a heterogenous distribution of twinned grain boundaries, inspired by bimodal harmonic microstructure, we amplify the axial strain energy at location specific sites, further enhancing the stiffness of twinned BCC lattices by 11.1%. Our lattice design philosophy unleashes the potential of cellular materials for high-performance engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous Nucleation of Undercooled Al-Ni melts via a Machine-Learned Interaction Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneous nucleation processes are important for understanding solidification and the resulting microstructure of materials. Simulating this process requires accurately describing the interactions between atoms, hich is further complicated by chemical order through cross-species interactions. The large scales needed to observe rare nucleation events are far beyond the capabilities of ab initio simulations. Machine-learning is used for overcoming these limitations in terms of both accuracy and speed, by building a high-dimensional neural network potential for binary Al-Ni alloys, which serve as a model system relevant to many industrial applications. The potential is validated against experimental diffusion, viscosity, and scattering data, and is applied to large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of homogeneous nucleation at equiatomic composition, as well as for pure Ni. Pure Ni nucleates in a single-step into an fcc crystal phase, in contrast to previous results obtained with a classical empirical potential. This highlights the sensitivity of nucleation pathways to the underlying atomic interactions. Our findings suggest that the nucleation pathway for AlNi proceeds in a single step toward a B2 structure, which is discussed in relation to the pure elements counterparts.</description>

      <title>High-Spin State Dynamics and Quintet-Mediated Emission in Intramolecular Singlet Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spin states in molecular systems hold significant interest for a wide range of applications ranging from optoelectronics to quantum information and singlet fission (SF). Quintet and triplet states play crucial roles, particularly in SF systems, necessitating a precise monitoring and control of their spin dynamics. Spin states in intramolecular SF (iSF) are of particular interest, but tuning these systems to control triplet multiplication pathways has not been extensively studied. Additionally, whilst studies in this context focus on participation of triplet pathways leading to photoluminescence, emission pathways via quintet states remain largely unexplored. Here, we employ a set of unique spin-sensitive techniques to investigate high-spin state formation and emission in dimers and trimers comprising multiple diphenylhexatriene (DPH) units. We demonstrate the formation of pure quintet states in all these oligomers, with optical emission via quintet states dominating delayed fluorescence up to room temperature. For triplet formation, we distinguish between SF and ISC pathways, identifying the trimer Me-(DPH)$_3$ as the only oligomer exhibiting exclusively the desired SF pathways. Conversely, linear (DPH)$_3$ and (DPH)$_2$ show additional or exclusive triplet pathways via ISC. Our comprehensive analysis provides a detailed investigation into high-spin state formation, control, and emission in intramolecular singlet fission systems.</description>

      <title>Deconstructing equivariant representations in molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent equivariant models have shown significant progress in not just chemical property prediction, but as surrogates for dynamical simulations of molecules and materials. Many of the top performing models in this category are built within the framework of tensor products, which preserves equivariance by restricting interactions and transformations to those that are allowed by symmetry selection rules. Despite being a core part of the modeling process, there has not yet been much attention into understanding what information persists in these equivariant representations, and their general behavior outside of benchmark metrics. In this work, we report on a set of experiments using a simple equivariant graph convolution model on the QM9 dataset, focusing on correlating quantitative performance with the resulting molecular graph embeddings. Our key finding is that, for a scalar prediction task, many of the irreducible representations are simply ignored during training -- specifically those pertaining to vector ($l=1$) and tensor quantities ($l=2$) -- an issue that does not necessarily make itself evident in the test metric. We empirically show that removing some unused orders of spherical harmonics improves model performance, correlating with improved latent space structure. We provide a number of recommendations for future experiments to try and improve efficiency and utilization of equivariant features based on these observations.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Phase-Field Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-field methods offer a versatile computational framework for simulating large-scale microstructure evolution. However, the applicability and predictability of phase-field models are inherently limited by their ad hoc nature, and there is currently no bottom-up theory available that enables truly first-principles predictive modeling of large-scale non-equilibrium processes. Here, we present a bottom-up framework that provides a route to the construction of mesoscopic phase-field models entirely based on atomistic information. By introducing a molecular coarse-grained system as an intermediate step, we demonstrate the approach on the example of ice nucleation dynamics, with a spatiotemporal scale-up of nearly $10^8$ times compared to the microscopic model. Our framework offers a unique approach for incorporating atomistic details into mesoscopic models, systematically bridging the gap between microscopic particle-based simulations and field-theoretic models.</description>

      <title>A Substructure Perturbation Method for Systematic Design of Mechanical Metamaterials with Programmed Functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials utilize geometry to achieve exceptional mechanical properties, including those not typically possible for traditional materials. To achieve these properties, it is necessary to identify the proper structures and geometries, which is often a non-trivial and computationally expensive process. Here, we propose a Substructure Perturbation Method (SSPM) for systematic design and search of these materials with programmed deformation modes. We present the theoretical fundamentals and computational algorithms of the SSPM, along with four design problems to investigate the effect and performance of the SSPM. Results reveal the necessity of analyzing multiple substructures simultaneously in obtaining successful designs, and its effectiveness in speeding up numerical processes. In one design case, SSPM is shown to be effectively two orders of magnitude faster than another state-of-art approach while using less computational resources. We also show an experimental validation where the fabricated prototypes can grasp objects respectively by undergoing programmed deformations under corresponding inputs. The proposed SSPM provides new fundamentals and strategies for the design of mechanical metamaterials with advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Saliva-Sensing Dental Floss: A Novel Tool for Assessing Daily Stress via On-Demand Salivary Cortisol Measurement Integrating Molecularly Imprinted Polymer and Thread Microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elevated stress negatively impacts health, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, weak immunity, anxiety, and cognitive decline. Current lab-based methods lack real-time stress measurement, while saliva diagnostics offers a convenient and non-invasive alternative. This work proposes repurposing dental floss as a thread-analytical saliva diagnostic device. This method uses flossing to collect and transport saliva to a flexible electrochemical sensor via capillary microfluidics, where cortisol, a stress biomarker, is measured. By integrating an electropolymerized molecularly imprinted polymer specific to cortisol (cort-eMIP) on a porous-laser-engraved-graphene (PLEG) working electrode, the saliva-floss platform shows a detection range of 0.10-10000 pg mL-1 (R2 = 0.9916) with a detection limit of 0.023 pg mL-1 for cortisol (in buffer medium). The saliva-sensing dental floss provides results within 5 minutes. The thread-based microfluidic design minimizes interference and ensures consistent repeatability when testing artificial and actual human saliva samples, yielding 98.64 to 102.4 percent recoveries with a relative standard deviation of 5.01%, demonstrating high accuracy and precision. Validated using human saliva samples in a stress study, it showed a high correlation (r= 0.9910) with conventional ELISA assays. Combined with a wireless readout, this saliva floss offers a convenient way to monitor daily stress levels and can be extended to detect other critical salivary biomarkers.</description>

      <title>RIXS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the excitation spectra of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer spin chain by employing a combination of numerical and theoretical techniques. Utilizing the Krylov-space correction-vector method in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), we calculate both the direct and indirect resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra for the trimer spin chain. To interpret the observed features in the RIXS spectra, we perform a theoretical perturbative analysis to compute the energy dispersions which are then utilized to determine the density of states (DOS) for both the single-particle and the two-particle excitation spectra. Our results show that the single-particle continua of the direct RIXS spectrum align with the energy levels observed in the DOS spectra of spinon, doublon, and quarton excitations. Furthermore, the two-particle continua are revealed in the indirect RIXS process, where all possible single particle excitations combine to form the various two-particle excitations of the trimer spin chain. Based on our calculations, we propose the RIXS mechanism of generating the fractionalized (spinon) and collective (doublon and quarton) excitations in the trimer spin chain at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge, including discussing the interplay of these excitations in the RIXS spectrum for various trimer coupling strength. The computed energy range of the excitations suggest the possibility of experimental detection at both the $L$-edge and the $K$-edge within the current capabilities of RIXS instrumentation resolution.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic relations for the Cooper pair's momentum in helical superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two thermodynamic relations are proposed for the exact measurement of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the Cooper pairs in helical superconductors. The first relation concerns the constraint on the change in the COM momentum in response to the variation in the magnetic field, which is linked to the superconducting Edelstein effect. The second relation is related to a first-order phase transition, showing that the jump of the COM momentum can be measured from the slope of the transition line on the phase diagram, where the supercurrent is used as a control parameter.

      <title>Curved graphene nanoribbons derived from tetrahydropyrene-based polyphenylenes via one-pot K-region oxidation and Scholl cyclization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is of great interest to chemists and materials scientists because of their unique opto-electronic properties and potential applications in carbon-based nanoelectronics and spintronics. In addition to the tunable edge structure and width, introducing curvature in GNRs is a powerful structural feature for their chemi-physical property modification. Here, we report an efficient solution synthesis of the first pyrene-based GNR (PyGNR) with curved geometry via one-pot K-region oxidation and Scholl cyclization of its corresponding well-soluble tetrahydropyrene-based polyphenylene precursor. The efficient A2B2-type Suzuki polymerization and subsequent Scholl reaction furnishes up to 35 nm long curved GNRs bearing cove- and armchair-edges. The construction of model compound, as a cutout of PyGNR, from a tetrahydropyrene-based oligophenylene precursor proves the concept and efficiency of the one-pot K-region oxidation and Scholl cyclization, which is clearly revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structure and optical properties of PyGNR are investigated by Raman, FT-IR, solid-state NMR and UV-Vis analysis with the support of DFT calculations. PyGNR shows the absorption maximum at 680 nm, exhibiting a narrow optical bandgap of 1.4 eV, qualifying as a low-bandgap GNR. Moreover, THz spectroscopy on PyGNR estimates its macroscopic charge mobility of 3.6 cm2/Vs, outperforming other curved GNRs reported via conventional Scholl reaction.</description>

      <title>Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color laser driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we unifiedly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense laser (non-perturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the spatial symmetry of the laser-field trajectory. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zero-th order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift or injection current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multiple-color laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Physico-thermal and geochemical behavior and alteration of the Au indicator gangue hydrothermal quartz at the Kubi Gold Ore Deposits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altered and gangue quartz in hydrothermal veins from the Kubi Gold deposit in Dunkwa on Offin in the central region of Ghana are investigated for possible Au-associated indicator minerals and to provide the understanding and increase the knowledge of the mineral hosting and alteration processes in quartz. X-ray diffraction, air annealing furnace, differential scanning calorimetry, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy have been applied on different quartz types outcropping from surface and bedrocks at the Kubi Gold Mining to reveal the material properties at different temperatures. From the diffraction results of the fresh and annealed quartz samples, we find that the samples contain indicator and the impurity minerals iron disulfide, biotite, titanium oxide, and magnetite. These minerals, under oxidation process between 574-1400 {\deg}C temperatures experienced hematite alterations and a transformation from {\alpha}-quartz to \b{eta}-quartz and further to cristobalite as observed from the calorimetry scans for hydrothermally exposed materials. The energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed elemental components of Fe, S, Mg, K, Al, Ti, Na, Si, O, and Ca contained in the samples, and these are attributed to the impurity phase minerals observed in the diffraction. The findings also suggest that during the hydrothermal flow regime, impurity minerals and metals can be trapped by voids and faults. Under favorable temperature conditions, the trapped minerals can be altered to change color at different depositional stages by oxidation and reduction processes leading to hematite alteration which is a useful indicator mineral in mineral exploration.</description>

      <title>Probing nonlinear spin dynamics in canted easy-plane antiferromagnets using spin-rectification effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-rectification phenomena in canted antiferromagnets, closely connected to the family of altermagnetic materials. Our results show that excitation efficiency is significantly enhanced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Antiferromagnetic dynamics can be detected through spin-Hall magnetoresistance and bolometric effects, with an efficiency reaching up to mV/W. The rectified voltage shape is influenced by both the symmetry of the exciting torques, detection mechanisms (continuous spin-pumping and spin-Hall magnetoresistance), and the antiferromagnetic crystalline axis. Under high pumping power, we observe a saturation effect related to Suhl-like spin-wave instabilities and a nonlinear redshift of the antiferromagnetic resonance. These findings open new avenues for studying nonlinear dynamics in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Specific Iron Binding to Natural Sphingomyelin Membrane Induced by Non-Specific Co-Solutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis: Sphingomyelin (SPM), a crucial phospholipid in the myelin sheath, is vital in insulating nerve fibers. We hypothesize that iron ions selectively bind to the phosphatidylcholine (PC) template within the SPM membrane under near-physiological conditions, disrupting membrane organization. These interactions could potentially contribute to the degradation of the myelin sheath, thereby playing a role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Experiments: We utilized synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopy and diffraction techniques to study the interaction of iron ions with a bovine spinal cord SPM monolayer (ML) at the liquid-vapor interface under physiological conditions. The SPM ML serves as a model system, representing localized patches of lipids within a more complex membrane structure. The experiments assessed iron binding to the SPM membrane both in the presence of salts and with additional evaluation of the effects of various ion species on membrane behavior. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction was employed to analyze the impact of iron binding on the structural integrity of the SPM membrane. Findings: Our results demonstrate that iron ions in dilute solution selectively bind to the PC template of the SPM membrane exclusively at near-physiological salt concentrations (e.g., NaCl, KCl, KI, or CaCl2) and are pH-dependent. In-significant binding was detected without these salts or at near-neutral pH with salts. The surface adsorption of iron ions is correlated with salt concentration, reaching saturation at physiological levels. In contrast, multivalent ions such as La$^{3+}$ and Ca2+ do not bind to SPM under similar conditions. Notably, iron binding to the SPM membrane disrupts its in-plane organization, suggesting that these interactions may compromise membrane integrity and contribute to myelin sheath damage associated with neurological disorders.</description>

      <title>Considerations for Electromagnetic Simulations for a Quantitative Correlation of Optical Spectroscopy and Electron Tomography of Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical cross sections of plasmonic nanoparticles are intricately linked to the morphology of the particle. If this connection can be made accurately enough, it would become possible to determine a particles shape solely from its measured optical cross sections. For that, electromagnetic simulations can be used to bridge the morphology and optical properties assuming that they can be performed in an accurate manner. In this paper, we study key factors that influence the accuracy of electromagnetic simulations. First, we compare several standard electromagnetic simulation methods and discuss in detail the effects of the meshing accuracy, choice of dielectric function and inclusion of a substrate for the boundary element method. To help the boundary element methods complex parametrization, we develop a workflow including reconstruction, meshing and mesh simplification steps to be able to use electron tomography data as input for these simulations. In particular, we analyze how the choice of reconstruction algorithm and the intricacies of image segmentation influence the simulated optical cross sections and correlate it to induced shape errors, which can be minimized in the data processing pipeline. In our case, optimal results could be obtained by using the Total Variation Minimization (TVM) reconstruction method in combination with Otsu thresholding and slight smoothing, which was important to create a reliable and watertight surface mesh using the marching cubes algorithm, especially for more complex shapes.</description>

      <title>On criticality of interface depinning and origin of "bump" in the avalanche distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The depinning transition critical point is manifested as power-law distributed avalanches exhibited by slowly driven elastic interfaces in quenched random media. Here we show that since avalanches with different starting heights relative to the mean interface height or different initial local interface curvatures experience different excess driving forces due to elasticity, avalanches close to the "global" critical point of non-mean field systems can be separated into populations of subcritical, critical and supercritical ones. The asymmetric interface height distribution results in an excess of supercritical avalanches, manifested as a "bump" in the avalanche size distribution cutoff.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between orbital moment anisotropy, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in W/Co/Pt trilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the Co layer thickness dependences of magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and orbital moment anisotropy (OMA) in W/Co/Pt trilayers, in order to clarify their correlations with each other. We find that the MCA favors magnetization along the film normal and monotonically increases with decreasing effective magnetic layer thickness ($t_\mathrm{eff}$). The magnitude of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange constant ($|D|$) increases with decreasing $t_\mathrm{eff}$ until $t_\mathrm{eff} \sim$1 nm, below which $|D|$ decreases. The MCA and $|D|$ scale with $1/t_\mathrm{eff}$ for $t_\mathrm{eff}$ larger than $\sim$1 nm, indicating an interfacial origin. The increase of MCA with decreasing $t_\mathrm{eff}$ continues below $t_\mathrm{eff}$ $\sim$ 1 nm, but with a slower rate. To clarify the cause of the $t_\mathrm{eff}$ dependences of MCA and DMI, the OMA of Co in W/Co/Pt trilayers is studied using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). We find non-zero OMA when $t_\mathrm{eff}$ is smaller than $\sim$0.8 nm. The OMA increases with decreasing $t_\mathrm{eff}$ more rapidly than what is expected from the MCA, indicating that factors other than OMA contribute to the MCA at small $t_\mathrm{eff}$. The $t_\mathrm{eff}$ dependence of the OMA also suggests that $|D|$ at $t_\mathrm{eff}$ smaller than $\sim$1 nm is not related to the OMA at the interface. We propose that the growth of Co on W results in a strain and/or texture that reduces the interfacial DMI, and, to some extent, MCA at small $t_\mathrm{eff}$.</description>

      <title>Exciton dissociation in two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides: Excited states and substrate effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.02574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exciton dissociation plays a crucial role in the performance of optoelectronic devices based on two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In this work, we investigate the effect of an in-plane electric field on the exciton resonance states in MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) monolayers and few-layers using the complex coordinate rotation method and the Lagrange-Laguerre polynomial expansion of the wave function. The exciton properties are well described within the Mott-Wannier model incorporating the nonlocal Keldysh potential. Our calculations reveal that an electric field effectively dissociates excitons, with excited states being more easily dissociated than the ground state. The critical field for exciton dissociation is found to be smaller in WX$_2$ monolayers compared to MoX$_2$ monolayers due to the smaller exciton reduced mass. Furthermore, the presence of a dielectric substrate and an increase in the number of MX$_2$ layers enhance the exciton susceptibility to the electric field, lowering the critical field for dissociation. The dependence of exciton properties on the number of MX$_2$ layers can be well described by power functions. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of high-performance optoelectronic devices based on 2D TMDs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological magnons have garnered significant interest for their potential in both fundamental research and device applications, owing to their exotic, uncharged, yet topologically protected boundary modes. However, their comprehension has been hindered by the absence of fundamental symmetry descriptions of magnetic materials, which are primarily governed by isotropic Heisenberg interactions in spin Hamiltonians. The ensuing magnon dispersions enable gapless magnon band nodes that go beyond the scenario of representation theory of the magnetic space groups (MSGs), thus referred to as unconventional magnons. Here we developed spin space group (SSG) theory to elucidate collinear magnetic configurations, classifying the 1421 collinear SSGs into four types, constructing their band representations, and providing a comprehensive tabulation of unconventional magnons, such as duodecuple points, octuple nodal lines, and charge-4 octuple points. Based on the MAGNDATA database, we identified 498 collinear magnets with unconventional magnons, among which over 200 magnon band structures were obtained by using first-principles calculations and linear spin wave theory. Additionally, we evaluated the influence of the spin-orbit coupling-induced exchange interaction in these magnets and found that more than 80% are predominantly governed by the Heisenberg interactions, indicating that SSG serves as an ideal framework for describing magnon band nodes in most 3d, 4d and half-filled 4f collinear magnets. Our work offers new pathways for exploring uncharged transports in magnonic systems, holding promise for advancements in next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall effect in non-magnetic Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an investigation of the phonon thermal Hall effect in single crystal samples of Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$. We measured the field-linear thermal Hall effect in all three samples. The temperature dependence of thermal Hall conductivities shows a peak around 15 K, which coincides with the peak positions of the longitudinal thermal conductivities. The temperature-dependent longitudinal thermal conductivities indicates that phonons dominate thermal transport in all three samples. However, the presence of Dy$^{3+}$ magnetic ions introduces significant effects on the field dependence of longitudinal thermal conductivities. The thermal Hall ratio is sizeable in all three samples and consistent with the values reported for other insulating materials exhibiting a phononic thermal Hall effect, though their exact underlying mechanism remains yet to be identified. The thermal Hall ratio is nearly the same for $\rm Y_2Ti_2O_7$ and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$, and slightly larger for Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, suggesting that magnetic impurities are less significant in generating the phononic thermal Hall effect. Our observations of the phononic thermal Hall effect support an intrinsic origin in Y$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, but suggest a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic effects in Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ and DyYTi$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the fast developments of high-performance computing, first-principles methods based on quantum mechanics play a significant role in materials research, serving as fundamental tools for predicting and analyzing various properties of materials. However, the inherent complexity and substantial computational demands of first-principles algorithms, such as density functional theory, limit their use in larger systems. The rapid development of heterogeneous computing, particularly General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs), has heralded new prospects for enhancing the performance and cost-effectiveness of first-principles algorithms. We utilize GPGPUs to accelerate the electronic structure algorithms in Atomic-orbital Based Ab-initio Computation at USTC (ABACUS), a first-principles computational package based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set. We design algorithms on GPGPU to efficiently construct and diagonalize the Hamiltonian of a given system, including the related force and stress calculations. The effectiveness of this computational acceleration has been demonstrated through calculations on twisted bilayer graphene with the system size up to 10,444 atoms.</description>

Abstract: Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However, LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data (such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli, electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models.

      <title>Tantalum electrodeposition using a nanoporous anodic alumina template and a nanostructured gold/nickel-chromium glass-ceramic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrodeposition of tantalum coating was performed from an ionic liquid, BMP[Tf2N], in the presence of dissolved anhydrous TaF5 and LiF. Superficial X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supplemented by an argon ion etching and depth profiling has proven the presence of the tantalum metal inside a thin coating deposited via a porous anodic alumina template. Additionally, tantalum electrodeposition was attempted using a planar sputter-deposited gold coating on a glass-ceramic substrate as the working electrode. Pores emerged within the sputter-deposited gold layer after the Ta electrodeposition step. Nano- to submicrometer large pores were created due to aluminum impurity diffusion through the gold and consequent etching effect of fluorides in the ionic liquid solution. Nanostructured tantalum and nanoporous gold are attractive materials with potential applications in high-performance electronic devices, including sensors, electrocatalysis, and energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Stability-Aware Training of Machine Learning Force Fields with Differentiable Boltzmann Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are an attractive alternative to ab-initio methods for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, they can produce unstable simulations, limiting their ability to model phenomena occurring over longer timescales and compromising the quality of estimated observables. To address these challenges, we present Stability-Aware Boltzmann Estimator (StABlE) Training, a multi-modal training procedure which leverages joint supervision from reference quantum-mechanical calculations and system observables. StABlE Training iteratively runs many MD simulations in parallel to seek out unstable regions, and corrects the instabilities via supervision with a reference observable. We achieve efficient end-to-end automatic differentiation through MD simulations using our Boltzmann Estimator, a generalization of implicit differentiation techniques to a broader class of stochastic algorithms. Unlike existing techniques based on active learning, our approach requires no additional ab-initio energy and forces calculations to correct instabilities. We demonstrate our methodology across organic molecules, tetrapeptides, and condensed phase systems, using three modern MLFF architectures. StABlE-trained models achieve significant improvements in simulation stability, data efficiency, and agreement with reference observables. By incorporating observables into the training process alongside first-principles calculations, StABlE Training can be viewed as a general semi-empirical framework applicable across MLFF architectures and systems. This makes it a powerful tool for training stable and accurate MLFFs, particularly in the absence of large reference datasets.</description>

      <title>Polycatenated Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architected materials derive their properties from the geometric arrangement of their internal structural elements. Their designs rely on continuous networks of members to control the global mechanical behavior of the bulk. Here, we introduce a class of materials that consist of discrete concatenated rings or cage particles interlocked in three-dimensional networks, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general design framework that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particles' concatenations and geometries. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses. At larger strains, PAMs behave like lattices and foams, with a nonlinear stress-strain relation. At microscale, we demonstrate that PAMs can change their shapes in response to applied electrostatic charges. PAM's unique properties pave the path for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems and morphing architectures.</description>

Abstract: In theory, two extreme forms of substances exist:the pure form and the single-molecule mixture form. The latter contains a mixture of molecules with molecularly different structures.Inspired by the "chemical space"concept, I recently reported a study of the single-molecule mixture state that combines model construction and mathematical analysis,obtaining some interesting results.(Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024,25,7571.) In this preprint,a detailed discussion of the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>

      <title>Detecting axion dynamics on the surface of magnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions, initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem, have recently gained attention in condensed matter physics, particularly in topological insulators. However, detecting axion dynamics has proven challenging, with no experimental confirmations to date. In this study, we identify the surface of magnetic topological insulators as an ideal platform for observing axion dynamics. The vanishing bulk gap at the surface allows for order $O(1)$ variations in the axion field, making the detection of axion-like phenomena more feasible. In contrast, these phenomena are strongly suppressed in the bulk due to the small magnetic exchange gap. We investigate two-photon decay as a signature of axion dynamics and calculate the branching ratio using a perturbative approach. Our findings reveal that the photon flux emitted from the surface is in-plane and orders of magnitude larger than that from the bulk, making it detectable with modern microwave technology. We also discuss potential material platforms for detecting axion two-photon decay and strategies to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear transport theory at the order of quantum metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metric, a probe to spacetime of the Hilbert space, has been found measurable in the nonlinear electronic transport and attracted tremendous interest. We show that the quantum metric is only a tip of the iceberg, by deriving unknown 11 out of 14 formulas of the quadratic nonlinear conductivity under the same symmetry that the quantum metric emerges. The formulas allow us to determine nonzero nonlinear conductivity elements for the magnetic point groups, calculate the quadratic nonlinear conductivity for arbitrary Hamiltonian, e.g., the even-layered MnBi$_2$Ti$_4$ thin films with and without the $C_{3}$ symmetry, and formulate scaling laws at the order of quantum metric to distinguish different mechanisms in the recent experiments. The theory is a comprehensive description of the quadratic nonlinear transport and will facilitate future experiments and applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of dynamical electron correlations on the tunnelling magnetoresistance of Fe/MgO/Fe(001) junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the non-equilibrium Green's function technique to investigate the steady-state transport properties of an Fe/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), focusing on the impact of dynamical electron correlations on the Fe $3d$ orbitals. By applying the rigid shift approximation, we extend the calculations from zero- to finite-bias in a simple and computationally efficient manner, obtaining the bias-dependent electronic structure and current-versus-voltage characteristic curve in both the parallel and antiparallel configurations. In particular, we find that dynamical electron correlation manifests as a reduction in the spin splitting of the Fe $3d_{z^2}$ state compared to DFT predictions and introduces a finite relaxation time. The impact of these effects on the transport properties, however, varies significantly between magnetic configurations. In the parallel configuration, the characteristic curves obtained with DFT and DMFT are similar, as the transport is mostly due to the coherent transmission of spin-up electrons through the MgO barrier. Conversely, in the antiparallel configuration, correlation effects become more significant, with DMFT predicting a sharp current increase due to bias-driven inelastic electron-electron scattering. As a consequence, DMFT gives a lower bias threshold for the suppression of the tunneling magnetoresistance ratio compared to DFT, matching experimental data more closely.</description>
