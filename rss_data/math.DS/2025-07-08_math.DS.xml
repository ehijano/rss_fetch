      <title>Nonstandard functional central limit theorem for nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems, including Bunimovich stadia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems with a first return time satisfying a central limit theorem (CLT) with nonstandard normalisation $(n\log n)^{1/2}$. For such systems (both maps and flows) we show that it automatically follows that the functional central limit theorem or weak invariance principle (WIP) with normalisation $(n\log n)^{1/2}$ holds for H\"older observables.
  Our approach streamlines certain arguments in the literature. Applications include various examples from billiards, geodesic flows and intermittent dynamical systems. In this way, we unify existing results as well as obtaining new results. In particular, we deduce the WIP with nonstandard normalisation for Bunimovich stadia as an immediate consequence of the corresponding CLT proved by B\'alint &amp; Gou\"ezel.</description>

      <title>Local entropy theory, combinatorics, and local theory of Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each continuous action of a countably infinite discrete group $\Gamma$ on a compact metrizable space X induces a continuous action of $\Gamma$ on the space M(X) of Borel probability measures on X. We compare the local entropy theory for these two actions, and describe the relation between their IE-tuples. Several other types of tuples are also studied. Our main tool is a new combinatorial lemma. We also give an application of the combinatorial lemma to the local theory of Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Weakly Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the major breakthroughs in science of the last (20th) century was building a bridge between the worlds of stochastic (random) systems and deterministic (dynamical) systems. It was started by the celebrated 1958 paper by A.N.Kolmogorov \cite{Kolmo}, who called this new theory (and actually a new way of thinking about deterministic systems) stochasticity of dynamical systems. Later, this name was essentially replaced by a short (sexier but more vague ``chaos theory"). Kolmogorov's discovery demonstrated that the time evolution of deterministic systems could be indistinguishable from the evolution of purely random (stochastic) systems. Moreover, it has been later established that typical deterministic systems are chaotic. However, as well as stochastic systems, which could be more or less random (from random processes with independent values to random processes with long memory) , chaotic dynamical systems could be strongly or weakly chaotic. Actually, the majority of chaotic systems are weakly chaotic, especially those that are relevant models for various real-world processes. Naturally, the theory of weakly chaotic systems is less developed because it deals with more complicated problems than the studies of strongly chaotic systems. We present here a brief review of this theory, including recently published and some new results.</description>

      <title>Variational principles of topological pressure for correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Li, Li and Zhang introduced the topological pressure for correspondences and measure-theoretic entropy for transition probability kernels. Building thereon, they established a variational principle for correspondences satisfying the forward expansiveness condition. In this work, we extend this research by deriving two types of variational principles: (i) For a class of correspondences, the topological pressure equals the supremum of the measure-theoretic pressures over extreme points of invariant measures. (ii) An abstract variational principle holds for general correspondences without requiring forward expansiveness. Furthermore, the differentiability and equilibrium states of the topological pressure for correspondences are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Network Behavioral-Feedback SIR Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a network behavioral-feedback Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model in which the interaction matrix describing the infection rates across subpopulations depends in feedback on the current epidemic state. This model captures both heterogeneities in individuals mixing, contact frequency, aptitude to contract and spread the infection, and endogenous behavioral responses such as voluntary social distancing and the adoption of self-protective measures. We study the stability of the equilibria and illustrate through several examples how the shape of the stability region depends on the structure of the interaction matrix, providing insights for the design of effective control strategies. We then analyze the transient behavior of the dynamics, showing that, for a special class of rank-1 interaction matrices, there always exists an aggregate infection curve that exhibits a unimodal behavior, expanding the results on the unimodality of infection curve known in the literature of epidemic models and paving the way for future control applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the concept of $(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{G})-$shadowing property on uniform space and say it as a topological $(\mathscr{F},\mathscr{G})-$shadowing property. We show that topological shadowing, topological $(\mathscr{D},\mathscr{F}_t)-$shadowing, topological $(\mathscr{F}_t,\mathscr{F}_t)-$shadowing and topological $(\mathbb{N},\mathscr{F}_t)-$shadowing are equivalent in compact chain recurrent dynamical system. We also prove that if minimal points of $f$ are not dense in $X$ then the system does not have $(\mathscr{P}(\mathbb{N}),\mathscr{F}_{ps})-$shadowing.</description>

      <title>Attractors for Second Order in Time Non-Conservative Dynamics with Nonlinear Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-time behavior of solutions to a nonlinear plate model subject to non-conservative and non-dissipative effects and nonlinear damping is considered. The model under study is a prototype for a suspension bridge under the effects of unstable flow of gas. To counteract the unwanted oscillations a damping mechanism of a nonlinear nature is applied. From the point of view of nonlinear PDEs, we are dealing with a non-dissipative and nonlinear second order in time dynamical system of hyperbolic nature subjected to nonlinear damping. One of the first goals is to establish ultimate dissipativity of all solutions, which will imply an existence of a weak attractor. The combined effects of non-dissipative forcing with nonlinear damping-leading to an overdamping-give rise to major challenges in proving an existence of an absorbing set. Known methods based on equipartition of the energy do not suffice. A rather general novel methodology based on ``barrier's'' method will be developed to address this and related problems. Ultimately, it will be shown that a weak attractor becomes strong, and the nonlinear PDE system has a coherent finite-dimensional asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical properties of ball expanding maps, a class of continuous self-maps defined on compact metric spaces. For a ball expanding map, we show that: (1) the set of periodic points is dense in the chain recurrent set; (2) if the topological entropy of the map is zero, then the chain recurrent set is finite; (3) the map has only finitely many chain components; (4) if the space is perfect, then the topological entropy of the map is positive; and (5) if the space is connected, then the map is locally eventually onto and hence mixing. Several examples are also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a link between billiards in convex plane domains and Hofer's geometry, an area of symplectic topology. For smooth strictly convex billiard tables, we prove that the Hofer distance between the corresponding billiard ball maps admits an upper bound in terms of a simple geometric distance between the tables. We use this result to show that the billiard ball map of a convex polygon lies in the completion, with respect to Hofer's metric, of the group of smooth area-preserving maps of the annulus. Finally, we discuss related connections to dynamics and pose several open problems.</description>

      <title>Retrodicting Chaotic Systems: An Algorithmic Information Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making accurate inferences about data is a key task in science and mathematics. Here we study the problem of \emph{retrodiction}, inferring past values of a series, in the context of chaotic dynamical systems. Specifically, we are interested in inferring the starting value $x_0$ in the series $x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n$ given the value of $x_n$, and the associated function $f$ which determines the series as $f(x_i)=x_{i+1}$. Even in the deterministic case this is a challenging problem, due to mixing and the typically exponentially many candidate past values in the pre-image of any given value $x_n$ (e.g., a current observation). We study this task from the perspective of algorithmic information theory, which motivates two approaches: One to search for the `simplest' value in the set of candidates, and one to look for the value in the lowest density region of the candidates. We test these methods numerically on the logistic map, Tent map, Bernoulli map, and Julia/Mandelbrot map, which are well-studied maps in chaos theory. The methods aid in retrodiction by assigning low ranks to candidates which are more likely to be the true starting value, which works well in some parameter and map cases, but the methods are not effective in all cases, and several open problems remain.</description>

      <title>Profinite geometric iterated monodromy groups of postcritically finite polynomials in degree 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the properties of profinite geometric iterated monodromy groups associated to polynomials. Such groups can be seen as generic representations of absolute Galois groups of number fields into the automorphism group of a regular rooted tree. Our main result is that, for a degree 3 postcritically finite polynomial over a number field, where each finite postcritical point has at least one preimage outside the critical orbits, the associated profinite geometric iterated monodromy group is finitely invariably generated. Moreover, this group is determined by the isomorphism class of the ramification portrait of the polynomial, up to conjugation by an automorphism of the ternary rooted tree. We also study the group-theoretical properties of such groups, namely their branch and torsion properties. In particular, we show that such groups are regular branch over the closure of their commutator subgroup, and that they contain torsion elements of any order realizable in the ternary tree.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Systems Perspective on the Analysis of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we utilize dynamical systems to analyze several aspects of machine learning algorithms. As an expository contribution we demonstrate how to re-formulate a wide variety of challenges from deep neural networks, (stochastic) gradient descent, and related topics into dynamical statements. We also tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of information propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the input-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal embedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions of given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural ODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural delay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks dynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent and study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis to the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon, also in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic gradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized setting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain several results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks. We describe a result that extends existing techniques to heterogeneous neural networks involving graph limits via digraph measures. This shows how large classes of neural networks naturally fall within the framework of Kuramoto-type models on graphs and their large-graph limits. Finally, we point out that similar strategies to use dynamics to study explainable and reliable AI can also be applied to settings such as generative models or fundamental issues in gradient training methods, such as backpropagation or vanishing/exploding gradients.</description>

      <title>Toward Adaptive Cooperation: Model-Based Shared Control Using LQ-Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel model-based adaptive shared control to allow for the identification and design challenge for shared-control systems, in which humans and automation share control tasks. The main challenge is the adaptive behavior of the human in such shared control interactions. Consequently, merely identifying human behavior without considering automation is insufficient and often leads to inadequate automation design. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel solution involving online identification of the human and the adaptation of shared control using Linear-Quadratic differential games. The effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation is analyzed in simulations and compared with a non-adaptive shared control from the state of the art. Finally, the proposed approach is tested through human-in-the-loop experiments, highlighting its suitability for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis of epidemic forecasting and spreading on networks with probability generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic forecasting tools embrace the stochasticity and heterogeneity of disease spread to predict the growth and size of outbreaks. Conceptually, stochasticity and heterogeneity are often modeled as branching processes or as percolation on contact networks. Mathematically, probability generating functions provide a flexible and efficient tool to describe these models and quickly produce forecasts. While their predictions are probabilistic-i.e., distributions of outcome-they depend deterministically on the input distribution of transmission statistics and/or contact structure. Since these inputs can be noisy data or models of high dimension, traditional sensitivity analyses are computationally prohibitive and are therefore rarely used. Here, we use statistical condition estimation to measure the sensitivity of stochastic polynomials representing noisy generating functions. In doing so, we can separate the stochasticity of their forecasts from potential noise in their input. For standard epidemic models, we find that predictions are most sensitive at the critical epidemic threshold (basic reproduction number $R_0 = 1$) only if the transmission is sufficiently homogeneous (dispersion parameter $k &gt; 0.3$). Surprisingly, in heterogeneous systems ($k \leq 0.3$), the sensitivity is highest for values of $R_{0} &gt; 1$. We expect our methods will improve the transparency and applicability of the growing utility of probability generating functions as epidemic forecasting tools.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt a continuous-time dynamical system approach to study the evolution of the state of a game driven by the willingness to reduce the total dissatisfaction of the coalitions about their payment. Inspired by the work of Grabisch and Sudh\"olter about core stability, we define a vector field on the set of preimputations from which is defined, for any preimputation, a cohesion curve describing the evolution of the state. We prove that for each preimputation, there exists a unique cohesion curve. Subsequently, we show that, for the cohesion flow of a balanced game, the core is the unique minimal attractor of the flow, the realm of which is the whole preimputation set. These results improve our understanding of the ubiquity of the core in the study of cooperative games with transferable utility.</description>

      <title>Existentially closed measure-preserving actions of approximately treeable groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a countable group $\Gamma$, letting $\mathcal{K}_\Gamma$ denote the class of {\pmp} actions of $\Gamma$, we study the question of when the model companion of $\mathcal{K}_\Gamma$ exists. Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\'ia showed that the model companion of $\mathcal{K}_\Gamma$ exists when $\Gamma$ is a nonabelian free group on a countable number of generators. We significantly generalize their result by showing that the model companion of $\cal K_\Gamma$ exists whenever $\Gamma$ is an approximately treeable group. The class of approximately treeable groups contain the class of treeable groups as well as the class of universally free groups, that is, the class of groups with the same universal theory as nonabelian free groups. We prove this result using an open mapping characterization of when the model companion exists; moreover, this open mapping characterization provides concrete, ergodic-theoretic axioms for the model companion when it exists. We show how to simplify these axioms in the case of treeable groups, providing an alternate axiomatization for the model companion in the case of the free group, which was first axiomatized by Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\'ia using techniques from model-theoretic stability theory. Along the way, we prove a purely ergodic-theoretic result of independent interest, namely that finitely generated universally free groups (also known as limit groups) have Kechris' property MD. We also show that for groups with Kechris' EMD property, the profinite completion action is existentially closed, and for groups without property (T), the generic existentially closed action is weakly mixing, generalizing results of Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\'ia for the case of nonabelian free groups.</description>

      <title>Estimating Free Parameters in Stochastic Oscillatory Models Using a Weighted Cost Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we estimate parameters in stochastic oscillatory systems by developing a novel cost function. This function incorporates power spectral density, analytic signal, and position crossings, each weighted to capture distinct oscillatory characteristics such as amplitude, frequency, and shape. By minimizing this cost via differential evolution, we estimate parameters in two stochastic systems given measured datasets. We validate this procedure by recovering known parameters from a test dataset. We then apply it to a biophysical model for auditory mechanics. Thus, we establish a general methodology for fitting stochastic oscillatory systems.</description>

      <title>A perturbed cellular automaton with two phase transitions for the ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The positive rates conjecture states that a one-dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) with strictly positive transition rates must be ergodic. The conjecture has been refuted by G\'acs, whose counterexample is a cellular automaton that is non-ergodic under uniform random noise with sufficiently small rate. For all known counterexamples, non-ergodicity has been proved under small enough rates. Conversely, all cellular automata are ergodic with sufficiently high-rate noise. No other types of phase transitions of ergodicity are known, and the behavior of known counterexamples under intermediate noise rates is unknown.
  We present an example of a cellular automaton with two phase transitions. Using G\'acs's result as a black box, we construct a cellular automaton that is ergodic under small noise rates, non-ergodic for slightly higher rates, and again ergodic for rates close to 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we show that there exists an autoequivalence of positive categorical entropy on the derived category of certain bielliptic surfaces. This gives the first example of a surface admitting positive categorical entropy in the absence of both positive topological entropy and any spherical objects. Moreover, we prove a Gromov-Yomdin type equality for the categorical entropy of autoequivalences on bielliptic surfaces and give a counterexample of this equality on Enriques surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the divergence-kernel formula for the scores of random dynamical systems, then formally pass to the continuous-time limit of SDEs. Our formula works for multiplicative noise systems over any period of time; it does not require hyperbolicity. We also consider several special cases: (1) for additive noise, we give a pure kernel formula; (2) for short-time, we give a pure divergence formula; (3) we give a formula which does not involve scores of the initial distribution. Based on the new formula, we derive a pathwise Monte-Carlo algorithm for scores, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system with multiplicative noise.</description>

Abstract: We study the singular values and Lyapunov exponents of non-stationary random matrix products subject to small, absolutely continuous, additive noise. Consider a fixed sequence of matrices of bounded norm. Independently perturb the matrices by additive noise distributed according to Lebesgue measure on matrices with norm less than $\epsilon$. Then the gaps between the log of the singular values of the random product of $n$ of these matrices is of order $\epsilon^2n$ in expectation, and almost surely the gap grows like $\epsilon^2n$.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and stability analysis of a third-order multiclass traffic flow model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic flow modeling spans a wide range of mathematical approaches, from microscopic descriptions of individual vehicle dynamics to macroscopic models based on aggregate quantities. A fundamental challenge in macroscopic modeling lies in the closure relations, particularly in the specification of a traffic hesitation function in second-order models like Aw-Rascle-Zhang. In this work, we propose a third-order hyperbolic traffic model in which the hesitation evolves as a driver-dependent dynamic quantity. Starting from a microscopic formulation, we relax the standard assumption by introducing an evolution law for the hesitation. This extension allows to incorporate hysteresis effects, modeling the fact that drivers respond differently when accelerating or decelerating, even under identical local traffic conditions. Furthermore, various relaxation terms are introduced. These allow us to establish relations to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model and other traffic flow models.</description>

      <title>Componentwise Polish groupoids and equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Borel equivalence relations equipped with a uniformly Borel family of Polish topologies on each equivalence class, and more generally, standard Borel groupoids equipped with such a family of topologies on each connected component. Such "componentwise Polish topologies" capture precisely the topological information determined by the Borel structure of a Polish group action, by the Becker--Kechris theorem. We prove that conversely, every abstract such Borel componentwise Polish groupoid obeying suitable axioms admits a Borel equivalence of groupoids to a global open Polish groupoid. Together with known results, this implies that every such groupoid is Borel equivalent to an action groupoid of a Polish group action; in particular, the induced equivalence relations are Borel bireducible.
  Our results are also valid for Borel groupoids with componentwise quasi-Polish topologies; and under stronger uniformity assumptions, we show that such groupoids in fact themselves admit global quasi-Polish topologies. As a byproduct, we also generalize several standard tools for Polish groups and their actions to the setting of componentwise quasi-Polish groupoids, including Vaught transforms, Effros's theorem on orbits, and the open mapping theorem.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of degenerate fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We prove a new cuplength estimate, in particular including Arnol'd conjecture over complex numbers, for fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with two point insertions. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In twisted Diophantine approximation, for a fixed $m\times n$ matrix $\boldsymbol\alpha$ one is interested in sets of vectors $\boldsymbol\beta\in\mathbb R^m$ such that the system of affine forms $\mathbb R^n \ni \mathbf q \mapsto \boldsymbol\alpha\mathbf q + \boldsymbol\beta \in \mathbb R^m$ satisfies some given Diophantine condition. In this paper we introduce the notion of manifolds which are of $\boldsymbol\alpha$-twisted Khintchine type for convergence or divergence. We provide sufficient conditions under which nondegenerate analytic manifolds exhibit this twisted Khintchine-type behaviour. Furthermore, we investigate the intersection properties of the sets of $\boldsymbol\alpha$-twisted badly approximable and well approximable vectors with nondegenerate manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide the maximal boundedness range (up to end-points) for the Bilinear Hilbert-Carleson operator along curves in the (purely) non-zero curvature setting. More precisely, we show that the operator $$ BHC_{[\vec{a},\vec{\alpha}]}(f_1,f_2)(x) := \sup_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}} \left|\,p.v.\, \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_1(x - a_1 t^{\alpha_1}) \,f_2(x - a_2 t^{\alpha_2}) \,e^{i\,\lambda\,a_3 \,t^{\alpha_3}} \,\frac{dt}{t}\right|$$ obeys the bounds $$\|BHC_{[\vec{a},\vec{\alpha}]} (f_1,f_2)\|_{L^r} \lesssim_{\vec{a} \,\vec{\alpha},r,p_1,p_2} \|f_1\|_{L^{p_1}}\,\|f_2\|_{L^{p_2}}$$ whenever $\vec{a}=(a_1,a_2,a_3),\,\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})^3$ with $\vec{\alpha}$ having pairwise distinct coordinates and for any H\"older range $\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}=\frac{1}{r}$ with $1&lt;p_1,p_2&lt;\infty$ and $\frac{1}{2}&lt;r&lt;\infty$. This result is achieved via the Rank II LGC method introduced in arXiv:2308.10706.</description>

Abstract: We summarize recent progress on the theory and applications of structural identifiability of compartmental models. On the applications side, we review identifiability analyses undertaken recently for models arising in epidemiology, oncology, and other areas; and we summarize common approaches for handling models that are unidentifiable. We also highlight recent theoretical and algorithmic results on how to reparametrize unidentifiable models and, in the context of linear compartmental models, how to predict identifiability properties directly from the model structure. Finally, we highlight future research directions.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth--Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization of orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde orbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate the method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid refinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</description>

      <title>Topological characterisation of a chaotic attractor with an additional branch generated from economic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are insights of chaotic properties in economic systems and data. To prove the existence of chaotic dynamics, the establishment of a deterministic model is mandatory. A global modelling tool (GPoM) is used to search for mathematical models of equations from economic data: unemployment, inflation and nominal exchange rate over 30 years. A system of three differential equations is chosen as a model, whose solution is a chaotic attractor in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The model extracted from the data is not able to fit them, but it provides equations linking those multiple economic variables and reveals significant impact of exchange rate on unemployment and inflation evolution. The topological characterisation of the chaotic attractor solution exhibits an additional branch in its first return map to the Poincar\'e section. Consequences of this particular structure are analysed and interpreted economically.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to time-dependent planar two-center Stark-Zeeman systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic orbits in a time-dependent two-center Stark-Zeeman system, which models the motion of a charged particle attracted by two fixed Coulomb centers and subject to external magnetic and time-dependent electric fields. A motivating example is provided by the bicircular restricted four-body problem which investigates the motion of a massless particle, influenced by the Newtonian gravitational attraction of the earth, moon and periodically moving sun. Due to singularities at the Coulomb centers, standard local variational approaches fail. To overcome this, we employ the Birkhoff regularization map and construct a non-local regularized action functional on a blown-up loop space, following a recent method due to Barutello-Ortega-Vernizi \cite{BOV21}. We show that the critical points of this regularized action functional satisfy a certain second-order delay differential equation and correspond to periodic solutions of the original system, including collisions. Additionally, we examine the symmetric structure of the regularized functional.</description>

      <title>Growth of generalized greatest common divisors along orbits of self-rational maps on projective varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a smooth projective variety $X$ defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. We prove that \begin{align} \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{h_{Y}(f^{n}(x))}{h_{H}(f^{n}(x)) } = 0, \end{align} where $h_{Y}$ is a height associated with a closed subscheme $Y \subset X$ of codimension $c$, $h_{H}$ is any ample height on $X$, and $x \in X(\overline{\mathbb{Q}})$ is a point with well-defined orbit, under the following assumptions: (1) either $f$ is a morphism, or $Y$ is pure dimensional, regularly embedded in $X$, and contained in the locus over which all iterates of $f$ are finite; (2) the orbit of $x$ is generic; (3) $d_{c}(f)^{1/c} &lt; \alpha_{f}(x)$, where $d_{c}(f)$ is the $c$-th dynamical degree of $f$ and $ \alpha_{f}(x)$ is the arithmetic degree of $x$.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent moment dynamics for networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach to moment closure problem is used to derive low dimensional laws for the dynamics of the moments of the membrane potential distribution in a population of spiking neurons. Using spectral expansion of the density equation we derive the recursive and nonlinear relation between the moments, such as the mean potential, and the population firing rates. The self-consistent dynamics found relies on the dominant eigenvalues of the evolution operator, tightly related to the moments of the single-neuron inter-spike interval distribution. Contrary to previous attempts our system can be applied both in noise- and drift-dominated regime, and both for weakly and strongly coupled population. We demonstrate the applicability of the theory for the case of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons deriving closed analytical expressions. Truncating the mode decomposition to the first few more relevant moments, results to effectively describe the population dynamics both out-of-equilibrium and in response to strongly-varying inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.08181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a weak KAM theory for parameterized cobordisms and their relaxation, holonomic measures. We find a weak kam solution in that context, and we show that in many cases it corresponds to an exact form that satisfies a version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Along the way, we give a characterization of minimizable Lagrangians, as well as some abstract weak KAM machinery.</description>

      <title>Stability criteria for rough systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantitative direct method to prove the local stability of a stationary solution for a rough differential equation and its regular discretization scheme. Using Doss-Sussmann technique and stopping time analysis, we provide stability criteria for a stationary solution of the continuous system to be exponentially stable, provided the diffusion term is bounded and its derivatives exhibit small growth. The same conclusions hold for the regular discretization scheme with a sufficiently small step size, but one needs to apply the sewing lemma and stopping times for the discrete time set. Our stability criteria are based on the linearization of the drift and require only information about the bound and growth rates of the diffusion, making them data-driven criteria.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows are all exponentially mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study strong spectral properties of Ruelle transfer operators related to Gibbs measures for contact Anosov flows. As a consequence we establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables with respect to any Gibbs measure. The approach invented in 1997 by Dolgopyat, and further developed in our papers in 2011 and 2023, is substantially enhanced here, allowing to deal with the general case of arbitrary contact Anosov flows and arbitrary Gibbs measures. The results obtained here naturally apply to geodesic flows on compact Riemannian manifolds.
  As is now well-known, the strong spectral estimates for Ruelle operators and a well-established technique by Dolgopyat lead to exponential decay of correlations for H\"older continuous potentials. Other immediate consequences are: (a) existence of a non-zero analytic continuation of the Ruelle zeta function with a pole at the entropy in a vertical strip containing the entropy in its interior; (b) a Prime Orbit Theorem with an exponentially small error.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we focus on the investigation of the BS dimension and BS packing dimension under amenable group actions. Firstly, we obtain a Bowen's equation which illustrate the relation of BS packing dimension to the packing topological pressure under amenable group actions. Moreover, we establish the variational principle and inverse variational principle for BS dimension and BS packing dimension under amenable group actions. Finally, we also get an analogue of Billingsley's type theorem for BS packing dimension under amenable group actions.</description>

Abstract: We give a rigorous definition of the T-fractal translation surface, and describe some its basic geometric and dynamical properties. In particular, we study the singularities attached to the surface by its metric completion and show there exists a Cantor set of "elusive singularities." We show these elusive singularities can be thought of as a generalization of the wild singularities introduced by Bowman and Valdez. In particular, we show that every elusive singularities has an infinite discrete set of rotational components. We also show that each rotational component of an elusive singularity with an irrational address has zero length (angle).</description>

      <title>On the neighborhood of a torus leaf and dynamics of holomorphic foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.10219v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex surface and $Y$ be an elliptic curve embedded in $X$. Assume that there exists a non-singular holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ with $Y$ as a compact leaf, defined on a neighborhood of $Y$ in $X$. We investigate the relation between Ueda's classification of the complex analytic structure of a neighborhood of $Y$ and complex dynamics of the holonomy of $\mathcal{F}$ along $Y$. More precisely, we show that the pair $(Y,X)$ is of type ($\gamma$) in his classification when there exists a closed curve in $Y$ along which the holonomy of $\mathcal{F}$ is irrationally indifferent and non-linearizable. We also investigate the metric semi-positivity of the line bundle determined by the divisor $Y$. Our approach is based on the theory of hedgehogs, due to P\'{e}rez-Marco.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of an equidistributed sequence of nondegenerate closed geodesics for generic Finsler, symmetric Finsler and Riemannian metrics on every closed surface. The proof relies on the volume property of embedded contact homology, established by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Ramos, along with specific local variational constructions and transversality arguments. Our approach is motivated by Irie's equidistribution result in [19] for three-dimensional Reeb flows and the analogous result presented by Marques, Neves and Song [27] for embedded minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13062v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the spacetime diagrams of some cellular automata have a fractal structure: for instance Pascal's triangle modulo 2 generates a Sierpinski triangle. It has been shown that such patterns can occur when the alphabet is endowed with the structure of an Abelian group, provided the cellular automaton is a morphism with respect to this structure and the initial configuration has finite support. The spacetime diagram then has a property related to k-automaticity. We show that these conditions can be relaxed: the Abelian group can be a commutative monoid, the initial configuration can be k-automatic, and the spacetime diagrams still exhibit the same regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The steering control of an autonomous unicycle is considered. The underlying dynamical model of a single rolling wheel is discussed regarding the steady state motions and their stability. The unicycle model is introduced as the simplest possible extension of the rolling wheel where the location of the center of gravity is controlled. With the help of the Appellian approach, a state space representation of the controlled nonholonomic system is built in a way that the most compact nonlinear equations of motions are constructed. Based on controllability analysis, feedback controllers are designed which successfully carry out lane changing and turning maneuvers. The behavior of the closed-loop system is demonstrated by numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07783v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide upper bounds for the Assouad spectrum $\dim_A^\theta(\text{Gr}(f))$ of the graph of a real-valued H\"older or Sobolev function $f$ defined on an interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate via examples that all of our bounds are sharp. In the setting of H\"older graphs, we further provide a geometric algorithm which takes as input the graph of an $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function satisfying a matching lower oscillation condition with exponent $\alpha$ and returns the graph of a new $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function for which the Assouad $\theta$-spectrum realizes the stated upper bound for all $\theta\in (0,1)$. Examples of functions to which this algorithm applies include the continuous nowhere differentiable functions of Weierstrass and Takagi.</description>

      <title>How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of ODE Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions in the Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to Zermelo's problem and to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Infinite polynomial patterns in large subsets of the rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson, we prove two new results about infinite polynomial configurations in large subsets of the rational numbers. First, given a finite coloring of $\mathbb{Q}$, we show that there exists an infinite set $B = \{b_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}$ such that $$\{b_i, b_i^2 + b_j : i &lt; j\}$$ is monochromatic. Second, we prove that every subset of positive density in the rational numbers contains a translate of such an infinite configuration. The corresponding results in the integers are both known to be false, so our results provide natural and relatively simple examples of combinatorial structures that distinguish between the Ramsey-theoretic properties of the rational numbers and the integers.
  The proofs of our main results build upon methods developed in a series of papers by Kra, Moreira, Richter, and Robertson to translate from combinatorics into dynamics, where the core of the argument reduces to understanding the behavior of certain polynomial ergodic averages. The new dynamical tools required for this analysis are a Wiener--Wintner theorem for polynomially-twisted ergodic averages in $\mathbb{Q}$-systems and a structure theorem for Abramov $\mathbb{Q}$-systems.</description>
