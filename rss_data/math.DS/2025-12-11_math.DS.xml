      <title>Infinitesimal containment and sparse factors of iid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce infinitesimal weak containment for measure-preserving actions of a countable group $\Gamma$: an action $(X,\mu)$ is infinitesimally contained in $(Y,\nu)$ if the statistics of the action of $\Gamma$ on small measure subsets of $X$ can be approximated inside $Y$. We show that the Bernoulli shift $[0,1]^\Gamma$ is infinitesimally contained in the left-regular action of $\Gamma$. For exact groups, this implies that sparse factor-of-iid subsets of $\Gamma$ are approximately hyperfinite. We use it to quantify a theorem of Chifan--Ioana on measured subrelations of the Bernoulli shift of an exact group. For the proof of infinitesimal containment we define \emph{entropy support maps}, which take a small subset $U$ of $\{0,1\}^I$ and assign weights to coordinates above every point of $U$, according to how ''important'' they are for the structure of the set.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic foliated entropy of suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic entropies of foliations obtained by suspensions of a representation, in the sense of Dinh, Nguy\^en and Sibony (topological and measure-theoretic). We establish a link between this type of entropy and an adapted version of an entropy defined by Ghys, Langevin and Walczak for pseudo-groups of homeomorphisms.
  Such a link has various consequences. Among them, it implies that the hyperbolic entropy of foliations is not invariant by diffeomorphisms, and that a minimal entropy suspension admits an invariant measure. Finally, this allows us to study thoroughly the simple case in which the image of the representation is isomorphic to~$\mathbb{Z}$. In that case, we give the first exact estimate of the hyperbolic entropy, and prove a Brin--Katok type theorem and a variational principle, relying strongly on the standard ones for the entropy of maps.</description>

      <title>Inverse SRB measures for endomorphisms on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend D. Burguet's construction of SRB measures for the non invertible scenario obtaining hyperbolic invariant measures with absolutely continuous disintegrations on stable manifolds for a certain class of endomorphisms on the two torus. The constructed measures maximize the folding entropy, in particular, one may obtain such SRB measures for conservative perturbations of the examples given by M. Andersson, P. Carrasco and R. Saghin for which the Lebesgue measure does not maximize the folding entropy. This way, we obtain examples of topologically mixing maps with at least two inverse SRB measures. In the case of inverse SRB measures that maximize the folding entropy, we give criteria for uniqueness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study attracting orbits escaping to infinity in natural families of transcendental entire functions. We show that, if an attracting fixed point escapes to infinity while its multiplier tends to one, then the limiting function has a doubly parabolic Baker domain. Conversely, we show that any function with an invariant doubly parabolic Baker domain can be approximated locally uniformly by functions in its quasiconformal equivalence class having an attracting fixed point whose multiplier tends to one.</description>

      <title>Random walks on cocompact Fuchsian and Kleinian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of the singularity at infinity of the hitting measure of random walks has a long history, originating from the work of Furstenberg in the 1960s. In 2011, Kaimanovich and Le Prince conjectured that the hitting measure of any finitely supported random walk on a discrete subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{SL}_N(\mathbb R)$ is singular at infinity with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Using algebraic and geometric convergence and hyperbolic Dehn filling, we prove the singularity conjecture for certain measures on ``most'' cocompact Fuchsian and Kleinian groups.</description>

      <title>Energy-Based Modeling and Structure-Preserving Discretization of Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive mathematical framework for energy-based modeling of physical systems, with particular emphasis on preserving fundamental structural properties throughout the modeling and discretization process. The approach provides systematic methods for handling challenging system classes including high-index differential-algebraic equations and nonlinear multiphysics problems. Theoretical foundations are established for regularizing constrained systems while maintaining physical consistency, analyzing stability properties, and constructing numerical discretizations that inherit the energy dissipation structure of the continuous models. The versatility and practical utility of the framework are demonstrated through applications across multiple domains including poroelastic media, nonlinear circuits, constrained mechanics, and phase-field models. The results ensure that essential physical properties such as energy balance and dissipation are maintained from the continuous formulation through to numerical implementation, providing robust foundations for computational physics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>The Uniform Random Walk on graphs, loop processes and graphings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the Uniform Random Walk (URW) on a connected, locally finite graph as the weak limit of the uniform walk of length $n$ starting at a fixed vertex. When the limit exists, it is necessarily Markovian and is independent of the starting point. For a finite graph, URW equals the Maximal Entropy Random Walk (MERW).
  We investigate the existence and phase transitions of URW for loop perturbed regular graphs and their limits. It turns out that for a sequence of finite graphs, it is the global spectral theory of the limiting graphing that governs the behavior of the finite MERWs.
  In the delocalized phase, we use a "membrane argument", showing that the principal eigenfunction of an expander graphing is stable under a small diagonal perturbation. This gives us: 1) The existence of URW on leaves; 2) The URW is a unique entropy maximizer; 3) The MERW of a finite graph sequence Benjamini-Schramm converges to the URW of the limiting graphing.
  In the localized phase, the environment seen by the particle takes the role of a finite stationary measure. We show that for canopy trees, the URW exists, is transient and maximizes entropy. We also show that for large finite graphs where most vertices have a fixed degree, localization of MERW is governed by the adjacency norm.</description>

      <title>Lazy Diffusion: Mitigating spectral collapse in generative diffusion-based stable autoregressive emulation of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows posses broadband, power-law spectra in which multiscale interactions couple high-wavenumber fluctuations to large-scale dynamics. Although diffusion-based generative models offer a principled probabilistic forecasting framework, we show that standard DDPMs induce a fundamental \emph{spectral collapse}: a Fourier-space analysis of the forward SDE reveals a closed-form, mode-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that decays monotonically in wavenumber, $|k|$ for spectra $S(k)\!\propto\!|k|^{-\lambda}$, rendering high-wavenumber modes indistinguishable from noise and producing an intrinsic spectral bias. We reinterpret the noise schedule as a spectral regularizer and introduce power-law schedules $\beta(\tau)\!\propto\!\tau^\gamma$ that preserve fine-scale structure deeper into diffusion time, along with \emph{Lazy Diffusion}, a one-step distillation method that leverages the learned score geometry to bypass long reverse-time trajectories and prevent high-$k$ degradation. Applied to high-Reynolds-number 2D Kolmogorov turbulence and $1/12^\circ$ Gulf of Mexico ocean reanalysis, these methods resolve spectral collapse, stabilize long-horizon autoregression, and restore physically realistic inertial-range scaling. Together, they show that na\"ive Gaussian scheduling is structurally incompatible with power-law physics and that physics-aware diffusion processes can yield accurate, efficient, and fully probabilistic surrogates for multiscale dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Search for Differential Equations Corresponding to Optimization Methods and Their Convergence Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuously differentiable convex function with its minimizer denoted by $x_*$ and optimal value $f_* = f(x_*)$. Optimization algorithms such as the gradient descent method can often be interpreted in the continuous-time limit as differential equations known as continuous dynamical systems. Analyzing the convergence rate of $f(x) - f_*$ in such systems often relies on constructing appropriate Lyapunov functions. However, these Lyapunov functions have been designed through heuristic reasoning rather than a systematic framework. Several studies have addressed this issue. In particular, Suh, Roh, and Ryu (2022) proposed a constructive approach that involves introducing dilated coordinates and applying integration by parts. Although this method significantly improves the process of designing Lyapunov functions, it still involves arbitrary choices among many possible options, and thus retains a heuristic nature in identifying Lyapunov functions that yield the best convergence rates. In this study, we propose a systematic framework for exploring these choices computationally. More precisely, we propose a brute-force approach using symbolic computation by computer algebra systems to explore every possibility. By formulating the design of Lyapunov functions for continuous dynamical systems as an optimization problem, we aim to optimize the Lyapunov function itself. As a result, our framework successfully reproduces many previously reported results and, in several cases, discovers new convergence rates that have not been shown in the existing studies.</description>

      <title>Determining Modes, State Reconstruction, and Intertwinement: A Synchronization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies the interrelation between the determining modes property in the two-dimensional (2D) Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) of incompressible fluids and the reconstruction property of two filtering algorithms for continuous data assimilation applied to the 2D NSE. These two properties are realized as manifestations of a more general phenomenon of "self-synchronous intertwinement." It is shown that this concept is a logically stronger form of asymptotic enslavement, as characterized by the existence of finitely many determining modes in the 2D NSE. In particular, this stronger form is shown to imply convergence of the direct-replacement filter and the nudging filter from continuous data assimilation (CDA), and then subsequently invoked to show that convergence in these filters implies that the 2D NSE possesses finitely many determining modes. The main achievement of this article is to therefore to develop a new conceptual framework, that of self-synchronous intertwinement, through which the precise inter-relationship between the determining modes property and synchronization phenomenon in these CDA filters is rigorously established and made decisively clear. The theoretical results are then complemented by numerical experiments that confirm the conclusions of the theorems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the Property (C) for a unital commutative sub-C*-algebra $D$ of a unital C*-algebra $A$, a version of the relative comparison property using almost normalizers. Under the assumption of this property, the $\mathcal Z$-absorption of $A$ is shown to imply the small boundary property of $(D, \mathrm{T}(A)|_D)$, where $A =\mathrm{C}(X) \rtimes \mathbb Z^d $ and $D = \mathrm{C}(X)$.</description>

      <title>Adjoint path-kernel method for backpropagation and data assimilation in unstable diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the adjoint path-kernel method for computing parameter-gradients (linear responses) of SDEs. Its cost is almost independent of the number of parameters, and it works for non-hyperbolic systems with parameter-controlled multiplicative noise. With this new formula, we extend the conventional backpropagation method to settings with gradient explosion, and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system.
  Moreover, we consider a difficult version of the 4D-Var data assimilation problem where (1) the deterministic part of the model is chaotic, (2) the loss is a single long-time functional accounting for discrepancies in both the observations and the dynamics, (3) some parameters in the dynamics are unknown, and (4) some coordinates of the states cannot be observed, and cannot be reasonably inferred from other coordinates within a short time. We model the correction term at each time-step separately as a parameterized function of the random state. With our new tool, we can run stochastic gradient descent to find the path and parameters that best match the low-dimensional observation data. We demonstrate this on the 10D Lorenz-96 system with 8D observations.</description>

Abstract: The topological Kuramoto model generalizes classical synchronization models by including higher-order interactions, with oscillator dynamics defined on cells of arbitrary dimension within simplicial or cell complexes. In this article, we demonstrate multistability in the topological Kuramoto model and develop the topological nonlinear Kirchhoff conditions algorithm to identify all phase-locked states on arbitrary cell complexes. The algorithm is based on a generalization of Kirchhoff's laws to cell complexes of arbitrary dimension and nonlinear interactions between cells. By applying this framework to rings, Platonic solids, and simplexes, as minimal representative motifs of larger networks, we derive explicit bounds (based on winding number constraints) that determine the number of coexisting stable states. We uncover structural cascades of multistability, inherited from both lower and higher dimensions and demonstrate that cell complexes can generate richer multistability patterns than simplicial complexes of the same dimension. Moreover, we find that multistability patterns in cell complexes appear to be determined by the number of boundary cells, hinting a possible universal pattern.</description>
