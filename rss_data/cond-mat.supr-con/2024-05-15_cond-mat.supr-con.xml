      <title>Trapped flux in a small crystal of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ at ambient pressure and in a diamond anvil pressure cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an extension of our previous work, [Sergey L Bud'ko et al 2023 Supercond. Sci. Technol. 36 115001] the measurements of temperature dependent magnetization associated with trapped magnetic flux in a small single crystal of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$, using zero-field-cooled and field-cooled protocols were performed, on the same crystal, at ambient pressure without a pressure cell and at 2.2 GPa in a commercial diamond anvil cell (DAC), showing comparable results. The data show that with a proper care and understanding, trapped flux measurements in superconductors indeed can be performed on samples in DACs under pressure, as was done on superhydrides [V S Minkov et al 2023 Nat. Phys. 19 1293].</description>

      <title>Crossover between Anomalous Peak Effects Induced by Splayed and Tilted Columnar Defects in Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density (Jc) in Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 with various configurations of columnar defects (CDs) introduced by 2.6 GeV U or 320 MeV Au irradiations. Splayed CDs are introduced by crossing CDs at a specific angle with respect to the c-axis, while tilted CDs are introduced by irradiating the sample from the direction tilted from the !-axis. We also prepared samples with asymmetric splayed CDs, which bridge the splayed CDs and the tilted CDs, by starting from the tilted CDs and adding CDs along the symmetric direction with respect to the !-axis. In all cases, non-monotonic magnetic field dependence of Jc, which we call anomalous peak effect, is observed at some fraction of the matching field when the magnetic field is applied along the specific direction depending on the configuration of CDs. We propose a model that explains the behavior of the anomalous peak effect in samples with different configuration of CDs.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced long-range charge-density wave order in the optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides (cuprate) remains elusive, with the pseudogap phase considered a potential factor. Recent attention has focused on a long-range symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) order in the underdoped regime, induced by strong magnetic fields. Here by $^{63,65}$Cu-nuclear magnetic resonance, we report the discovery of a long-range CDW order in the optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_6$ superconductor, induced by in-plane strain exceeding $|$$\varepsilon$$|$ = 0.15 %, which deliberately breaks the crystal symmetry of the CuO$_2$ plane. We find that compressive/tensile strains reduce superconductivity but enhance CDW, leaving superconductivity to coexist with CDW. The findings show that a long-range CDW order is an underlying hidden order in the pseudogap state, not limited to the underdoped regime, becoming apparent under strain. Our result sheds light on the intertwining of various orders in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Large diversity of magnetic phases in two-dimensional magnets with spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the magnetic ground states of a 2D lattice of localized magnetic moments which are coupled to a superconducting substrate with Rashba-spin-orbit coupling. We discover a rich magnetic phase diagram with surprisingly complex structures including 2q-spin-spirals, a 2x2-periodic pattern, and skyrmion lattices, self-consistently, using an effective classical spin Hamiltonian and show that the system hosts non-zero 4-spin interactions. Our in-depth analysis of about ten thousand magnetic configurations becomes feasible using contrastive clustering, a recent advanced unsupervised machine learning technique. This work proposes simple few-band systems for non-collinear magnetic states and stimulates further research on topological effects in their self-consistent electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of first-order quantum superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies on strongly disordered indium oxide films have revealed an unusual first-order quantum phase transition between the superconducting and insulating states (SIT). This transition is characterized by a discontinuous jump from non-zero to zero values of superfluid stiffness at the critical point, contradicting the conventional ``scaling scenario'' typically associated with SIT. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding this first-order transition. Our approach is based on the concept of competition between two fundamentally distinct ground states that arise from electron pairs initially localized by strong disorder: the superconducting state and the Coulomb glass insulator. These ground states are distinguished by two crucially different order parameters, suggesting a natural expectation of a discontinuous transition between them at $T=0$. This transition occurs when the magnitudes of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the Coulomb gap $E_C$ become comparable. Additionally, we extend our analysis to low non-zero temperatures and provide a mean-field ``phase diagram'' in the plane of $(T/\Delta,E_C/\Delta)$. Our results reveal the existence of a natural upper bound for the kinetic inductance of strongly disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>On the superconducting gap structure of the miassite Rh17S15: Nodal or nodeless?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent penetration depth measurement claimed the observation of unconventional superconductivity in the miassite Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ single crystals, evidenced by the linear-in-temperature penetration depth at low temperatures, thereby arguing for the presence of the lines of node in its superconducting gap structure. Here we measure the thermal conductivity of Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ single crystals down to 110 mK and up to a field of 8 T ($\simeq 0.4H{\rm_{c2}}$). In marked contrast to the penetration depth measurement, we observe a negligible residual linear term $\kappa_0/T$ in zero field, in line with the nodeless gap structure. The field dependence of $\kappa_0(H)/T$ shows a profile that is more consistent with either a highly anisotropic gap structure or multiple nodeless gaps with significantly different magnitudes. Moreover, first-principles calculations give two electronic bands with complex shape of Fermi surfaces. These results suggest multigap nodeless superconductivity in this multiband Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ superconductor.</description>

      <title>Superconducting and topological properties of compound Lu$_4$H$_7$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment has reported a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride acheving a remarkable Tc of 294 K at just 1 GPa, significantly reducing the required pressure for obtaining room temperature superconductivity. However, subsequent experimental and theoretical investigations have encountered difficulties in replicating these results, leaving the structure of this Lu-H-N compound shrouded in uncertainty. Here, we propose a stable structure for Lu$_4$H$_7$N employing first-principles calculations. Our calculations reveal that Lu$_4$H$_7$N has a Tc of 1.044 K, which can be substantially enhanced to 11.721 K at 150 GPa, due to the increasing electron-phonon coupling (EPC). Notably, we delve into the nontrivial Z2 band topology of Lu$_4$H$_7$N, featuring discernible surface states near the Fermi level, and we explore its spin Hall conductivity characteristics. Furthermore, we find that the electron doping can enhance the EPC strength and Tc of Lu$_4$H$_7$N, such as the Lu$_4$H$_7$O structure we predict simulating electron doping for Lu$_4$H$_7$N with an impressive Tc of 3.837 K. This work demonstrates the coexistence of superconducting and topological properties in a Lu-H-N system compound, which holds the promise of guiding the search for novel topological superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent Structural Evolution of Ruddlesden-Popper Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent $J. Am. Chem. Soc.$ Article (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c13094) details a pressure-temperature ($P$-$T$) phase diagram for the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO-2222) using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This study identifies a phase transition from $Amam$ (#63) to $Fmmm$ (#69) within the temperature range of 104 K to 120 K under initial pressure and attributes the $I\rm{4/}$$mmm$ (#139) space group to the structure responsible for the superconductivity of LNO-2222. Herein, we examine the temperature-dependent structural evolution of LNO-2222 single crystals at ambient pressure. Contrary to symmetry increase and the established $Amam$-$Fmmm$ phase boundary, we observe an enhancement in the $Cmcm$ reflections as temperature decreases. This work not only establishes a benchmark method for single crystal structure studies of LNO-2222 using laboratory X-rays, but also enhances the understanding of the complex crystallographic behavior of this system, contributing insights to further experimental and theoretical explorations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fluctuation and dominant superconducting pairing symmetry near the tunable Van Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetism and pairing correlations of the triangular lattice based on the Hubbard model using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method and the constrained path Monte Carlo. The results show that the presence of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping integral $t^{\prime}$ introduces an additional energy scale to the system, and through $t^{\prime}$, one can regulate the shape of the density of states and thus the position of the van Hove singularity point. Increasing inverse temperature $\beta$ and on-site interaction $U$ favor the formation of ferromagnetic correlation in a rather large filling region, and the calculations for different lattice sizes show that the range of the ferromagnetic correlations is smaller than the smallest lattice simulated at the investigated temperatures. We study the different pairing correlations of the triangular lattice near several typical fillings and show that the $f$-wave pairing dominates the system in the filling region near the van Hove singularity point with a high density of states, where the ferromagnetic correlation is also enhanced. When the filling is close to half-filling, the pairing susceptibility with $f$ wave is suppressed and the pairing susceptibility of $f_n$ wave is enhanced, however, both the effective pairing interaction with $f$ wave and $f_n$ wave are negative, which indicates that neither $f$-wave nor $f_n$-wave superconductivity may exist. Finally, we find that the pairing channel of different symmetry in the system maybe closely related to the magnetic properties. Ferromagnetic fluctuation favors the formation of $f$-wave pairing, while antiferromagnetic fluctuation tends to promote $f_n$-wave pairing.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the higher temperature pseudogap 'Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency, and also account for the excess observed linear-in-temperature specific heat (C. Girod et al., arXiv:2004.03650).</description>

      <title>Charge-4e and charge-6e flux quantization and higher charge superconductivity in kagome superconductor ring devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.10352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux quantization is a key indication of electron pairing in superconductors. For example, the well-known h/2e flux quantization is considered strong evidence for the existence of the charge-2e, two-electron Cooper pairs. Here we report evidence for multi-charge flux quantization in mesoscopic ring devices fabricated using the transition-metal kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We perform systematic magneto-transport measurements and observe unprecedented quantization of magnetic flux in units of h/4e and h/6e in magnetoresistance oscillations. Specifically, at low temperatures, magnetoresistance oscillations with period h/2e are detected, as expected from the flux quantization for charge-2e superconductivity. We find that the h/2e oscillations are suppressed and replaced by resistance oscillations with h/4e periodicity when temperature is increased. Increasing the temperature further suppresses the h/4e oscillations and robust resistance oscillations with h/6e periodicity emerge as evidence for charge-6e flux quantization. Our observations provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of multi-charge flux quanta and emergent quantum matter exhibiting higher-charge superconductivity in the strongly fluctuating region above the charge-2e Cooper pair condensate, revealing new insights into the intertwined and vestigial electronic order in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.13745v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting state typically favors a uniform spatial distribution akin to ferromagnetism. Nevertheless, the pair-density-wave state exhibits sign changes in the pairing order, leading to potential frustrations in phase coherence.We propose a mechanism to the sextetting order stemming from the frustrations in the phase coherence of a pair-density-wave state, whose spatial modulation manifests a vortex-antivortex honeycomb lattice. The classical ground state configurations are mapped to Baxter's three-coloring model, revealing a macroscopic degeneracy accompanied by extensive entropy. The phase coherence problem intertwines the U(1) phases and the vorticity variables. While the resultant color and phase fluctuations suppress the pair-density-wave order, they maintain the sextetting order above the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\text{c}}$). The $1/3$-fractional vortex emerges as the fundamental topological defect in the sextetting order. This novel mechanism of frustrated superconductivity provides an alternative explanation for the experimental observed fractional oscillations in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram and spin diode effect via spin accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-split superconductors offer new functionality compared to conventional superconductors such as diode-effects and efficient thermoelectricity. The superconducting state can nevertheless only withstand a small amount of spin-splitting. Here, we self-consistently determine the spin transport properties and the phase diagram of a spin-split superconductor in the presence of an injected spin accumulation. Energy and spin relaxation are accounted for in the relaxation time approximation via a single effective inelastic scattering parameter. We find that the spin-splitting field in the superconductor enables a spin diode effect. Moreover, we consider the superconducting phase diagram of a system in contact with a spin accumulation and in the presence of spin relaxation, and find that the inclusion of energy and spin relaxation alters the phase diagram qualitatively. In particular, these mechanisms turn out to induce a superconducting state in large parts of the phase diagram where a normal state would otherwise be the ground-state. We identify an FFLO-like state even in the presence of impurity scattering which can be controllably tuned on and off via the electrically induced spin accumulation. We explain the underlying physics from how the superconducting order parameter depends on the non-equilibrium modes in the system as well as the behavior of these modes in the presence of energy and spin relaxation when a spin-splitting field is present.</description>

      <title>Influence ScN protective thin layer on the superconducting properties of ultrathin NbN films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study delves into exploring the impact of a thin protective layer of scandium nitride (ScN) on the superconductive properties of thin films of niobium nitride (NbN) generated through reactive magnetron deposition. This is the first time such an investigation has been carried out. The article offers a comprehensive investigation of the morphological, microstructural, and electrophysical features of thin films that have undergone high-temperature annealing in an oxygen-rich environment. The dependence of the critical transition temperature of the NbN thin film on the annealing temperature of the samples in an oxygen medium, with and without ScN coating, was determined. According to X-ray reflectometry studies, it has been observed that the ScN film serves as a protective layer, even when exposed to annealing temperatures of approximately 450{\deg}C, without significantly affecting the NbN layer density or thickness. It has been shown that adding a ScN coating to a thin NbN film increases its resistance to corrosive media compared to a film without the coating.</description>

Abstract: A supercurrent flow can induce a nonvanishing spin magnetization in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with spin-orbit interaction. Often known as the non-dissipative magnetoelectric effect, these are most commonly found at linear order in supercurrent flow. Here, we argue that a nonlinear superconducting magnetoelectric effect (NSM) can naturally manifest in altermagnet/superconductor (ALM/SC) heterostructures: NSM manifests as a spin polarization generated as a second-order response to a driving supercurrent. Strikingly, we find NSM is the leading order magnetization response in ALM/SC heterostructures and survives even in the presence of centrosymmetry; $C_4 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry in altermagnets zeroes both the equilibrium magnetization as well as out-of-plane linear magnetoelectric response. This renders NSM a powerful electric and non-dissipative means of controlling magnetization in ALM/SC heterostructures, a promising platform for superconducting spintronics.</description>
