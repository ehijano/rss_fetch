      <title>Efficiently parallelizable kernel-based multi-scale algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kernel-based multi-scale method has been proven to be a powerful approximation method for scattered data approximation problems which is computationally superior to conventional kernel-based interpolation techniques. The multi-scale method is based of an hierarchy of point clouds and compactly supported radial basis functions, typically Wendland functions. There is a rich body of literature concerning the analysis of this method including error estimates. This article addresses the efficient parallelizable implementation of those methods. To this end, we present and analyse a monolithic approach to compute the kernel-based multi-scale approximation.</description>

      <title>A Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) integrator for solving three-dimensional diffusion and advection-diffusion equations in the Tucker tensor format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rank-adaptive implicit integrator for the tensor solution of three-dimensional diffusion and advection-diffusion equations. In particular, the recently developed Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) integrator is extended from two-dimensional matrix solutions to three-dimensional tensor solutions stored in a Tucker tensor decomposition. Spectral methods are considered for spatial discretizations, and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (RK) and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods are used for time discretization. The RAIL integrator first discretizes the partial differential equation fully in space and time. Then at each RK stage, the bases computed at the previous stages are augmented and reduced to predict the current (future) basis and construct projection subspaces. After updating the bases in a dimension-by-dimension manner, a Galerkin projection is performed by projecting onto the span of the previous bases and the newly updated bases. A truncation procedure according to a specified tolerance follows. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the integrator using implicit and implicit-explicit time discretizations, as well as how well the integrator captures the rank of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Projective integration schemes for nonlinear degenerate parabolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general high-order fully explicit scheme based on projective integration methods is here presented to solve systems of degenerate parabolic equations in general dimensions. The method is based on a BGK approximation of the advection-diffusion equation, where we introduce projective integration method as time integrator to deal with the stiff relaxation term. This approach exploits the clear gap in the eigenvalues spectrum of the kinetic equation, taking into account a sequence of small time steps to damp out the stiff components, followed by an extrapolation step over a large time interval. The time step restriction on the projective step is similar to the CFL condition for advection-diffusion equations. In this paper we discuss the stability and the consistency of the method, presenting some numerical simulations in one and two spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Traffic Evacuation Model for Enhancing Resilience During Railway Disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a traffic evacuation model for railway disruptions to improve resilience. The research focuses on the problem of failure of several nodes or lines on the railway network topology. We proposed a holistic approach that integrates lines of various operator companies as well as external geographical features of the railway system. The optimized evacuation model was mathematically derived based on matrix computation using nonlinear programming. The model also takes into account the capacity of the surrounding evacuation stations, as well as the travel cost. Moreover, our model can flexibly simulate disruptions at multiple stations or any number of stations and lines, enhancing its applicability. We collected the large-scale railway network of the Greater Tokyo area for experimentation and evaluation. We simulated evacuation plans for several major stations, including Tokyo, Shinjuku, and Shibuya. The results indicate that the evacuation passenger flow (EPF) and the average travel time (ATT) during emergencies were optimized, staying within both the capacity limits of the targeted neighboring stations and the disruption recovery time.</description>

      <title>An exponential integrator multicontinuum homogenization method for fractional diffusion problem with multiscale coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust and fully discretized method for solving the time fractional diffusion equation with high-contrast multiscale coefficients. We establish the homogenized equation in a coarse mesh using a multicontinuum approach and employ the exponential integrator method for time discretization. The multicontinuum upscaled model captures the physical characteristics of the solution for the high-contrast multiscale problem, including averages and gradient effects in each continuum at the coarse scale. We use the exponential integration method to address the nonlocality induced by the time fractional derivative and the stiffness from the multiscale coefficients in the semi-discretized problem. Convergence analysis of the numerical scheme is provided, along with illustrative numerical examples. Our results demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and improved stability for varying order of fractional derivatives.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of variational-hemivariational inequalities with applications in contact mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational-hemivariational inequalities are an important mathematical framework for nonsmooth problems. The framework can be used to study application problems from physical sciences and engineering that involve non-smooth and even set-valued relations, monotone or non-monotone, among physical quantities. Since no analytic solution formulas are expected for variational-hemivariational inequalities from applications, numerical methods are needed to solve the problems. This paper focuses on numerical analysis of variational-hemivariational inequalities, reporting new results as well as surveying some recent published results in the area. A general convergence result is presented for Galerkin solutions of the inequalities under minimal solution regularity conditions available from the well-posedness theory, and C\'{e}a's inequalities are derived for error estimation of numerical solutions. The finite element method and the virtual element method are taken as examples of numerical methods, optimal order error estimates for the linear element solutions are derived when the methods are applied to solve three representative contact problems under certain solution regularity assumptions. Numerical results are presented to show the performance of both the finite element method and the virtual element method, including numerical convergence orders of the numerical solutions that match the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Local time-integration for Friedrichs' systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the full discretization of Friedrichs' systems with a two-field structure, such as Maxwell's equations or the acoustic wave equation in div-grad form, cf. [14]. We focus on a discontinuous Galerkin space discretization applied to a locally refined mesh or a small region with high wave speed. This results in a stiff system of ordinary differential equations, where the stiffness is mainly caused by a small region of the spatial mesh. When using explicit time-integration schemes, the time step size is severely restricted by a few spatial elements, leading to a loss of efficiency. As a remedy, we propose and analyze a general leapfrog-based scheme which is motivated by [5]. The new, fully explicit, local time-integration method filters the stiff part of the system in such a way that its CFL condition is significantly weaker than that of the leapfrog scheme while its computational cost is only slightly larger. For this scheme, the filter function is a suitably scaled and shifted Chebyshev polynomial. While our main interest is in explicit local-time stepping schemes, the filter functions can be much more general, for instance, a certain rational function leads to the locally implicit method, proposed and analyzed in [24]. Our analysis provides sufficient conditions on the filter function to ensure full order of convergence in space and second order in time for the whole class of local time-integration schemes.</description>

      <title>Median QMC method for unbounded integrands over $\mathbb{R}^s$ in unanchored weighted Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration of Lebesgue integrable functions with respect to a density function over $\mathbb{R}^s$. We extend the construction-free median QMC rule to the unanchored weighted Sobolev space of functions defined over $\mathbb{R}^s$. By taking the median of $k=\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ independent randomized QMC estimators, we prove that for any $\epsilon\in(0,r-\frac{1}{2}]$, our method achieves a mean absolute error bound of $\mathcal{O}(N^{-r+\epsilon})$, where $N$ is the number of points and $r&gt;\frac{1}{2}$ is a parameter determined by the function space. This rate matches that of the randomized lattice rules via component-by-component (CBC) construction, while our approach requires no specific CBC constructions or prior knowledge of the space's weight structure. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method attains accuracy comparable to the CBC method and outperforms the Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Physics-based machine learning for fatigue lifetime prediction under non-uniform loading scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate lifetime prediction of structures subjected to cyclic loading is vital, especially in scenarios involving non-uniform loading histories where load sequencing critically influences structural durability. Addressing this complexity requires advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing the intricate relationship between loading sequences and fatigue lifetime. Traditional fatigue simulations are computationally prohibitive, necessitating more efficient methods. This study highlights the potential of physics-based machine learning ($\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials. Specifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from experimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction accuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically based anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and validated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens tested in uniaxial compression. The proposed approach demonstrates superior accuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in situations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of damage accumulation. Thus, a general algorithm is developed and successfully applied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with multiple loading ranges. Hereby, the $\phi$ML model serves as a surrogate to capture damage evolution across load transitions. The $\phi$ML based algorithm is subsequently employed to investigate the influence of multiple loading transitions on accumulated fatigue life, and its predictions align with trends observed in recent experimental studies. This work demonstrates $\phi$ML as a promising technique for efficient and reliable fatigue life prediction in engineering structures, with possible integration into digital twin models for real-time assessment.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Inexact Computations in Multilevel Sampling Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multilevel sampling methods, such as multilevel and multifidelity Monte Carlo, multilevel stochastic collocation, or delayed acceptance Markov chain Monte Carlo, have become standard uncertainty quantification tools for a wide class of forward and inverse problems. The underlying idea is to achieve faster convergence by leveraging a hierarchy of models, such as partial differential equation (PDE) or stochastic differential equation (SDE) discretisations with increasing accuracy. By optimally redistributing work among the levels, multilevel methods can achieve significant performance improvement compared to single level methods working with one high-fidelity model. Intuitively, approximate solutions on coarser levels can tolerate large computational error without affecting the overall accuracy. We show how this can be used in high-performance computing applications to obtain a significant performance gain.
  As a use case, we analyse the computational error in the standard multilevel Monte Carlo method and formulate an adaptive algorithm which determines a minimum required computational accuracy on each level of discretisation. We show two examples of how the inexactness can be converted into actual gains using an elliptic PDE with lognormal random coefficients. Using a low precision sparse direct solver combined with iterative refinement results in a simulated gain in memory references of up to $3.5\times$ compared to the reference double precision solver; while using a MINRES iterative solver, a practical speedup of up to $1.5\times$ in terms of FLOPs is achieved. These results provide a step in the direction of energy-aware scientific computing, with significant potential for energy savings.</description>

      <title>Butcher series for Hamiltonian Poisson integrators through symplectic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Poisson diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

      <title>Transmission problems and domain decompositions for non-autonomous parabolic equations on evolving domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parabolic equations on evolving domains model a multitude of applications including various industrial processes such as the molding of heated materials. Such equations are numerically challenging as they require large-scale computations and the usage of parallel hardware. Domain decomposition is a common choice of numerical method for stationary domains, as it gives rise to parallel discretizations. In this study, we introduce a variational framework that extends the use of such methods to evolving domains. In particular, we prove that transmission problems on evolving domains are well posed and equivalent to the corresponding parabolic problems. This in turn implies that the standard non-overlapping domain decompositions, including the Robin-Robin method, become well defined approximations. Furthermore, we prove the convergence of the Robin--Robin method. The framework is based on a generalization of fractional Sobolev-Bochner spaces on evolving domains, time-dependent Steklov-Poincar\'e operators, and elements of the approximation theory for monotone maps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be analyzed via their Frobenius-Perron transfer operator and its estimation from data is an active field of research. Recently entropic transfer operators have been introduced to estimate the operator of deterministic systems. The approach is based on the regularizing properties of entropic optimal transport plans. In this article we generalize the method to stochastic and non-stationary systems and give a quantitative convergence analysis of the empirical operator as the available samples increase. We introduce a way to extend the operator's eigenfunctions to previously unseen samples, such that they can be efficiently included into a spectral embedding. The practicality and numerical scalability of the method are demonstrated on a real-world fluid dynamics experiment.</description>

      <title>Identification of Feasible Regions Using R-Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of flexibility analysis is to identify and define the feasibility region, which represents the range of operational conditions (e.g., variations in process parameters) that ensure safe, reliable, and feasible process performance. This work introduces a novel flexibility analysis method that requires only that model constraints (e.g., defining product Critical Quality Attributes or process Key Performance Indicators) be explicitly provided or approximated by a closed-form function, such as a multivariate polynomial model. The method is based on V.L. Rvachev's R-functions, enabling an explicit analytical representation of the feasibility region without relying on complex optimization-based approaches. R-functions offer a framework for describing intricate geometric shapes and performing operations on them using implicit functions and inequality constraints. The theory of R-functions facilitates the identification of feasibility regions through algebraic manipulation, making it a more practical alternative to traditional optimization-based methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a suite of well-known test cases from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-order, sharp-interface method for simulation of two-phase flow of real gases using implicit shock tracking. The method is based on a phase-field formulation of two-phase, compressible, inviscid flow with a trivial mixture model. Implicit shock tracking is a high-order, optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that automatically aligns mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps. It is used to accurately approximate shocks and rarefactions without stabilization and converge the phase-field solution to a sharp interface one by aligning mesh faces with the material interface. Time-dependent problems are formulated as steady problems in a space-time domain where complex wave interactions (e.g., intersections and reflections) manifest as space-time triplet points. The space-time formulation avoids complex re-meshing and solution transfer that would be required to track moving waves with mesh faces using the method of lines. The approach is applied to several two-phase flow Riemann problems involving gases with ideal, stiffened gas, and Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equations of state, including a spherically symmetric underwater explosion problem. In all cases, the method aligns element faces with all shocks (including secondary shocks that form at time t &gt; 0), rarefactions, and material interfaces, and accurately resolves the flow field on coarse space-time grids.</description>

      <title>The latent variable proximal point algorithm for variational problems with inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latent variable proximal point (LVPP) algorithm is a framework for solving infinite-dimensional variational problems with pointwise inequality constraints. The algorithm is a saddle point reformulation of the Bregman proximal point algorithm. At the continuous level, the two formulations are equivalent, but the saddle point formulation is more amenable to discretization because it introduces a structure-preserving transformation between a latent function space and the feasible set. Working in this latent space is much more convenient for enforcing inequality constraints than the feasible set, as discretizations can employ general linear combinations of suitable basis functions, and nonlinear solvers can involve general additive updates. LVPP yields numerical methods with observed mesh-independence for obstacle problems, contact, fracture, plasticity, and others besides; in many cases, for the first time. The framework also extends to more complex constraints, providing means to enforce convexity in the Monge--Amp\`ere equation and handling quasi-variational inequalities, where the underlying constraint depends implicitly on the unknown solution. In this paper, we describe the LVPP algorithm in a general form and apply it to twelve problems from across mathematics.</description>

      <title>Multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary Grad-Shafranov problem on MAST-U</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Grad-Shafranov (GS) equation is a nonlinear elliptic partial differential equation that governs the ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium of a tokamak plasma. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions to the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma current density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of whether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with more complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions (commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered. In this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward free-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated evolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm. By varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil currents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium solutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We suggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the restrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally couples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the interior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for wider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple solutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their potential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.</description>

Abstract: We study the computability of the operator norm of a matrix with respect to norms induced by linear operators. Our findings reveal that this problem can be solved exactly in polynomial time in certain situations, and we discuss how it can be approximated in other cases. Along the way, we investigate the concept of push-forward and pull-back of seminorms, which leads us to uncover novel duality principles that come into play when optimizing over the unit ball of norms.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Fourier extension based on boundary interval data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first propose a new algorithm for the computation of Fourier extension based on boundary data, which can obtain a super-algebraic convergent Fourier approximation for non-periodic functions. The algorithm calculates the extended part using the boundary interval data and then combines it with the original data to form the data of the extended function within a period. By testing the key parameters involved, their influences on the algorithm was clarified and an optimization setting scheme for the parameters was proposed. Compared with FFT, the algorithm only needs to increase the computational complexity by a small amount. Then, an improved algorithm for the boundary oscillation function is proposed. By refining the boundary grid, the resolution constant of the boundary oscillation function was reduced to approximately 1/4 of the original method.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel method employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Deep collocation method: A framework for solving PDEs using neural networks with error control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown significant potential in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). While deep networks are capable of approximating complex functions, direct one-shot training often faces limitations in both accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive method that uses single-hidden-layer neural networks to construct basis functions guided by the equation residual. The approximate solution is computed within the space spanned by these basis functions, employing a collocation least squares scheme. As the approximation space gradually expands, the solution is iteratively refined; meanwhile, the progressive improvements serve as reliable {\it a posteriori} error indicators that guide the termination of the sequential updates. Additionally, we introduce adaptive strategies for collocation point selection and parameter initialization to enhance robustness and improve the expressiveness of the neural networks. We also derive the approximation error estimate and validate the proposed method with several numerical experiments on various challenging PDEs, demonstrating both high accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction via simple random walk and Brownian motion couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study a discrete and continuous version of the spectral Dirichlet problem in an open bounded connected set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed upon exiting the (large) bounded domain $\Omega_N = (N\Omega)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We denote by $P_N$ the corresponding transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$. With probabilistic arguments (namely gambler's ruin estimates and coupling techniques) and under mild assumptions on the domain, we are able to give regularity estimates on $\phi_N$ (namely on its $k$-th order differences), with a uniform control inside $\Omega_N$. The same holds true for the first eigenfunction $\varphi_1$ of the corresponding continuous spectral Dirichlet problem, this being related to a Brownian motion killed upon exiting $\Omega$. As corollaries, we derive the $L^2$ and uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to $\varphi_1$ in Lipschitz bounded domains.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Extension of the Variable Projection (VarPro) Method for NURBS-based Conformal Surface Flattening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of computer graphics, conformal surface flattening has been widely studied for tasks such as texture mapping, geometry processing, and mesh generation. Typically, existing methods aim to flatten a given input geometry while preserving conformality as much as possible, meaning the result is only as conformal as possible. By contrast, this study focuses on surfaces that can be flattened conformally without singularities, making the process a coupled problem: the input (or target) surface must be recursively refined while its flattening is computed.
  Although the uniformization theorem or the Riemann mapping theorem guarantees the existence of a conformal flattening for any simply connected, orientable surface, those theorems permit singularities in the flattening. If singularities are not allowed, only a special class of surfaces can be conformally flattened-though many practical surfaces do fall into this class.
  To address this, we develop a NURBS-based approach in which both the input surface and its flattening are refined in tandem, ensuring mutual conformality. Because NURBS surfaces cannot represent singularities, the resulting pair of surfaces is naturally singularity-free. Our work is inspired by the form-finding method by [Miki and Mitchell 2022, 2024], which solves bilinear PDEs by iteratively refining two surfaces together. Building on their demonstration of the effectiveness of variable projection (VarPro), we adopt a similar strategy: VarPro alternates between a linear projection and a nonlinear iteration, leveraging a partially linear (separable) problem structure. However, since our conformal condition separates into two nonlinear subproblems, we introduce a nonlinear extension of VarPro. Although this significantly increases computational cost, the quality of the results is noteworthy.</description>
