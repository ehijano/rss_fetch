      <title>Big5PersonalityEssays: Introducing a Novel Synthetic Generated Dataset Consisting of Short State-of-Consciousness Essays Annotated Based on the Five Factor Model of Personality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the high advances of large language models (LLM) it is of vital importance to study their behaviors and apply their utility in all kinds of scientific fields. Psychology has been, in recent years, poorly approached using novel computational tools. One of the reasons is the high complexity of the data required for a proper analysis. Moreover, psychology, with a focus on psychometry, has few datasets available for analysis and artificial intelligence usage. Because of these facts, this study introduces a synthethic database of short essays labeled based on the five factor model (FFM) of personality traits.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Classification of Research Fields in the "Web of Science" Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical classification system that automatically categorizes a scholarly publication using its abstract into a three-tier hierarchical label set (discipline, field, subfield) in a multi-class setting. This system enables a holistic categorization of research activities in the mentioned hierarchy in terms of knowledge production through articles and impact through citations, permitting those activities to fall into multiple categories. The classification system distinguishes 44 disciplines, 718 fields and 1,485 subfields among 160 million abstract snippets in Microsoft Academic Graph (version 2018-05-17). We used batch training in a modularized and distributed fashion to address and allow for interdisciplinary and interfield classifications in single-label and multi-label settings. In total, we have conducted 3,140 experiments in all considered models (Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Transformers). The classification accuracy is &gt; 90% in 77.13% and 78.19% of the single-label and multi-label classifications, respectively. We examine the advantages of our classification by its ability to better align research texts and output with disciplines, to adequately classify them in an automated way, and to capture the degree of interdisciplinarity. The proposed system (a set of pre-trained models) can serve as a backbone to an interactive system for indexing scientific publications in the future.</description>

      <title>Astronomy in Colombia: a bibliometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Colombia, astronomical research is experiencing accelerated growth. To better understand its evolution and current state, we conducted a bibliometric study using data from the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and the Web of Science (WoS). In the ADS, we identified 422 peer-reviewed publications from 1980, the year of the first publication, until 2023, the cut-off year of the study. Of the 25 Colombian institutions participating in at least one publication, 14 are private and 11 are state institutions. More than half of these institutions are concentrated in two main cities: Bogot\'a with 11 institutions, followed by Medell\'in with 3 institutions. The number of contributions from four universities stands out: Universidad de los Andes, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Universidad Industrial de Santander, and Universidad de Antioquia with 104, 78, 68, and 67 publications, respectively. By cross-referencing the information from the ADS and the WoS, we found that the areas in which publications with the highest impact are found are three: high energies and fundamental physics, stars and stellar physics, and galaxies and cosmology. At the global level, according to the WoS, Colombia ranks 52nd in the number of peer-reviewed publications between 2019 and 2023 and fifth in Latin America. Additionally, we identified three highly cited publications (top 1% worldwide) belonging to the field of observational cosmology.</description>
