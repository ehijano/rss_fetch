      <title>Metric degeneracies and gradient flows on symplectic leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Poisson manifold endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian metric, we investigate degeneracies arising when the metric is restricted to symplectic leaves. Central to this work is the generalized double bracket (GDB) vector field-a geometric construct introduced in our earlier work-which generalizes gradient dynamics to indefinite metric settings. We identify admissible regions where the so-called double bracket metric remains non-degenerate on symplectic leaves, enabling the GDB vector field to function as a gradient flow on the admissible regions with respect to this metric. We illustrate these concepts with a variety of examples and carefully discuss the complications that arise when the pseudo-Riemannian metric fails to induce a non-degenerate metric on certain regions of the symplectic leaves.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Space of Compact CMC Hypersurfaces in Spheres, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In R^3, let M be the infinite union of unit spheres whose centers lie at even integers on the x-axis; every pair of consecutive spheres touches at (2m+1, 0, 0). Desingularizing these point contacts yields Delaunay's classical constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces, including unduloids and nodoids.
  Motivated by this picture, we construct an analogue in the unit sphere S^4. We begin with the piecewise-smooth hypersurface M contained in S^4, obtained by gluing two carefully chosen totally umbilical 3-spheres to two specific Clifford hypersurfaces, all four components sharing the same constant mean curvature and meeting along four disjoint circles.
  We provide numerical evidence that these circles can be desingularized: there exists a smooth one-parameter family Sigma_b, each lying in S^4, of CMC hypersurfaces such that Sigma_b approaches M as b tends to 0. The mean curvature H(b) varies smoothly along the family and vanishes at a single non-embedded minimal member. Moreover, there is a threshold B_1 in (0, B) such that when b &lt; B_1 the hypersurface Sigma_b is embedded ("unduloid type"), whereas for b &gt;= B_1 it is non-embedded ("nodoid type"). As b increases toward B, the hypersurfaces converge to a minimal hypersurface with two singular points.</description>

      <title>Pre-K\"ahler structures and finite-nondegeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the geometry of Levi degenerate CR hypersurfaces, we define a pre-K\"ahler structure on a complex manifold as a pre-symplectic structure compatible with the almost complex structure, i.e. a closed (1,1)-form. Extending Freeman filtration to the pre-K\"ahler setting, we define holomorphic degeneration and finite-nondegeneracy and show that the symmetry algebra of a real analytic pre-K\"ahler structure is finite-dimensional if and only if it is finitely nondegenerate. Concurrently, we extend the classical correspondence between K\"ahler and Sasakian structures to the pre-K\"ahler setting, i.e. a one-to-one (local) correspondence between $k$-nondegenerate CR hypersurfaces equipped with a transverse infinitesimal symmetry and $k$-nondegenerate pre-K\"ahler structures. We additionally formalize a second relationship between the categories, constructing a natural $k$-nondegenerate pre-K\"ahler structure defined on a line bundle over such CR structures via pre-symplectification.
  Focusing on the lowest dimensional case, we solve the equivalence problem of non-K\"ahler pre-K\"ahler complex surfaces that are 2-nondegenerate by associating a Cartan geometry to them and explicitly express their local invariants in terms of the fifth jet of a potential function. We describe the vanishing of their basic invariants in terms of a double fibration, which gives a pre-K\"ahler characterization of the twistor bundle of symplectic connections on surfaces. Lastly, our study of pre-K\"ahler complex surfaces that are symmetry reductions of homogeneous 2-nondegenerate CR 5-manifolds leads to a characterization of certain critical symplectic connections on surfaces and shows locally homogeneous 2-nondegenerate pre-K\"ahler complex surfaces are flat.</description>

      <title>Volume spectrum of fiber bundles and the widths of Berger spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish that for a fiber bundle $\pi: E \to B$, which is a Riemannian submersion, the volume spectrum of $E$ is bounded above by the product of the volume spectrum of $B$ and the volume of the largest fiber. Specifically, we prove the following inequality: \[ \omega_p(E,g_E) \leq \left( \sup_{b \in B} \vol_{g_E}(\pi^{-1}(b)) \right) \omega_p(B,g_B). \] Furthermore, we extend this result to the phase transition spectrum. In addition, we also obtain lower bounds for the isoperimetric profile of Riemannian fibrations with totally geodesic, spherical fibers in terms of the isoperimetric profile of the product of the base and a sphere. By exploiting connections between volume spectrum, least area minimal surfaces, and the isoperimetric profile, we employ these bounds to compute the low widths of Berger spheres and product of spheres. Notably, our analysis reveals that for sufficiently small $\tau$, the equatorial sphere $S^2 \in S^3_{\tau}$ attains the Simon-Smith $1,2,3,4$ widths but fails to attain any lower widths, in both the Almgren-Pitts setting and the Allen-Cahn setting.</description>

      <title>Flows of $G_2$-structures, II: Curvature, torsion, symbols, and functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the investigation of general geometric flows of $G_2$-structures initiated by the third author in "Flows of $G_2$-structures, I." Specifically, we determine the possible geometric flows (up to lower order terms) of $G_2$-structures which are second order quasilinear, by explicitly computing all independent second order differential invariants of $G_2$-structures which are $3$-forms. There are four symmetric $2$-tensors and two vector fields. We do this by deriving explicit computational descriptions of the decompositions of the curvature and the covariant derivative of the torsion into irreducible $G_2$-representations, as well as the decomposition of the $G_2$-Bianchi identity into independent relations. We also show that these six tensors arise as leading order contributions to the Euler-Lagrange equations for the energy functionals of the four independent torsion components, and we establish a $G_2$-analogue of the classical block decomposition of the Riemann curvature operator on oriented $4$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds.
  Finally, we present a large class of geometric flows of $G_2$-structures which are directly amenable to a deTurck type trick to establish short-time existence and uniqueness, with no initial assumption on the torsion, vastly generalizing an earlier result of Weiss-Witt for the negative gradient flow of the Dirichlet energy. This result is proved through a careful analysis of the principal symbols of the linearizations of these operators, establishing particular linear combinations for which one can prove that the failure of strict parabolicity is due precisely to the diffeomorphism invariance.
  A detailed introductory section on various foundational results of $G_2$-structure, several of which are not readily available in the literature, should be of wider interest and applicability.</description>

      <title>Weighted cscK metrics on K\"ahler varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the weighted constant scalar curvature K\"ahler equations on mildly singular K\"ahler varieties. Assuming the existence of a suitable resolution of singularities, we establish the existence of singular weighted cscK metrics when the weighted Mabuchi functional is coercive for an extremal weight. This extends the works of Chen-Cheng and He to the singular weighted setting. Moreover, we provide a method for constructing examples of singular cscK metrics inspired by the work of Arezzo--Pacard. In contrast to the usual gluing techniques, our approach does not require a precise understanding about of the metric behavior near the singular locus.</description>

      <title>A Conformal Quasi Einstein Characterization Of The Round Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the following result of Cochran ``A closed $m$-quasi Einstein manifold ($M,g,X$) with $m \ne -2$ has constant scalar curvature if and only if $X$ is Killing" covering the missing accidental case $m=-2$ and generalize it showing that $X$ is Killing if the integral of the Lie derivative of the scalar curvature along $X$ is non-positive. For a closed $m$-quasi Einstein manifold of dimension $n \ge 2$, if $X$ is conformal, then it is Killing; and in addition, if $M$ admits a non-Killing conformal vector field $V$, then it is globally isometric to a sphere and $V$ is gradient for $n &gt; 2$. Finally, we derive an integral identity for a vector field on a closed Riemannian manifold, which provides a direct proof of the Bourguignon-Ezin conservation identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:dg-ga/9612010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any Riemannian foliation F on a closed manifold M with an arbitrary bundle-like metric, leafwise heat flow of differential forms is proved to preserve smoothness on M at infinite time. This result and its proof have consequences about the space of bundle-like metrics on M, about the dimension of the space of leafwise harmonic forms, and mainly about the second term of the differentiable spectral sequence of F.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic limits and spectral sequences for Riemannian foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9902147</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/9902147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For general Riemannian foliations, spectral asymptotics of the Laplacian is studied when the metric on the ambient manifold is blown up in directions normal to the leaves (adiabatic limit). The number of ``small'' eigenvalues is given in terms of the differentiable spectral sequence of the foliation. The asymptotics of the corresponding eigenforms also leads to a Hodge theoretic description of this spectral sequence. This is an extension of results of Mazzeo-Melrose and R. Forman.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of Lie-Yamaguti algebra bundle, define its cohomology groups with coefficients in a representation and show that such bundles appeared naturally from geometric considerations in the work of M. Kikkawa, which motivates us to introduce this object in the proper mathematical framework. We also study abelian extensions of Lie-Yamaguti algebra bundles and investigate their relationship with suitable cohomology group.</description>

      <title>Static vacuum 3+1 black holes that cannot be put into stationary rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that some of the static Myers/Korotkin-Nicolai (MKN) vacuum 3+1 static black holes cannot be put into stationary rotation. Namely, they cannot be deformed into axisymmetric stationary vacuum black holes with non-zero angular momentum. We also prove that this occurs in particular for those MKN solutions for which the distance along the axis between the two poles of the horizon is sufficiently small compared to the square root of its area. The MKN solutions, sometimes called periodic Schwarzschild, are physically regular, have no struts or singularities, but are asymptotically Kasner.
  The static rigidity presented here appears to be the first in the literature of General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04910v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of slope stability and the Hermitian Einstein metric for big cohomology classes. The main result is the Kobayashi Hitchin correspondence on compact normal spaces with big classes admitting the birational Zariski decomposition with semiample positive part. We also prove the Bogomolov Gieseker inequality for slope stable sheaves with respect to big and nef classes. Through this paper, the bimeromorphic invariance of slope stability and the existence of Hermitian Einstein metrics plays an essential role.</description>

      <title>Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the duality between Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Schwarzian field theory, we show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism and (1) the length and the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve in the hyperbolic disk $\mathbb{D}$, (2) the asymptotic excess in the isoperimetric inequality for the equidistant Epstein foliation, (3) the variation of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation, and (4) the asymptotic change in hyperbolic area under a conformal distortion near the circle.
  Together with the isoperimetric inequality and the monotonicity of the Loewner energy, our identities immediately imply two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzian action for circle diffeomorphisms. Moreover, we extend the identity (1) to the dual Epstein curve in de Sitter $2$-space, to the Schwarzian action for the coadjoint orbits $\mathrm{M\"{o}b}_n (\mathbb{S}^1) \backslash \mathrm{Diff}(\mathbb{S}^1)$, and to piecewise M\"obius circle diffeomorphisms which are only $C^{1,1}$ regular.
  We also show that the horocycle truncation used in the construction of the Epstein curve defines a renormalized length of hyperbolic geodesics in $\mathbb{D}$, which coincides with the log of the bi-local observable. From this, we show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>A Nash-Kuiper theorem for isometric immersions beyond Borisov's exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any short immersion from an $n$-dimensional bounded and simply connected domain into $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ and any H\"older exponent $\alpha&lt;(1+n^2-n)^{-1}$, we construct a $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersion arbitrarily close in the $C^0$ topology. This extends the classical Nash--Kuiper theorem and shows the flexibility of $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersions beyond Borisov's exponent. In particular, for $n=2$, the regularity threshold aligns with the Onsager exponent $1/3$ for the incompressible Euler equations. Our proof relies on three novelties that allow for the cancellation of leading-order error terms in the convex integration scheme: a new corrugation ansatz, an integration by parts procedure, and an adapted algebraic decomposition of these errors.</description>

      <title>Infinite combinatorial Ricci flow in spherical background geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the fundamental work of Chow-Luo \cite{CL03}, Ge \cite{Ge12,Ge17} et al., the combinatorial curvature flow methods became a basic technique in the study of circle pattern theory. In this paper, we investigate the combinatorial Ricci flow with prescribed total geodesic curvatures in spherical background geometry. For infinite cellular decompositions, we establish the existence of a solution to the flow equation for all time. Furthermore, under an additional condition, we prove that the solution converges as time tends to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of an infinite combinatorial curvature flow in spherical background geometry.</description>
