      <title>Non-Normal Magidor-Radin Types of Forcings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the non-normal variations of two classical Prikry-type forcings; namely, Magidor and Radin forcings. We generalize the fact that the non-normal Prikry forcing is a projection of the extender-based to a coordinate of the extender to our forcing and the Radin/Magidor-Radin-extender-based forcing from \cite{CarmiMagidorRadin,CarmiRadin}.
  Then, we show that both the non-normal variation of Magidor and Radin forcings can add a Cohen generic function to every limit point of cofinality $\omega$ of the generic club. Second, we show that this phenomenon is limited to the cases where the forcings are not designed to change the cofinality of a measurable $\kappa$ to $\omega_1$. Specifically, in the above-mentioned circumstances these forcings do not project onto any $\kappa$-distributive forcing. We use that to conclude that the extender-based Radin/Magidor-Radin forcing does not add fresh subsets to $\kappa$ as well. In the second part of the paper we focus on the natural non-normal variation of Gitik's forcing from \cite[\S3]{GitikNonStationary}. Our main result shows that this poset can be employed to change the cofinality of a measurable cardinal $\kappa$ to $\omega_1$ while introducing a Cohen subset of $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Ultrafilter extensions of bounded graphs are elementary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main motivation of this paper is the study of first-order model theoretic properties of structures having their roots in modal logic. We will focus on the connections between ultrafilter extensions and ultrapowers. We show that certain structures (called bounded graphs) are elementary substructures of their ultrafilter extensions, moreover their modal logics coincide.</description>

      <title>Uniform Algebras: Models and constructive Completeness for Full, Simply Typed {\lambda}Prolog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a model theory for resolution on Higher Order Hereditarily Harrop formulae (HOHH), the logic underlying the Lambda-Prolog programming language, and proves soundness and completeness of resolution. The semantics and the proof of completeness of the formal system is shown in several ways, suitably adapted to deal with the impredicativity of higher-order logic, which rules out definitions of truth based on induction on formula structure. First, we use the least fixed point of a certain operator on interpretations, in the style of Apt and Van Emden, Then a constructive completeness theorem is given using a proof theoretic variant of the Lindenbaum algebra, which also contains a new approach to establishing cut-elimination.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Null: Remarks on Equivalence Testing and the Topology of Confirmation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing is a dominant framework for conducting statistical analysis across the sciences. There remains considerable debate as to whether, and under what circumstances, evidence can be said to be confirmatory of a null hypothesis. This paper presents a modal logic of short-run frequentist confirmation developed by leveraging the duality between hypothesis testing and statistical estimation.
  It is shown that a hypothesis is confirmable if and only if it satisfies the topological condition of having nonempty interior. Consequently, two-sided hypotheses are not statistically confirmable owing to defects in their topological structure. Equivalence hypotheses are, by contrast, confirmable.</description>

      <title>Borel fields and measured fields of Polish spaces, Banach spaces, von Neumann algebras and C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent articles in operator algebras make a nontrivial use of the theory of measurable fields of von Neumann algebras $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ and related structures. This includes the associated field $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ of automorphism groups and more general measurable fields of Polish groups with actions on Polish spaces. Nevertheless, a fully rigorous and at the same time sufficiently broad and flexible theory of such Borel fields and measurable fields is not available in the literature. We fill this gap in this paper and include a few counterexamples to illustrate the subtlety: for instance, for a Borel field $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ of von Neumann algebras, the field of Polish groups $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ need not be Borel.</description>

      <title>Conjunctive categorial grammars and Lambek grammars with additives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new family of categorial grammars is proposed, defined by enriching basic categorial grammars with a conjunction operation. It is proved that the formalism obtained in this way has the same expressive power as conjunctive grammars, that is, context-free grammars enhanced with conjunction. It is also shown that categorial grammars with conjunction can be naturally embedded into the Lambek calculus with conjunction and disjunction operations. This further implies that a certain NP-complete set can be defined in the Lambek calculus with conjunction. We also show how to handle some subtle issues connected with the empty string. Finally, we prove that a language generated by a conjunctive grammar can be described by a Lambek grammar with disjunction (but without conjunction).</description>

      <title>Log-Noetherian functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the class of \emph{Log-Noetherian} (LN) functions. These are holomorphic solutions to algebraic differential equations (in several variables) with logarithmic singularities. We prove an upper bound on the number of solutions for systems of LN equations, resolving in particular Khovanskii's conjecture for Noetherian functions. Consequently, we show that the structure ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN}$ generated by LN-functions, as well as its expansion ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$, are effectively o-minimal: definable sets in these structures admit effective bounds on their complexity in terms of the complexity of the defining formulas.
  We show that ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$ contains the horizontal sections of regular flat connections with quasiunipotent monodromy over algebraic varieties. It therefore contains the universal covers of Shimura varieties and period maps of polarized variations of $\mathbb Z$-Hodge structures. We also give an effective Pila-Wilkie theorem for ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$-definable sets. Thus ${\mathbb R}_\text{LN,exp}$ can be used as an effective variant of ${\mathbb R}_\text{an,exp}$ in the various applications of o-minimality to arithmetic geometry and Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>A novel framework for systematic propositional formula simplification based on existential graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel simplification calculus for propositional logic derived from Peirce's existential graphs' rules of inference and implication graphs. Our rules can be applied to propositional logic formulae in nested form, are equivalence-preserving, guarantee a monotonically decreasing number of variables, clauses and literals, and maximise the preservation of structural problem information. Our techniques can also be seen as higher-level SAT preprocessing, and we show how one of our rules (TWSR) generalises and streamlines most of the known equivalence-preserving SAT preprocessing methods. In addition, we propose a simplification procedure based on the systematic application of two of our rules (EPR and TWSR) which is solver-agnostic and can be used to simplify large Boolean satisfiability problems and propositional formulae in arbitrary form, and we provide a formal analysis of its algorithmic complexity in terms of space and time. Finally, we show how our rules can be further extended with a novel n-ary implication graph to capture all known equivalence-preserving preprocessing procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homogeneity aspects of metric spaces in which all triples of distinct points admit pairwise different distances; such spaces are called isosceles-free. In particular, we characterize all homogeneous isosceles-free spaces up to isometry as vector spaces over the two-element field, endowed with an injective norm. Using isosceles-free decompositions, we provide bounds on the maximal number of distances in arbitrary homogeneous finite metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Datalog-Expressibility for Monadic and Guarded Second-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the sentences in Monadic Second-order Logic (MSO) that are over finite structures equivalent to a Datalog program, in terms of an existential pebble game. We also show that for every class C of finite structures that can be expressed in MSO and is closed under homomorphisms, and for all integers l,k, there exists a canonical Datalog program Pi of width (l,k) in the sense of Feder and Verdi. The same characterisations also hold for Guarded Second-order Logic (GSO), which properly extends MSO. To prove our results, we show that every class C in GSO whose complement is closed under homomorphisms is a finite union of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) of countably categorical structures. The intersection of MSO and Datalog is known to contain the class of nested monadically defined queries (Nemodeq); likewise, we show that the intersection of GSO and Datalog contains all problems that can be expressed by the more expressive language of nested guarded queries. Yet, by exploiting our results, we can show that neither of the two query languages can serve as a characterization, as we exhibit a query in the intersection of MSO and Datalog that is not expressible in nested guarded queries.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Implicit Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular (or cyclic) proofs have received increasing attention in recent years, and have been proposed as an alternative setting for studying (co)inductive reasoning. In particular, now several type systems based on circular reasoning have been proposed. However, little is known about the complexity theoretic aspects of circular proofs, which exhibit sophisticated loop structures atypical of more common `recursion schemes'. This paper attempts to bridge the gap between circular proofs and implicit computational complexity (ICC). Namely we introduce a circular proof system based on Bellantoni and Cook's famous safe-normal function algebra, and we identify proof theoretical constraints, inspired by ICC, to characterise the polynomial-time and elementary computable functions. Along the way we introduce new recursion theoretic implicit characterisations of these classes that may be of interest in their own right.</description>

      <title>Logical limit laws for Mallows random permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A random permutation $\Pi_n$ of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ follows the $\DeclareMathOperator{\Mallows}{Mallows}\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution with parameter $q&gt;0$ if $\mathbb{P} ( \Pi_n = \pi )$ is proportional to $\DeclareMathOperator{\inv}{inv} q^{\inv(\pi)}$ for all $\pi$. Here $\DeclareMathOperator{\inv}{inv} \inv(\pi) := |\{ i&lt;j : \pi(i)&gt; \pi(j) \}|$ denotes the number of inversions of $\pi$. We consider properties of permutations that can be expressed by the sentences of two different logical languages. Namely, the theory of one bijection ($\mathsf{TOOB}$), which describes permutations via a single binary relation, and the theory of two orders ($\mathsf{TOTO}$), where we describe permutations by two total orders. We say that the convergence law holds with respect to one of these languages if, for every sentence $\phi$ in the language, the probability $\mathbb{P} (\Pi_n\text{ satisfies } \phi)$ converges to a limit as $n\to\infty$. If moreover that limit is in the set $\{0,1\}$ for all sentences, then the zero-one law holds.
  We will show that with respect to $\mathsf{TOOB}$ the $\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution satisfies the zero-one law when $0&lt;q&lt;1$ is fixed, and for fixed $q&gt;1$ the convergence law fails. (In the case when $q=1$ Compton has shown the convergence law holds but not the zero-one law.)
  We will prove that with respect to $\mathsf{TOTO}$ the $\Mallows(n,q)$ distribution satisfies the convergence law but not the zero-one law for any fixed $q\neq 1$, and that if $q=q(n)$ satisfies $1 - 1/\log^*n &lt; q &lt; 1 + 1/\log^*n$ then $\Mallows(n,q)$ fails the convergence law. Here $\log^*$ denotes the discrete inverse of the tower function.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing colorings, proper colorings, and covering properties without the Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work with simple graphs in ZF (Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)) and assume that the sets of colors can be either well-orderable or non-well-orderable to prove that the following statements are equivalent to K\H{o}nig Lemma: (a) Any infinite locally finite connected graph G such that the minimum degree of G is greater than k, has a chromatic number for any fixed integer k greater than or equal to 2. (b) Any infinite locally finite connected graph has a chromatic index. (c) Any infinite locally finite connected graph has a distinguishing number. (d) Any infinite locally finite connected graph has a distinguishing index.
  Our results strengthen some results of Stawiski from a recent paper on the role of the Axiom of Choice in proper and distinguishing colorings since he assumed that the sets of colors can be well-ordered.
  We also formulate new conditions for the existence of irreducible proper coloring, minimal edge cover, maximal matching, and minimal dominating set in connected bipartite graphs and locally finite connected graphs, which are either equivalent to AC or K\H{o}nig Lemma. Moreover, we show that if the Axiom of Choice for families of 2 element sets holds, then the Shelah--Soifer graph has a minimal dominating set.</description>
