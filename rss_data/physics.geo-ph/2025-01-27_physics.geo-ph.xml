      <title>A high-resolution discourse on seismic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and numerical wave simulation have improved tomographic imaging techniques and results, but non-experts may find it difficult to understand which model is best for their needs. This paper is intended for these users. We argue that our notion of best is influenced by the extent to which models satisfy our biases. We explain how the basic types of seismic waves see Earth structure, illustrate the essential strategy of seismic tomography, discuss advanced adaptations such as full-waveform inversion, and emphasize the artistic components of tomography. The compounding effect of a plethora of reasonable, yet subjective choices is a range of models that differ more than their individual uncertainty analyses may suggest. Perhaps counter-intuitively, we argue producing similar tomographic models should not be the goal of seismic tomography. Instead, we promote a Community Monte Carlo effort to assemble a range of dissimilar models based on different modeling approaches and subjective choices, but which explain the seismic data. This effort could serve as input for geodynamic inferences with meaningful seismic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Advancing data-driven broadband seismic wavefield simulation with multi-conditional diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse distributions of seismic sensors and sources pose challenges for subsurface imaging, source characterization, and ground motion modeling. While large-N arrays have shown the potential of dense observational data, their deployment over extensive areas is constrained by economic and logistical limitations. Numerical simulations offer an alternative, but modeling realistic wavefields remains computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we develop a multi-conditional diffusion transformer for generating seismic wavefields without requiring prior geological knowledge. Our method produces high-resolution wavefields that accurately capture both amplitude and phase information across diverse source and station configurations. The model first generates amplitude spectra conditioned on input attributes and subsequently refines wavefields through iterative phase optimization. We validate our approach using data from the Geysers geothermal field, demonstrating the generation of wavefields with spatial continuity and fidelity in both spectral amplitude and phase. These synthesized wavefields hold promise for advancing structural imaging and source characterization in seismology.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Atacama segment of the Chile subduction margin (24{\deg}S-31{\deg}S) with &gt;165,000 earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama segment in Northern Chile (24{\deg}S to 31{\deg}S) is a mature seismic gap with no major event (Mw&gt;8) since 1922. In addition to regular seismicity, around the subducting Copiap\'o ridge, the region hosts seismic swarms, and shallow and deep slow slip events. To characterize the fine structure of this seismic gap and its seismic-aseismic interplay, we instrumented the region with almost 200 seismic and geodetic stations. Using machine learning, we derived a dense, high-resolution seismicity catalog, encompassing over 165,000 events with double-difference relocated hypocenters. Our catalog details the outer rise, interface, intraslab, crustal and mantle wedge seismicity. We infer a detailed slab geometry, showing that the flat slab is dipping towards the south with a narrower extent along dip. The slab geometry controls the intraslab seismicity, with cross-cutting activity in the region of highest bending and a downdip limit around 105 km slab depth. Our catalogue exhibits significant seismicity in the mantle wedge upper corner between 28{\deg}S and 31{\deg}S, highlighting the brittle behavior of the cold nose. On the subduction interface, interplate locking controls the updip end of the seismicity, with seismicity extending closer to the trench in low-locking areas. On fine scales, resolved by relative uncertainties below 50 m, the subduction interface has a complex 3D structure, showing a fractal distribution of seismic patches down to a scale of tens of meters. Our results provide a holistic view of this complex subduction zone, while at the same time giving insights into fine-scale structures and processes.</description>

      <title>Facies Classification with Copula Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose to apply copula entropy (CE) to facies classification. In our method, the correlations between geological variables and facies classes are measured with CE and then the variables associated with large negative CEs are selected for classification. We verified the proposed method on a typical facies dataset for facies classification and the experimental results show that the proposed method can select less geological variables for facies classification without sacrificing classification performance. The geological variables such selected are also interpretable to geologists with geological meanings due to the rigorous definition of CE.</description>
