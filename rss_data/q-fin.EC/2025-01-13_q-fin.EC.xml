      <title>Assessing Co-Authored Papers in Tenure Decisions: Implications for Research Independence and Career Strategies in Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tenure decisions, the treatment of co-authored papers often raises questions about a candidate's research independence. This study examines the effects of solo versus collaborative authorship in high-profile Economics journals on long-term academic success. Our findings confirms the traditional belief that solo-authored publications significantly enhance long-term research output and citation impact compared to collaborative efforts. However, relative to solo-authored papers, international collaborations have a less negative impact on long-term success than national and institutional collaborations. Temporal trends highlight the increasing importance of diverse and international collaborations. These insights provide actionable guidance for tenure committees on evaluating co-authored work and for researchers on optimizing their publication strategies.</description>

      <title>Russian Financial Statements Database: A firm-level collection of the universe of financial statements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Russian Financial Statements Database (RFSD) is an open, harmonized collection of annual unconsolidated financial statements of the universe of Russian firms in 2011-2023. It is the first open data set with information on every active firm in the country, including non-filing firms. With 56.6 million geolocated firm-year observations gathered from two official sources, the RFSD features multiple end-user quality-of-life improvements such as data imputation, statement articulation, harmonization across data providers and formats, and data enrichment. Extensive internal and external validation shows that most statements articulate well while their aggregates display higher correlation with the regional GDP than the previous gridded GDP data products. We also examine the direction and magnitude of the reporting bias by comparing the universe of firms that are required to file with the actual filers. The RFSD can be used in various economic applications as diverse as calibration of micro-founded models, estimation of markups and productivity, or assessing industry organization and market power.</description>

      <title>How Does Artificial Intelligence Improve Human Decision-Making? Evidence from the AI-Powered Go Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how humans learn from AI, leveraging an introduction of an AI-powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the best professional player. We compare the move quality of professional players to APG's superior solutions around its public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates significant improvements in players' move quality, especially in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest. This improvement was accompanied by a higher alignment with AI's suggestions and a decreased number and magnitude of errors. Young players show greater improvement, suggesting potential inequality in learning from AI. Further, while players of all skill levels benefit, less skilled players gain higher marginal benefits. These findings have implications for managers seeking to adopt and utilize AI in their organizations.</description>

      <title>Dissertation Paths: Advisors and Students in the Economics Research Production Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elite economics PhD programs aim to train graduate students for a lifetime of academic research. This paper asks how advising affects graduate students' post-PhD research productivity. Advising is highly concentrated: at the eight highly-selective schools in our study, a minority of advisors do most of the advising work. We quantify advisor attributes such as an advisor's own research output and aspects of the advising relationship like coauthoring and research field affinity that might contribute to student research success. Students advised by research-active, prolific advisors tend to publish more, while coauthoring has no effect. Student-advisor research affinity also predicts student success. But a school-level aggregate production function provides much weaker evidence of causal effects, suggesting that successful advisors attract students likely to succeed-without necessarily boosting their students' chances of success. Evidence for causal effects is strongest for a measure of advisors' own research output. Aggregate student research output appears to scale linearly with graduate student enrollment, with no evidence of negative class-size effects. An analysis of gender differences in research output shows male and female graduate students to be equally productive in the first few years post-PhD, but female productivity peaks sooner than male productivity.</description>
