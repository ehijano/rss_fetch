      <title>Multiscale risk spillovers and external driving factors: Evidence from the global futures and spot markets of staple foods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stable and efficient food markets are crucial for global food security, yet international staple food markets are increasingly exposed to complex risks, including intensified risk contagion and escalating external uncertainties. This paper systematically investigates risk spillovers in global staple food markets and explores the key determinants of these spillover effects, combining innovative decomposition-reconstruction techniques, risk connectedness analysis, and random forest models. The findings reveal that short-term components exhibit the highest volatility, with futures components generally more volatile than spot components. Further analysis identifies two main risk transmission patterns, namely cross-grain and cross-timescale transmission, and clarifies the distinct roles of each component in various net risk spillover networks. Additionally, price drivers, external uncertainties, and core supply-demand indicators significantly influence these spillover effects, with heterogeneous importance of varying factors in explaining different risk spillovers. This study provides valuable insights into the risk dynamics of staple food markets, offers evidence-based guidance for policymakers and market participants to enhance risk warning and mitigation efforts, and supports the stabilization of international food markets and the safeguarding of global food security.</description>

      <title>Influence Function: Local Robustness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a direct approach to calculating influence functions based on the concept of functional derivatives. The relative simplicity of our direct method is demonstrated through well-known examples. Using influence functions as a key device, we examine the connection and difference between local robustness and efficiency in both joint and sequential identification/estimation procedures. We show that the joint procedure is associated with efficiency, while the sequential procedure is linked to local robustness. Furthermore, we provide conditions that are theoretically verifiable and empirically testable on when efficient and locally robust estimation for the parameter of interest in a semiparametric model can be achieved simultaneously. In addition, we present straightforward conditions for an adaptive procedure in the presence of nuisance parameters.</description>

      <title>A General Approach to Relaxing Unconfoundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines a general class of relaxations of the unconfoundedness assumption. This class includes several previous approaches as special cases, including the marginal sensitivity model of Tan (2006). This class therefore allows us to precisely compare and contrast these previously disparate relaxations. We use this class to derive a variety of new identification results which can be used to assess sensitivity to unconfoundedness. In particular, the prior literature focuses on average parameters, like the average treatment effect (ATE). We move beyond averages by providing sharp bounds for a large class of parameters, including both the quantile treatment effect (QTE) and the distribution of treatment effects (DTE), results which were previously unknown even for the marginal sensitivity model.</description>

      <title>Simple Inference on a Simplex-Valued Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, the parameter of interest involves a simplex-valued weight which is identified as a solution to an optimization problem. Examples include synthetic control methods with group-level weights and various methods of model averaging and forecast combination. The simplex constraint on the weight poses a challenge in statistical inference due to the constraint potentially binding. In this paper, we propose a simple method of constructing a confidence set for the weight and prove that the method is asymptotically uniformly valid. The procedure does not require tuning parameters or simulations to compute critical values. The confidence set accommodates both the cases of point-identification or set-identification of the weight. We illustrate the method with an empirical example.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantile Factor Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a factor model and an estimator of the factors and loadings that are robust to weak factors. The factors can have an arbitrarily weak influence on the mean or quantile of the outcome variable at most quantile levels; each factor only needs to have a strong impact on the outcome's quantile near one unknown quantile level. The estimator for every factor, loading, and common component is asymptotically normal at the $\sqrt{N}$ or $\sqrt{T}$ rate. It does not require the knowledge of whether the factors are weak and how weak they are. We also develop a weak-factor-robust estimator of the number of factors and a consistent selectors of factors of any desired strength of influence on the quantile or mean of the outcome variable. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Advancing Portfolio Optimization: Adaptive Minimum-Variance Portfolios and Minimum Risk Rate Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the Adaptive Minimum-Variance Portfolio (AMVP) framework and the Adaptive Minimum-Risk Rate (AMRR) metric, innovative tools designed to optimize portfolios dynamically in volatile and nonstationary financial markets. Unlike traditional minimum-variance approaches, the AMVP framework incorporates real-time adaptability through advanced econometric models, including ARFIMA-FIGARCH processes and non-Gaussian innovations. Empirical applications on cryptocurrency and equity markets demonstrate the proposed framework's superior performance in risk reduction and portfolio stability, particularly during periods of structural market breaks and heightened volatility. The findings highlight the practical implications of using the AMVP and AMRR methodologies to address modern investment challenges, offering actionable insights for portfolio managers navigating uncertain and rapidly changing market conditions.</description>

      <title>Copyright and Competition: Estimating Supply and Demand with Unstructured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copyright policies play a pivotal role in protecting the intellectual property of creators and companies in creative industries. The advent of cost-reducing technologies, such as generative AI, in these industries calls for renewed attention to the role of these policies. This paper studies product positioning and competition in a market of creatively differentiated products and the competitive and welfare effects of copyright protection. A common feature of products with creative elements is that their key attributes (e.g., images and text) are unstructured and thus high-dimensional. We focus on a stylized design product, fonts, and use data from the world's largest online marketplace for fonts. We use neural network embeddings to quantify unstructured attributes and measure the visual similarity. We show that this measure closely aligns with actual human perception. Based on this measure, we empirically find that competitions occur locally in the visual characteristics space. We then develop a structural model for supply and demand that integrate the embeddings. Through counterfactual analyses, we find that local copyright protection can enhance consumer welfare when products are relocated, and the interplay between copyright and cost-reducing technologies is essential in determining an optimal policy for social welfare. We believe that the embedding analysis and empirical models introduced in this paper can be applicable to a range of industries where unstructured data captures essential features of products and markets.</description>

      <title>Detecting Sparse Cointegration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-step procedure to detect cointegration in high-dimensional settings, focusing on sparse relationships. First, we use the adaptive LASSO to identify the small subset of integrated covariates driving the equilibrium relationship with a target series, ensuring model-selection consistency. Second, we adopt an information-theoretic model choice criterion to distinguish between stationarity and nonstationarity in the resulting residuals, avoiding dependence on asymptotic distributional assumptions. Monte Carlo experiments confirm robust finite-sample performance, even under endogeneity and serial correlation.</description>

      <title>Scale-Insensitive Neural Network Significance Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a scale-insensitive framework for neural network significance testing, substantially generalizing existing approaches through three key innovations. First, we replace metric entropy calculations with Rademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without requiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we weaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev space membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s &gt; d/2$, significantly relaxing previous smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates. Third, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds rather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework for modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations while preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic distributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines localization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive complexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz activation functions. This framework better aligns theoretical guarantees with contemporary deep learning practice while maintaining mathematical rigor.</description>

      <title>Identification of Treatment Effects under Limited Exogenous Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multidimensional heterogeneity and endogeneity are important features of a wide class of econometric models. With control variables to correct for endogeneity, nonparametric identification of treatment effects requires strong support conditions. To alleviate this requirement, we consider varying coefficients specifications for the conditional expectation function of the outcome given a treatment and control variables. This function is expressed as a linear combination of either known functions of the treatment, with unknown coefficients varying with the controls, or known functions of the controls, with unknown coefficients varying with the treatment. We use this modeling approach to give necessary and sufficient conditions for identification of average treatment effects. A sufficient condition for identification is conditional nonsingularity, that the second moment matrix of the known functions given the variable in the varying coefficients is nonsingular with probability one. For known treatment functions with sufficient variation, we find that triangular models with discrete instrument cannot identify average treatment effects when the number of support points for the instrument is less than the number of coefficients. For known functions of the controls, we find that average treatment effects can be identified in general nonseparable triangular models with binary or discrete instruments. We extend our analysis to flexible models of increasing dimension and relate conditional nonsingularity to the full support condition of Imbens and Newey (2009), thereby embedding semi- and non-parametric identification into a common framework.</description>

      <title>Non-Robustness of the Cluster-Robust Inference: with a Proposal of a New Robust Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional cluster-robust (CR) standard errors may not be robust. They are vulnerable to data that contain a small number of large clusters. When a researcher uses the 51 states in the U.S. as clusters, the largest cluster (California) consists of about 10% of the total sample. Such a case in fact violates the assumptions under which the widely used CR methods are guaranteed to work. We formally show that the conventional CR methods fail if the distribution of cluster sizes follows a power law with exponent less than two. Besides the example of 51 state clusters, some examples are drawn from a list of recent original research articles published in a top journal. In light of these negative results about the existing CR methods, we propose a weighted CR (WCR) method as a simple fix. Simulation studies support our arguments that the WCR method is robust while the conventional CR methods are not.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many situations, researchers are interested in identifying dynamic effects of an irreversible treatment with a time-invariant binary instrumental variable (IV). For example, in evaluations of dynamic effects of training programs with a single lottery determining eligibility. A common approach in these situations is to report per-period IV estimates. Under a dynamic extension of standard IV assumptions, we show that such IV estimands identify a weighted sum of treatment effects for different latent groups and treatment exposures. However, there is possibility of negative weights. We discuss point and partial identification of dynamic treatment effects in this setting under different sets of assumptions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Decomposition for Counterfactual Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counterfactual predictions are challenging when the policy variable goes beyond its pre-policy support. However, in many cases, information about the policy of interest is available from different ("source") regions where a similar policy has already been implemented. In this paper, we propose a novel method of using such data from source regions to predict a new policy in a target region. Instead of relying on extrapolation of a structural relationship using a parametric specification, we formulate a transferability condition and construct a synthetic outcome-policy relationship such that it is as close as possible to meeting the condition. The synthetic relationship weighs both the similarity in distributions of observables and in structural relationships. We develop a general procedure to construct asymptotic confidence intervals for counterfactual predictions and prove its asymptotic validity. We then apply our proposal to predict average teenage employment in Texas following a counterfactual increase in the minimum wage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of treatment effects from a sample that is stratified on the binary treatment status. In the case of unconfounded assignment where the potential outcomes are independent of the treatment given covariates, we show that standard estimators of the average treatment effect are inconsistent. In the case of an endogenous treatment and a binary instrument, we show that the IV estimator is inconsistent for the local average treatment effect. In both cases, we propose simple alternative estimators that are consistent in stratified samples, assuming that the fraction treated in the population is known or can be estimated.</description>

      <title>A Note on Doubly Robust Estimator in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. RD designs provide a quasi-experimental framework for estimating treatment effects, where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is the use of nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. However, the validity of these methods still relies on the consistency of the nonparametric estimators. In this study, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. The primary advantage of the DR-RD estimator lies in its ability to ensure the consistency of the treatment effect estimation as long as at least one of the two estimators is consistent. Consequently, our DR-RD estimator enhances robustness of treatment effect estimators in RD designs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neyman Allocation for Locally Minimax Optimal Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically locally minimax optimal algorithm for fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI). We propose the Generalized Neyman Allocation (GNA) algorithm and demonstrate that its worst-case upper bound on the probability of misidentifying the best arm aligns with the worst-case lower bound under the small-gap regime, where the gap between the expected outcomes of the best and suboptimal arms is small. Our lower and upper bounds are tight, matching exactly including constant terms within the small-gap regime. The GNA algorithm generalizes the Neyman allocation for two-armed bandits (Neyman, 1934; Kaufmann et al., 2016) and refines existing BAI algorithms, such as those proposed by Glynn &amp; Juneja (2004). By proposing an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm, we address the longstanding open issue in BAI (Kaufmann, 2020) and treatment choice (Kasy &amp; Sautmann, 202) by restricting a class of distributions to the small-gap regimes.</description>
