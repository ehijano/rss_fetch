      <title>Function approximations for counterparty credit exposure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge to measure exposures regularly forces financial institutions into a choice between an overwhelming computational burden or oversimplification of risk. To resolve this unsettling dilemma, we systematically investigate replacing frequently called derivative pricers by function approximations covering all practically relevant exposure measures, including quantiles. We prove error bounds for exposure measures in terms of the $L^p$ norm, $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$, and for the uniform norm. To fully exploit these results, we employ the Chebyshev interpolation and show exponential convergence of the resulting exposure calculations. As our main result we derive probabilistic and finite sample error bounds under mild conditions including the natural case of unbounded risk factors. We derive an asymptotic efficiency gain scaling with $n^{1/2-\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ with $n$ the number of simulations. Our numerical experiments cover callable, barrier, stochastic volatility and jump features. Using 10\,000 simulations, we consistently observe significant run-time reductions in all cases with speed-up factors up to 230, and an average speed-up of 87. We also present an adaptive choice of the interpolation degree. Finally, numerical examples relying on the approximation of Greeks highlight the merit of the method beyond the presented theory.</description>

      <title>Joint deep calibration of the 4-factor PDV model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint calibration to SPX and VIX market data is a delicate task that requires sophisticated modeling and incurs significant computational costs. The latter is especially true when pricing of volatility derivatives hinges on nested Monte Carlo simulation. One such example is the 4-factor Markov Path-Dependent Volatility (PDV) model of Guyon and Lekeufack (2023). Nonetheless, its realism has earned it considerable attention in recent years. Gazzani and Guyon (2025) marked a relevant contribution by learning the VIX as a random variable, i.e., a measurable function of the model parameters and the Markovian factors. A neural network replaces the inner simulation and makes the joint calibration problem accessible. However, the minimization loop remains slow due to expensive outer simulation. The present paper overcomes this limitation by learning SPX implied volatilities, VIX futures, and VIX call option prices. The pricing functions reduce to simple matrix-vector products that can be evaluated on the fly, shrinking calibration times to just a few seconds.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Trading Performance Through Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models: Evidence from the S&amp;P 500</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study integrates real-time sentiment analysis from financial news, GPT-2 and FinBERT, with technical indicators and time-series models like ARIMA and ETS to optimize S&amp;P 500 trading strategies. By merging sentiment data with momentum and trend-based metrics, including a benchmark buy-and-hold and sentiment-based approach, is evaluated through assets values and returns. Results show that combining sentiment-driven insights with traditional models improves trading performance, offering a more dynamic approach to stock trading that adapts to market changes in volatile environments.</description>

      <title>Towards Realistic and Interpretable Market Simulations: Factorizing Financial Power Law using Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms behind the power-law distribution of stock returns using artificial market simulations. While traditional financial theory assumes Gaussian price fluctuations, empirical studies consistently show that the tails of return distributions follow a power law. Previous research has proposed hypotheses for this phenomenon -- some attributing it to investor behavior, others to institutional demand imbalances. However, these factors have rarely been modeled together to assess their individual and joint contributions. The complexity of real financial markets complicates the isolation of the contribution of a single component using existing data. To address this, we construct artificial markets and conduct controlled experiments using optimal transport (OT) as a quantitative similarity measure. Our proposed framework incrementally introduces behavioral components into the agent models, allowing us to compare each simulation output with empirical data via OT distances. The results highlight that informational effect of prices plays a dominant role in reproducing power-law behavior and that multiple components interact synergistically to amplify this effect.</description>

      <title>NMIXX: Domain-Adapted Neural Embeddings for Cross-Lingual eXploration of Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.</description>
