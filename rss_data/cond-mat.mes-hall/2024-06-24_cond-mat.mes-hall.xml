      <title>Minimal Model for Chirally Induced Spin Selectivity: Chirality, Spin-orbit coupling, Decoherence and Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we review a universal model for chirally induced spin-selectivity (CISS) as a standalone effect occurring in chiral molecules. We tie together the results of forward scattering in the gas phase to the results for photoelectrons in chiral self-assembled monolayers and the more contemporary results in two terminal transport setups. We discuss the ingredients that are necessarily present in all experiments to date, which we identify as: i) chirality, be it point, helical or configurational, ii) the spin-orbit coupling as the spin active coupling of atomic origin, iii) decoherence as a time-reversal symmetry breaking mechanism that avoids reciprocity relations in the linear regime and finally iv) tunneling that accounts for the magnitude of the spin polarization effect. This proposal does not discard other mechanisms that can yield comparable spin effects related to interactions of the molecule to contacts or substrates that have been proposed but that are less universal or apply to particular situations. Finally, we discuss recent results suggesting CISS as a molecular phenomenon in the real of enantiomer selectivity, coherent electron transfer, and spin effects in chiroptical activity.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian spin Hall insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a recent experiment reporting the fractional quantum spin Hall effect in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$, we investigate microscopically the prospects of realizing exotic topologically ordered states beyond conventional quantum Hall physics. We show that a non-Abelian spin Hall insulator, a state of two copies of the non-Abelian Moore-Read state, can be stabilized at half filling of time-reversal conjugate Chern bands. We elucidate that the existence of this phase relies on the reduction of opposite-spin interactions at short distances to overcome the Ising ferromagnetism. Moreover, we demonstrate that band mixing provides a generic mechanism for this reduction to be achieved. Quite remarkably, we find that a renormalization of opposite-spin interactions at short distances as small as 15 % of the moir\'e period is sufficient for a direct transition to a completely spin unpolarized phase which supports the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator. Furthermore, we show that the non-Abelian spin Hall insulator can either break time-reversal symmetry or preserve it depending on the underlying topological order.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in Quantum Kirigamis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in engineering mesoscopic quantum devices have led to new material platforms where electronic transport can be achieved on foldable structures. In this respect, we study quantum phases and their transitions on a Kirigami structure, a Japanese craft form, where its individual building blocks are topologically non-trivial. In particular, we find that by mechanically deforming the Kirigami structure one can engineer topological phase transitions in the system. Using a multipronged approach, we show that the physics of the system can be captured within a transfer matrix formalism akin to Chalker-Coddington networks, where the junctions describe scattering between effective non-Hermitian one-dimensional edge channels. We further show that the nature of the Kirigami structure can affect the critical folding angles where the topological phase transitions occur. Our study shows the rich interplay between topological quantum phenomena and structural configuration of an underlying Kirigami network reflecting its potential as an intriguing platform.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale defects as probes of time reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale defects such as Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers can serve as sensitive and non-invasive probes of electromagnetic fields and fluctuations from materials, which in turn can be used to characterize these systems. Here we specifically discuss how NV centers can directly probe time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) phenomena in low-dimensional conductors and magnetic insulators. We argue that the relaxation rate of NV centers can vary dramatically depending on whether its magnetic dipole points towards or away from the TRSB material. This effect arises from the difference in the fluctuation spectrum of left and right-polarized magnetic fields emanating from such materials. It is perhaps most dramatic in the quantum Hall setting where the NV center may experience no additional contribution to its relaxation due to the presence of the material when initialized in a particular spin state but a large decay rate when initialized in the opposite spin state. More generally, we show that the NV center relaxation rate is sensitive to the imaginary part of the wave-vector dependent Hall conductivity of a TRSB material. We argue that this can be used to determine the Hall viscosity, which can potentially distinguish candidate fractional quantum Hall states and pairing angular momentum in TRSB chiral superconductors. We also consider Wigner crystals realized in systems with large Berry curvature and discuss how the latter may be extracted from NV center relaxometry.</description>

      <title>Controllable photocurrent generation in Dirac systems with two frequency drives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in Dirac and Weyl semimetals under two-frequency light irradiation. We show that the BPVE emerges for centrosymmetric Dirac and Weyl semimetals in the presence of light fields with frequencies $\Omega$ and $2\Omega$. The BPVE under the two frequency drive involves both shift current contribution independent of the carriers lifetime $\tau$ and the injection current contribution $\propto \tau$. Our calculations indicate that the photocurrent's direction, magnitude and type can be dynamically controlled by tuning parameters of the driving fields. Furthermore, we find that the tilt of the Dirac cone significantly affects the photocurrent, particularly in mirror symmetry-lacking Weyl semimetals, leading to an anisotropic optical response. These findings provide new insights into the dynamic control of photocurrents in topological semimetals, offering promising applications for optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Models for Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity in Electron Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first microscopic model for chirality-induced spin selectivity effect in electron-transfer, in which the internal degrees of freedom of the chiral bridge are explicitly included. By exactly solving this model on short chiral chains we demonstrate that a sizable polarization on the acceptor arises from the interplay of coherent and incoherent dynamics, with strong electron-electron correlations yielding many-body states on the bridge as crucial ingredients. Moreover, we include the coherent and incoherent interactions with vibrational modes and show that they can play an important role in determining the long-time polarized state probed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance oscillations induced by geometry in a two-dimensional quantum ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of a controlled conical geometry on the electric charge transport through a two-dimensional quantum ring weakly coupled to both the emitter and the collector. These mesoscopic systems are known for being able to confine highly mobile electrons in a defined region of matter. Particularly, we consider a GaAs device having an average radius of $800\hspace{0.05cm}\text{nm}$ in different regimes of subband occupation at non-zero temperature and under the influence of a weak and uniform background magnetic field. Using the adapted Landauer formula for the resonant tunneling and the energy eigenvalues, we explore how the modified surface affects the Van-Hoove conductance singularities and the magnetoresistance interference patterns resulting from the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of different frequencies. Magnetoresistance oscillations depending only on the curvature intensity are reported, providing a new feature that represents an alternative way to optimize the transport through the device by tuning its geometry.</description>

      <title>Theory of coherent phonons coupled to excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of excitons with lattice vibrations underlies the scattering from bright to dark excitons as well as the coherent modulation of the exciton energy. Unlike the former mechanism, which involves phonons with finite momentum, the latter can be exclusively attributed to {\it coherent phonons} with zero momentum. We here lay down the microscopic theory of coherent phonons interacting with resonantly pumped bright excitons and provide the explicit expression of the corresponding coupling. The coupling notably resembles the exciton-phonon one, but with a crucial distinction: it contains the bare electron-phonon matrix elements rather than the screened ones. Our theory predicts that the exciton energy features a polaronic-like red-shift and monochromatic oscillations or beatings, depending on the number of coupled optical modes. Both the red-shift and the amplitude of the oscillations are proportional to the excitation density and to the square of the exciton-coherent-phonon coupling. We validate our analytical findings through comparisons with numerical simulations of time-resolved optical absorbance in resonantly pumped MoS$_{2}$ monolayers.</description>

      <title>Phase distribution in 1D localization and phase transitions in single-mode waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of electrons in 1D disordered systems is usually described in the random phase approximation, when distributions of phases \varphi and \theta, entering the transfer matrix, are considered as uniform. In the general case, the random phase approximation is violated, and the evolution equations (when the system length L is increased) contain three independent variables, i.e. the Landauer resistance \rho and the combined phases \psi=\theta-\varphi and \chi=\theta+\varphi. The phase \chi does not affect the evolution of \rho and was not considered in previous papers. The distribution of the phase \psi is found to exhibit an unusual phase transition at the point E_0 when changing the electron energy E, which manifests itself in the appearance of the imaginary part of \psi. The distribution of resistance P(\rho) has no singularity at the point E_0, and the transition looks unobservable in the electron disordered systems. However, the theory of 1D localization is immediately applicable to propagation of waves in single-mode optical waveguides. The optical methods are more efficient and provide possibility to measure phases \psi and \chi. On the one hand, it makes observable the phase transition in the distribution P(\psi), which can be considered as a 'trace' of the mobility edge remaining in 1D systems. On the other hand, observability of the phase \chi makes actual derivation of its evolution equation, which is presented below. Relaxation of the distribution P(\chi) to the limiting distribution P_\infty(\chi) at L\to\infty is described by two exponents, whose exponentials have jumps of the second derivative, when the energy E is changed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear photomagnetization is a process by which an oscillating electric field can induce a static magnetization. We show that all 32 crystallographic point groups admit spin polarization to second order using circularly polarized electric fields (as in the usual spin orientation) but only 29 points groups admit spin polarization to second order using linearly polarized electric fields. The excluded point groups are the highly symmetric $m$-3$m$, -$43m$ and 432. To illustrate our results, we compute the second order electric spin susceptibility of Te, Se, SnS$_2$, GaAs, InSb and Si using density functional theory which corresponds to nonmagnetic materials with and without inversion symmetry. We show that our nonlinear photomagnetization can reach magnetic moments of 0.39 $\mu_B/\text{atom}$ comparable to those of naturally occurring ferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Fano-enhanced low-loss on-chip superconducting microwave circulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferrite-free circulators that are passive and readily integratable on a chip are highly sought-after in quantum technologies based on superconducting circuits. In our previous work, we implemented such a circulator using a three-Josephson-junction loop that exhibited unambiguous nonreciprocity and signal circulation, but required junction energies to be within $1\%$ of design values. This tolerance is tighter than standard junction fabrication methods provide, so we propose and demonstrate a design improvement that relaxes the required junction fabrication precision, allowing for higher device performance and fabrication yield. Specifically, we introduce large direct capacitive couplings between the waveguides to create strong Fano scattering interference. We measure enhanced `circulation fidelity' above $97\%$, with optimised on-resonance insertion loss of $0.2$~dB, isolation of $18$~dB, and power reflectance of $-15$~dB, in good agreement with model calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum system consisting of a magnetic particle inductively coupled to two superconducting transmon qubits, where qubit-qubit interactions are mediated via magnons. We show that the system can be tuned into three different regimes of effective qubit-qubit interactions, namely a transverse ($XX + YY$), a longitudinal ($ZZ$) and a non-trivial $ZX$ interaction. In addition, we show that an enhanced coupling can be achieved by employing an ellipsoidal magnet, carrying anisotropic magnetic fluctuations. We propose a scheme for realizing two-qubit gates, and simulate their performance under realistic experimental conditions. We find that iSWAP and CZ gates can be performed in this setup with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 99 \% $ , while an iCNOT gate can be applied with an average fidelity $\gtrsim 88 \%$. Our proposed hybrid circuit architecture offers an alternative platform for realizing two-qubit gates between superconducting qubits and could be employed for constructing qubit networks using magnons as mediators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are proposing a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor platform using indium arsenide (InAs) grown on an insulating layer of indium aluminum arsenide (InAlAs) heterostructure (InAsOI) as an ideal candidate for coherent caloritronic devices. These devices aim to heat or cool electrons out of equilibrium with respect to the phonon degree of freedom. However, their performances are usually limited by the strength of the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and the associated power loss. Our work discusses the advantages of the InAsOI platform, which are based on the significantly low e-ph coupling measured compared to all-metallic state-of-the-art caloritronic devices. Our structure demonstrates values of the e-ph coupling constant up to two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values in metallic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT), an experimental and theoretical study of changes in the electronic structure (dispersion dependencies) and corresponding modification of the energy band gap at the Dirac point (DP) for topological insulator (TI) $\mathrm{Mn}_{1-x} \mathrm{Ge}_x \mathrm{Bi}_2 \mathrm{Te}_4$ have been carried out with gradual replacement of magnetic Mn atoms by non-magnetic Ge atoms when concentration of the latter was varied from 10$\%$ to 75$\%$. It was shown that when Ge concentration increases then the bulk band gap decreases and reaches zero plateau in the concentration range of 45$\%$-60$\%$ while non-topological surface states (TSS) are present and exhibit an energy splitting of 100 and 70 meV in different types of measurements. It was also shown that TSS disappear from the measured band dispersions at a Ge concentration of about 40$\%$. DFT calculations of $\mathrm{Mn}_{1-x} \mathrm{Ge}_x \mathrm{Bi}_2 \mathrm{Te}_4$ band structure were carried out to identify the nature of observed band dispersion features and to analyze a possibility of magnetic Weyl semimetal state formation in this system. These calculations were performed for both antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) ordering types while the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength was varied or a strain (compression or tension) along the $c$-axis was applied. Calculations show that two different series of topological phase transitions (TPTs) may be implemented in this system depending on the magnetic ordering. At AFM ordering transition between TI and trivial insulator phase goes through the Dirac semimetal state, whereas for FM phase such route admits three intermediate states instead of one (TI - Dirac semimetal - Weyl semimetal - Dirac semimetal - trivial insulator).</description>

Realizing the proposed system as an array of high-index ceramic resonators working at GHz frequencies, we numerically and experimentally demonstrate the presence of edge states at the interface between two domains with opposite orientations of the bianisotropic resonators as well as at the boundary between a single domain and free space. For both cases, we characterize the dispersion of edge states, examine their propagation along sharp bends, their resilience towards various types of geometrical defects, and a spin-momentum locked unidirectional propagation in the case of circularly polarized excitation. The considered design opens novel possibilities in constructing optical and microwave structures simultaneously featuring edge states at the interfaces between distinct resonator domains or a resonator domain and free space.</description>

      <title>Tailored topotactic chemistry unlocks heterostructures of magnetic intercalation compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of thin film heterostructures has been a widely successful archetype for fabricating materials with emergent physical properties. This strategy is of particular importance for the design of multilayer magnetic architectures in which direct interfacial spin--spin interactions between magnetic phases in dissimilar layers lead to emergent and controllable magnetic behavior. However, crystallographic incommensurability and atomic-scale interfacial disorder can severely limit the types of materials amenable to this strategy, as well as the performance of these systems. Here, we demonstrate a method for synthesizing heterostructures comprising magnetic intercalation compounds of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), through directed topotactic reaction of the TMD with a metal oxide. The mechanism of the intercalation reaction enables thermally initiated intercalation of the TMD from lithographically patterned oxide films, giving access to a new family of multi-component magnetic architectures through the combination of deterministic van der Waals assembly and directed intercalation chemistry.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-controlled SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 magnetic tunnel junctions:Spin polarization and its relevance to tunneling magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), that consist of two ferromagnetic electrodes separated by an insulating barrier layer, have non-trivial fundamental properties associated with spin-dependent tunneling. Especially interesting are fully crystalline MTJs where spin-dependent tunneling is controlled by the symmetry group of wave vector. In this work, using first-principles quantum-transport calculations, we explore spin-dependent tunneling in fully crystalline SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 (001) MTJs and predict tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) of nearly 3000%. We demonstrate that this giant TMR effect is driven by symmetry matching (mismatching) of the incoming and outcoming Bloch states in the SrRuO3 (001) electrodes and evanescent states in the SrTiO3 (001) barrier. We argue that under the conditions of symmetry-controlled transport, spin polarization, whatever definition is used, is not a relevant measure of spin-dependent tunneling. In the presence of diffuse scattering, however, e.g. due to localized states in the band gap of the tunnel barrier, symmetry matching is no longer valid and TMR in SrRuO3/SrTiO3/SrRuO3 (001) MTJs is strongly reduced. Under these conditions, the spin polarization of the interface transmission function becomes a valid measure of TMR. These results provide an important insight into understanding and optimizing TMR in all-oxide MTJs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the phase diagrams of moir\'e materials in search of a new class of intervalley-coherent correlated insulating state: the Chern texture insulator (CTI). This phase of matter, proposed in a companion paper, breaks valley $U(1)$ symmetry in a nontrivial fashion wherein the valley order parameter is forced to texture in momentum space as a consequence of band topology. Using detailed Hartree-Fock studies, we establish that the CTI emerges as an energetically competitive intermediate-coupling ground state in several moir\'e systems which lack a twofold rotation symmetry that forbids the single-particle topology essential to the formation of the CTI valley texture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study new interacting topological states that arise in time-reversal symmetric bands with an underlying obstruction to forming localized states. If the $U(1)$ valley symmetry linked to independent charge conservation in each time-reversal sector is spontaneously broken, the corresponding `excitonic' order parameter is forced to form a topologically non-trivial texture across the Brillouin zone. We show that the resulting phase, which we dub a textured exciton insulator, cannot be given a local-moment description due to a form of delicate topology. Using toy models of bands with Chern or Euler obstructions to localization we construct explicit examples of the Chern or Euler texture insulators (CTIs or ETIs) they support, and demonstrate that these are generically competitive ground states at intermediate coupling. We construct field theories that capture the response properties of these new states. Finally, we identify the incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral phase observed in magic-angle bi- and trilayer graphene as a concrete realization of an ETI.</description>

      <title>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We apply the BdG formalism to compute the wavefunctions of the subgap Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit, in a piecewise-continuous manner. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result is different from the S-B-S set-ups in graphene and Weyl semimetals (each featuring twofold-degenerate nodal points), where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. Although the three bands of the triple-point fermions comprise a nondispersive flat band, the multifold nature of the bandstructure is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction, contributed by the two pairs of ABSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04789v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a phase-biased non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) composed of two superconductors mediated by a short non-Hermitian link. Such a NHJJ is described by an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian derived based on the Lindblad formalism in the weak coupling regime. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we find that its Andreev spectrum as a function of phase difference exhibits Josephson gaps, i.e., finite phase windows with no Andreev (quasi)bound states. The complex Andreev spectrum and the presence of Josephson gaps constitute particular spectral features of the NHJJ. Moreover, we propose complex supercurrents arising from inelastic Cooper pair tunneling to characterize the anomalous transport in the NHJJ. Additional numerical simulations complement our analytical predictions. We demonstrate that the Josephson effect is strongly affected by non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the observation of Coulomb drag between graphene-hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) moir\'{e} heterostructure with a moir\'{e} wavelength of $\sim$14 nm and an intrinsic graphene with a lattice constant of $\sim$0.25 nm. By tuning carrier densities of each graphene layer independently, we find that the charge carriers in moir\'{e} mini-bands, i.e., near the satellite Dirac point (sDP), can be coupled with the massless Fermions near the original Dirac point (oDP), strongly enough to generate a finite drag resistivity. At high temperature ($T$) and large density ($n$), the drag resistivities near both oDP and sDP follow a typical $n^{-\alpha}$ ($\alpha=1.3\sim1.7$) and $T^2$ power law dependence as expected for the momentum transfer process and it also satisfies the layer reciprocity. In contrast, at low $T$, the layer reciprocity is broken in both oDP-oDP and sDP-oDP coupled regions that suggest dominant energy drag. Furthermore, quantitatively, the drag resistivities near sDPs are smaller than those near oDP and they deviate from $T^2$ dependence below $\sim$100 K. These results suggest that the coupling between the carriers in moir\'{e} mini-bands and those in original Dirac bands may not be of a simple Fermi liquid nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for nonlinear optical response of moir\'e exciton-polaritons in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our theory allows to study the tunnel-coupled intralayer and interlayer excitonic modes for a wide range of twist angles ($\theta$), external electric field, and light-matter coupling, providing insights into the hybridization regime inaccessible before. Specifically, we account for the Umklapp scattering processes of two exciton-polaritons responsible for enhanced nonlinearity, and show that it is crucial for describing interactions at strong hybridization. We reveal a regime of attractive nonlinearity for moir\'e polaritons, stemming from the anisotropic Coulomb interactions, which can explain some of experimental features of optical response in TMD bilayers. Furthermore, within our theory we demonstrate that the attractive nonlinearity can be tuned into repulsive by applying an external electric field. Our findings show that nonlinear moir\'e polaritons offer a controllable platform nonlinear polaritonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of energy transfer between two nanocrystal quantum dots placed within an optical microcavity. By adjusting the coupling strength between the cavity photon mode and the quantum dots, we have the capacity to fine-tune the effective coupling between the donor and acceptor. Introducing a nonadiabatic parameter, $\gamma$, governed by the coupling to the cavity mode, we demonstrate the system's capability to shift from the overdamped Forster regime ($\gamma \ll 1$) to an underdamped coherent regime ($\gamma \gg 1$). In the latter regime, characterized by swift energy transfer rates, the dynamics are influenced by decoherence times. To illustrate this, we study the exciton energy transfer dynamics between two closely positioned CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots with sizes and separations relevant to experimental conditions. Employing an atomistic approach, we calculate the excitonic level arrangement, exciton-phonon interactions, and transition dipole moments of the quantum dots within the microcavity. These parameters are then utilized to define a model Hamiltonian. Subsequently, we apply a generalized non-Markovian quantum Redfield equation to delineate the dynamics within the polaritonic framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents two methods for topological analysis of the complex Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model using the quantum geometric tensor: Berry phase and topological data analysis. We demonstrate how both methods can effectively generate topological phase diagrams for the model, revealing two distinct regions based on the relative magnitudes of the parameters $|v|$ and $|w|$. Specifically, when $|v| &gt; |w|$, the system is found to be topologically trivial, whereas for $|v| &lt; |w|$, it exhibits topologically non-trivial behavior. Our results contribute to building the groundwork for topological analysis of more complicated SSH-type models.</description>

Abstract: Realizing nonabelian topological orders and their anyon excitations is an esteemed objective. In this work, we propose a novel approach towards this goal: quantum simulating topological orders in the doubled Hilbert space - the space of density matrices. We show that ground states of all quantum double models (toric code being the simplest example) can be efficiently prepared in the doubled Hilbert space; only finite-depth local operations are needed. In contrast, this is not the case in the conventional Hilbert space: Ground states of only some of these models are known to be efficiently preparable. Additionally, we find that nontrivial anyon braiding effects, both abelian and nonabelian, can be realized in the doubled Hilbert space, although the intrinsic nature of density matrices restricts possible excitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for materials with large thermopower is of great practical interest. Dirac and Weyl semimetals have recently proven to exhibit superior thermoelectric properties, particularly when subjected to a quantizing magnetic field. Here we consider whether a similar enhancement arises in nodal line semimetals, for which the conduction and valence band meet at a line or ring in momentum space. We compute the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients for arbitrary temperature and magnetic field and we find a wealth of different scaling regimes. Most strikingly, when a sufficiently strong magnetic field is applied along the direction of a straight nodal line or in the plane of a nodal ring, the large degeneracy of states leads to a large, linear-in-$B$ thermopower that is temperature-independent even at low temperatures. Our results suggest that nodal line semimetals may offer significant opportunity for efficient, low-temperature thermoelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity enables macroscopic accumulation of bulk states, named non-Hermitian skin effects. The non-Hermitian skin effects are well-established for single-particle systems, but their proper characterization for general systems is elusive. Here, we propose a general criterion of non-Hermitian skin effects, which works for any finite-dimensional system evolved by a linear operator. The applicable systems include many-body systems and network systems. A system meeting the criterion exhibits enhanced non-normality of the evolution operator, accompanied by exceptional characteristics intrinsic to non-Hermitian systems. Applying the criterion, we discover a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect in many-body systems, which we dub the Fock space skin effect. We also discuss the Fock space skin effect-induced slow dynamics, which gives an experimental signal for the Fock space skin effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hysteresis of magnetoresistance observed in superconductors is of great interest due to its potential connection with unconventional superconductivity. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements on Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ nanoflakes and uncover unusual hysteretic behaviour of magnetoresistance in the superconducting state. This hysteresis can be induced by applying either a large DC or AC current at temperatures ($T$) well below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). As $T$ approaches $T_{\rm c}$, similar weak hysteresis is also detected by applying a small current. Various scenarios are discussed, with particular focus on the effects of vortex pinning and the presence of time-reversal-symmtery-breaking superconducting domains. Our findings support the latter, hinting at chiral superconductivity in Kagome superconductors.</description>
