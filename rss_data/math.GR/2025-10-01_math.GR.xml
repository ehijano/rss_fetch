      <title>On minimal product-one sequences of maximal length over the non-abelian group of order $pq$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. A sequence over $G$ is a finite multiset of elements of $G$, and it is called product-one if its terms can be ordered so that their product is the identity of $G$. The large Davenport constant $\D(G)$ is the maximal length of a minimal product-one sequence, that is, a product-one sequence that cannot be partitioned into two nontrivial product-one subsequences. Let $p,q$ be odd prime numbers with $p \mid q-1$ and let $C_q \rtimes C_p$ denote the non-abelian group of order $pq$. It is known that $\D(C_q \rtimes C_p) = 2q$. In this paper, we describe all minimal product-one sequences of length $2q$ over $C_q \rtimes C_p$. As an application, we further investigate the $k$-th elasticity (and, consequently, the union of sets containing $k$) of the monoid of product-one sequences over these groups.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Proof of the Nonexistence of Tarski Monster Groups of Exponent 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that Tarski monster groups of exponent~3 do not exist. Traditional proofs rely on deep structural results, such as the restricted Burnside problem, properties of the free Burnside group, or Engel-type identities, and involve substantial technical computations. In this note we give a fully elementary proof: the argument reduces to a single simple identity, expressed as a key equation, whose verification requires only a brief calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the torsion-free rank of $H_i(M, \mathbb{Z}_p)$ has finite upper bound for $i \leq m$, where $M$ runs through the pro-$p$ subgroups of finite index in a pro-$p$ group $G$ that is (nilpotent of class $c$)-by-abelian such that $ G/N'$ is of type $FP_{2cm}$.</description>

      <title>Canonical Reduction Systems in Artin-Tits groups of spherical type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the canonical reduction system of an element in an Artin-Tits group of spherical type, which generalizes the similar notion for braids (and mapping classes) introduced by Birman, Lubotzky and McCarthy. We show its basic properties, which coincide with those satisfied in braid groups, and we provide an algorithm to compute it. We improve the algorithm in the case of braid groups, and discuss its complexity in this case. As a necessary result for obtaining the general algorithm, we prove that the centralizers of positive powers of an element form a periodic sequence and we show how to compute its period.</description>

      <title>On the finite irreducible subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of the finite subgroups of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ is a classical problem in the field of finite group theory, dating back to the late 19th century with authors like Klein, Jordan, Blichfeldt, etc. Throughout its long history, many results concerning the classification have been scattered in the mathematical literature. In this survey, we explore many of the most relevant results related to the classification, its structure, and the lists of groups. We mostly focus on the irreducible groups. In particular, classification statements are provided for primitive and imprimitive groups over prime dimension, and quasi-primitive groups of small composite dimension. We also provide tables with a detailed list of all (quasi)-primitive finite groups of dimension $n&lt;8$. Finally, we provide a computer program implementing many of the known results specific to the finite quasisimple irreducible projective groups, to improve and preserve the accessibility to these results and further their classification. See \S 4.2 and [37].
  We aim this survey to the non-specialist, so the provided classification results may easily accessible to mathematicians working outside of group theory.</description>

      <title>Structure groups and second homology groups of linear Alexander quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quandles are self-distributive algebraic structures known as sources of strong knots invariants, but also appearing in other contexts. From any quandle, one can construct two invariants: the structure group and the second quandle homology group. These groups are useful in applications, but hard to compute. In this paper, we focus on Alexander quandles over a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. By using explicit rewriting techniques, we show that the structure group of such a quandle injects into $\mathbb{Z}^m \ltimes \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $m$ is its number of orbits. This allows us to compute its second quandle homology group, and find that the torsion part depends only on $m$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>Matched pairs of Lie algebras and Rota-Baxter Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between matched pairs of Lie algebras and Rota-Baxter Lie algebras. First, we show that every Rota-Baxter Lie algebra $(\mathfrak{g},B)$ of weight $-1$ gives rise to a matched pair of Lie algebras $(\mathfrak{g}_+,\mathfrak{g}_-,\rhd,\bhd)$, and we prove that the bicrossed product Lie algebra decomposes as $\mathfrak{g}_+\bowtie\mathfrak{g}_-=\mathfrak{g}_1\oplus\mathfrak{g}_2$. Moreover, we establish a Rota-Baxter Lie algebra structure on $\mathfrak{g}_1$ which is isomorphic to $(\mathfrak{g},B)$ as a Rota-Baxter Lie algebra, and we endow $\mathfrak{g}_2$ with a Rota-Baxter Lie algebra structure. Then we study the connection between quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebras and Manin triples. We prove that every quadratic Rota-Baxter Lie algebra of weight $-1$ gives rise to a Manin triple, and we obtain a decomposition theorem for this Manin triple. Finally, we show that every Rota-Baxter group induces a matched pair of groups and investigate the internal structure of the induced matched pair of groups.</description>

      <title>Automorphic orbits in free groups: recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we describe recent progress on asymptotic properties of various automorphic orbits in free groups. In particular, we address the problem of counting potentially positive elements of a given length. We also discuss complexity (worst-case, average-case, and generic-case) of Whitehead's automorphism problem and relevant properties of automorphic orbits, including orbit-blocking words.</description>

      <title>The Tits alternative for visibility spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group acting properly discontinuously by isometries on a visibility CAT(0) space $X$ that satisfies the bounded packing property. We prove that $\Gamma$ satisfies the Tits alternative: it is either almost nilpotent or contains a free nonabelian subgroup of rank $2$. In the former case, it is equivalent to that the cardinality of the limit set of $\Gamma$ in the geometric boundary of $X$ is no greater than $2$. As an application of the Tits alternative, we show that any finitely generated torsion group acting properly discontinuously by isometries on such a space must be a finite group and have a global fixed point.</description>

      <title>A novel approach through spherical functions in the characterization of invariant polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a compact subgroup K of the orthogonal group acting on the Euclidean space Rn, Gerald Schwarz proved that every smooth K-invariant function on Rn can be expressed as a smooth function of a generating set of $K$-invariant polynomials on n variables. The goal of this work is to provide an alternative and more straightforward proof of this result, based on Gelfand theory, with a particular focus on spherical functions.</description>

Abstract: Fix $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We say that a finite group $G$ is $\varepsilon$-quasirandom if every nontrivial irreducible complex representation of $G$ has degree at least $|G|^\varepsilon$. In this paper, we give a structure theorem for large $\varepsilon$-quasirandom groups, and we completely classify the $\frac{1}{5}$-quasirandom groups.</description>

      <title>A "cubist" decomposition of the Handel-Mosher axis bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the axis bundle of a nongeometric fully irreducible outer automorphism admits a canonical "cubist" decomposition into branched cubes that fit together with special combinatorics. From this structure, we locate a canonical finite collection of periodic fold lines in each axis bundle. This can be considered as an analogue of results of Hamenst\"adt and Agol from the surface setting, which state that the set of trivalent train tracks carrying the unstable lamination of a pseudo-Anosov map can be given the structure of a CAT(0) cube complex, and that there is a canonical periodic fold line in this cube complex. This work also gives a "hands on" solution to the fully irreducible conjugacy problem in $\mathrm{Out}(F_r)$, and an answer to questions of Handel-Mosher and Bridson-Vogtmann regarding the geometry of the axis bundle.</description>

      <title>Groups admitting Wirtinger presentations and Gromov hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted Wirtinger presentations are generalizations of the classical Wirtinger presentations of knot and link groups. In this paper, we prove that if a finitely generated group admitting a twisted Wirtinger presentation is Gromov hyperbolic, then its second rational homology group vanishes. Moreover, if the group is torsion-free, then its second integral homology group also vanishes.</description>
