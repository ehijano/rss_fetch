      <title>Realtime Particulate Matter and Bacteria Analysis of Peritoneal Dialysis Fluid using Digital Inline Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a digital inline holography (DIH) system integrated with deep learning algorithms for real-time detection of particulate matter (PM) and bacterial contamination in peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. The system comprises a microfluidic sample delivery module and a DIH imaging module that captures holograms using a pulsed laser and a digital camera with a 40x objective. Our data processing pipeline enhances holograms, reconstructs images, and employs a YOLOv8n-based deep learning model for particle identification and classification, trained on labeled holograms of generic PD particles, Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). The system effectively detected and classified generic particles in sterile PD fluids, revealing diverse morphologies predominantly sized 1-5 um with an average concentration of 61 particles per microliter. In PD fluid samples spiked with high concentrations of E. coli and P. aeruginosa, our system achieved high sensitivity in detecting and classifying these bacteria at clinically relevant low false positive rates. Further validation against standard colony-forming unit (CFU) methods using PD fluid spiked with bacterial concentrations from approximately 100 to 10,000 bacteria per milliliter demonstrated a clear one-to-one correspondence between our measurements and CFU counts. Our DIH system provides a rapid, accurate alternative to traditional culture-based methods for assessing bacterial contamination in PD fluids. By enabling real-time sterility monitoring, it can significantly improve patient outcomes in PD treatment, facilitate point-of-care fluid production, reduce logistical challenges, and be extended to quality control in pharmaceutical production.</description>

      <title>A Robust Super-Resolution Classifier by Nonlinear Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial-mode projective measurements could achieve super-resolution in remote sensing and imaging, yet their performance is usually sensitive to the parameters of the target scenes. We propose and demonstrate a robust classifier of close-by light sources by using optimized mode projection via nonlinear optics. Contrary to linear-optics based methods using the first few Hermite-Gaussian modes for the projection, here the projection modes are optimally tailored by shaping the pump wave to drive the nonlinear optical process. This minimizes modulation losses and allows high flexibility in designing those modes for robust and efficient measurements. We test this classifier on discriminating one light source and two sources separated well within the Rayleigh limit without prior knowledge of the exact centroid or brightness. Our results show a classification fidelity of over 80% even when the centroid is misaligned by half the source separation, or when one source is four times stronger than the other.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'{e}rot open resonant cavities for measuring the dielectric parameters of mm-wave optical materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As millimeter-wave cosmology experiments refine their optical chains, precisely characterizing their optical materials under cryogenic conditions becomes increasingly important. For instance, as the aperture sizes and bandwidths of millimeter-wave receivers increase, the design of antireflection coatings becomes progressively more constrained by an accurate measure of material optical properties in order to achieve forecasted performance. Likewise, understanding dielectric and scattering losses is relevant to photon noise modeling in presently-deploying receivers such as BICEP Array and especially to future experiments such as CMB-S4. Additionally, the design of refractive elements such as lenses necessitates an accurate measure of the refractive index. High quality factor Fabry-P\'{e}rot open resonant cavities provide an elegant means for measuring these optical properties. Employing a hemispherical resonator that is compatible with a quick-turnaround 4 Kelvin cryostat, we can measure the dielectric and scattering losses of low-loss materials at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. We review the design, characterization, and metrological applications of quasioptical cavities commissioned for measuring the dielectric materials in the BICEP3 (95 GHz) and BICEP Array mid-frequency (150 GHz) optics. We also discuss the efforts to improve the finesse of said cavities, for better resolution of degenerate higher order modes, which can provide stronger constraints on cavity parameters and sample material thickness.</description>

      <title>High-space-bandwidth product characterization of metalenses with Fourier ptychographic microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large numerical aperture (NA) and large aperture metalenses have shown significant performance and abundant applications in biomedical and astronomical imaging fields. However, the high space-bandwidth product (SBP) requirements for measuring the phase of these metalenses, characterized by small phase periods and large apertures, have resulted in no effective techniques for sufficient characterization. In this paper, we propose a high SBP phase characterization technique using Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM), enabling a high spatial resolution and wide field of view simultaneously. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technique, we achieve a high SBP (4.91 megapixels) measurement and characterization for focusing and focusing vortex metalenses, quantitatively displaying the effect of fabrication error on their typical optical performance. Furthermore, we characterize the aberration type and amount of wavefront deviations caused by fabrication. We also analyze compensation methods for different aberrations based on the wavefront characterization results, providing a targeted alignment strategy for optimizing overall optical system performance. We believe that our high SBP characterization technique cannot only help to improve metalens design but also optimize its fabrication processing, which will pave the way for the diversified applications of metalenses.</description>

      <title>Modulational instability in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Bragg grating structures with four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of modulational instability (MI) in $\cal PT$-symmetric fiber Bragg gratings with a phenomenon of intermodulation known as four-wave mixing (FWM). Although the impact of FWM has already been analyzed in the conventional systems, the inclusion of gain and loss, which induces the notion of $\cal PT$- symmetry, gives rise to many noteworthy outcomes. These include the manifestation of an unusual double-loop structure in the dispersion curve, which was unprecedented in the context of conventional periodic structures. When it comes to the study of MI, which is usually obtained in the system by imposing a small amount of perturbations on the continuous wave by executing linear stability analysis, different regimes which range from conventional to broken $\cal PT$- symmetry tend to create quite a few types of MI spectra. Among them, we observe a unique MI pattern that mimics a tilted two-conical structure facing opposite to each other. In addition, we also address the impact of other non-trivial system parameters, such as input power, gain and loss and self-phase modulation in two important broad domains, including normal and anomalous dispersion regimes under the three types of $\cal PT$- symmetric conditions in detail.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expressions for Effective Indices of Modes of Optical Fibers Near and Beyond Cutoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an analytical expression for the effective indices of modes of circular step-index fibers valid near their cutoff wavelengths. The approximation, being a first-order Taylor series of a smooth function, is also valid for the real part of the effective index beyond cutoff where the modes become lossy. The approximation is used to derive certain previously unknown mode properties. For example, it is shown that for non-dispersive materials the EH-mode group index at cutoff, surprisingly, does not depend on wavelength, core radius, or even radial mode order.</description>

      <title>Scalable Miniature On-chip Fourier Transform Spectrometer For Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized spectrometers for Raman spectroscopy have the potential to open up a new chapter in sensing. Raman spectroscopy is essential for material characterization and biomedical diagnostics, however, its weak signal and the need for sub-nanometer resolution pose challenges. Conventional spectrometers, with footprints proportional to optical throughput and resolution, are difficult to integrate into compact devices such as wearables. Waveguide-based Fourier Transform Spectrometers (FTS) enable compact spectrometers, and multi-aperture designs can achieve high throughput for applications such as Raman spectroscopy, however, experimental research in this domain remains limited. In this work, we present a multi-aperture SiN waveguide-based FTS overcoming these limitations and enabling Raman spectroscopy of isopropyl alcohol, glucose, Paracetamol, and Ibuprofen with enhanced throughput. Our spectrometer chip, fabricated on a 200 mm SiN wafer, with 160 edge-coupled waveguide apertures connected to an array of ultra-compact interferometers and a small footprint of just 1.6 mm x 4.8 mm, achieves a spectral range of 40 nm and a resolution of 0.5 nm. Experimental results demonstrate that least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression significantly enhances Raman spectrum reconstruction. Our work on waveguide-based spectrometry paves the way for integrating accurate and compact Raman sensors into consumer electronics and space exploration instruments.</description>

      <title>Ultra-broadband UV/VIS spectroscopy enabled by resonant dispersive wave emission of a frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel ultra-broadband ultraviolet and visible frequency comb light source covering more than 240 THz by resonant dispersive wave emission in a gas-filled hollow-core fiber waveguide. The light source allows tuning from ~340 nm to 465 nm (645 THz to ~885 THz) with conversion efficiencies of 1.5 %. Ultra-broadband absorption spectroscopy is demonstrated by studying nitrogen dioxide, a molecular species of major atmospheric relevance strongly absorbing across the ultraviolet and visible spectral region. We show that the coherence of the 80 MHz ytterbium fiber-based frequency comb seeding the frequency up-conversion process is conserved, paving the way toward further ultra-broadband (dual) comb spectroscopy across the ultraviolet/visible range.</description>

      <title>Laser Pulse Diagnostics of Ultrafast &lt;8 fs Pulses Through Two-Photon Absorption Fluorescence In Liquid Media -- The Role of GVD and Third-Order Dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the propagation of an ultrafast laser pulse through a liquid medium. A femtosecond laser oscillator with a pulse duration of less than 8 fs is used. By conducting experiments with coumarin and fluorescein dyes in water, methanol, and chloroform, we analyze two-photon absorption (TPA) fluorescence, a method pioneered by Schr\"oder [Opt. Express 14, 10125 (2006)]. A numerical algorithm we developed to model the fluorescence signal determines the group velocity dispersion (GVD), the third-order dispersion (TOD), and the group delay dispersion (GDD). Autocorrelation measurements combined with a detailed analysis confirm the validity of our method and the accuracy of the retrieved temporal profile of the pulse. This cost-effective approach is robust and useful for laser pulse characterization, outperforming traditional methods in terms of alignment sensitivity. Our method allows us to study the time evolution of the pulses as they propagate through the liquid, determines higher-order phase terms as acquired by the pulse while reflecting off the chirped mirrors and propagating through the liquid, and even works for non-Gaussian spectral intensities of the laser.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Ultra-Low-Loss, Dispersion-Engineered Silicon Nitride Photonic Integrated Circuits via Silicon Hardmask Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have emerged as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, such as nonlinear optics, narrow-linewidth lasers, and quantum photonics. While thin-film Si$_3$N$_4$ processes have been extensively developed, many nonlinear and quantum optics applications require the use of thick Si$_3$N$_4$ films with engineered dispersion, high mode confinement, and low optical loss. However, high tensile stress in thick Si$_3$N$_4$ films often leads to cracking, making the fabrication challenging to meet these requirements. In this work, we present a robust and reliable fabrication method for ultra-low-loss, dispersion-engineered Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs using amorphous silicon (a-Si) hardmask etching. This approach enables smooth etching of thick Si$_3$N$_4$ waveguides while ensuring long-term storage of crack-free Si$_3$N$_4$ wafers. We achieve intrinsic quality factors ($Q_i$) as high as $25.6 \times 10^6$, corresponding to a propagation loss of 1.6 dB/m. The introduction of a-Si hardmask etching and novel crack-isolation trenches offers notable advantages, including high etching selectivity, long-term wafer storage, high yield, and full compatibility with existing well-developed silicon-based semiconductor processes. We demonstrate frequency comb generation in the fabricated microring resonators, showcasing the platform's potential for applications in optical communication, nonlinear optics, metrology, and spectroscopy. This stable and efficient fabrication method offers high performance with significantly reduced fabrication complexity, representing a remarkable advancement toward mass production of Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs for a wide spectrum of applications.</description>

      <title>Modal complexity as a metric for Anderson localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thorough study of the complexity of optical localized modes in two-dimensional disordered photonic crystals. Direct experimental measurements of complexity were made using an interferometric setup that allowed for extraction of phases and, hence, complex-valued wavefunctions. The comparison of experimental and theoretical results allows us to propose a metric for Anderson localization based on the average value and statistical distribution of complexity. Being an alternative to other known criteria of localization, the proposed metric exploits the openness of the disordered medium and provides a quantitative characterization of the degree of localization allowing for determining the localization length.</description>

      <title>Manipulating terahertz phonon-polariton in the ultrastrong coupling regime with bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling between photons and phonons in polar materials gives rise to phonon-polaritons that encapsulate a wealth of physical information, offering crucial tools for the ultrafast terahertz sources and the topological engineering of terahertz light. However, it is still quite challenging to form and manipulate the terahertz phonon-polaritons under the ultrastrong coupling regime till now. In this work, we demonstrate the ultrastrong coupling between the phonon (at 0.95 THz) in a MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film and the metallic bound states in the continuum (BICs) in Au metasurfaces. The Rabi splitting can be continuously tuned from 28% to 48.4% of the phonon frequency by adjusting the parameters (size, shape and period) of Au metasurfaces, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime. By introducing wavelet transform, the mode evolution information of the terahertz phonon-polariton is successfully extracted. It indicates that the phonon radiation intensity of the MaPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film is enhanced as the coupling strength is increased. This work not only establishes a new platform for terahertz devices but also opens new avenues for exploring the intricate dynamics of terahertz phonon-polaritons.</description>

      <title>Global Alignment Reference Strategy for Laser Interference Lithography Pattern Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-area gratings play a crucial role in various engineering fields. However, traditional interference lithography is limited by the size of optical component apertures, making large-area fabrication a challenging task. Here, a method for fabricating laser interference lithography pattern arrays with a global alignment reference strategy is proposed. This approach enables alignment of each area of the laser interference lithography pattern arrays, including phase, period, and tilt angle. Two reference gratings are utilized: one is detached from the substrate, while the other remains fixed to it. To achieve global alignment, the exposure area is adjusted by alternating between moving the beam and the substrate. In our experiment, a 3 $\times$ 3 regions grating array was fabricated, and the $-1$st-order diffraction wavefront measured by the Fizeau interferometer exhibited good continuity. This technique enables effective and efficient alignment with high accuracy across any regions in an interference lithography pattern array on large substrates.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study on the Potential Enhancement of Organic Terahertz Sources through Tilted Pulse Front Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic crystals offer promising potential for THz generation, but face limitations in wavelength tunability and damage threshold. By applying tilted pulse front pumping to organic crystals an additional degree of freedom is introduced into the pumping conditions enabling a wider range of pumping wavelengths without compromising phase matching. Additionally, the lifespan of organic materials can be extended by using longer pumping wavelength and eliminate lower-order multi-photon absorption, allowing for higher pumping intensity without significant free carrier absorption, thus increasing the damage threshold. Simulations predict significant improvement for four out of six investigated crystals when tilted pulse front pumping is applied. By using volume phase holographic grating one can achieve pulse front tilt in organic crystals in collinear geometry with high diffraction efficiency. Design parameters are also presented.</description>

      <title>Theoretical performance limitations and filter selection based on Fisher information of a computational photonic crystal spectrometer for trace-gas retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As global climate change severely impacts our world, there is an increasing demand to monitor trace gases with a high spatial resolution and accuracy. At the same time, these instruments need to be compact in order have constellations for short revisit times. Here we present a new spectrometer instrument concept for trace gas detection, where photonic crystals filters replace traditional diffraction based optical elements. In this concept, 2D photonic crystal slabs with unique transmission profiles are bonded on a detector inside a regular telescope. As the instrument flies over the earth, different integrated intensities for each filter are measured for a single ground resolution element with a regular telescope. From this detector data, trace gas concentrations are retrieved. As an initial test case we focused on methane and carbon dioxide retrieval and estimated the performance of such an instrument. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound for trace-gas retrieval for such a spectrometer using Fisher information and compare this with the achieved performance. We furthermore set up a framework how to select photonic crystal filters based on maximizing the Fisher information carried by the filters and how to use the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound to find good filter sets. The retrieval performance of such an instrument is found to be between 0.4% to 0.9% for methane and 0.2% to 0.5% for carbon dioxide detection for a 300x300 m2 ground resolution element and realistic instrument parameters.</description>

      <title>Influence of noise-induced modulations on the timing stability of passively mode-locked semiconductor laser subject to optical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that passively mode-locked lasers subject to feedback from a single external cavity can exhibit large timing fluctuations on short time scales despite having a relatively small long-term timing jitter, meaning that the commonly used von Linde and K\'{e}f\'{e}lian techniques of experimentally estimating the timing jitter can lead to large errors in the estimation of the arrival time of pulses. We also show that adding a second feedback cavity of the appropriate length can significantly suppress noise-induced modulations that are present in the single feedback system. This reduces the short time scale fluctuations of the interspike interval time and at the same time improves the variance of the fluctuation of the pulse arrival times on long time scales.</description>

      <title>Development of a photonic crystal spectrometer for greenhouse gas measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need of atmospheric information with a higher spatial and temporal resolution drives the development of small satellites and satellite constellations to complement satellite flagship missions. Since optical systems are a main contributor to the satellite size, these are the prime candidate for their miniaturization. We present here a novel optical system where the complete spectrometer part of the optical system is compressed in one flat optical element. The element consists of an array of photonic crystals which is directly placed on a detector. The photonic crystals act as optical filters with a tunable spectral transmission response. From the integrated optical signals per filter and the atmosphere model, greenhouse gas concentrations are obtained using computational inversion. We present in this article the instrument concept, the manufacturing and measurement of the photonic crystals, methods for the filter array optimization, and discuss the predicted retrieval performance for the detection of methane and carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Single-Atomic-Ensemble Dual-Wavelength Optical Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dual wavelength optical frequency standard based on the dual optical transition modulation transfer spectroscopy (DOTMTS) between different quantum transitions of the rubidium D1 (795 nm) and D2 (780 nm) lines. In a single rubidium atomic ensemble, modulation frequency sidebands from the 780 nm pump beam are simultaneously transferred to both the 780 nm and 795 nm probe lasers. The DOTMTS enables the simultaneous stabilization of 780 nm and 795 nm lasers on a single vapor cell. Both lasers exhibit a frequency instability in the low 10 ^(-14) range at 1 s of averaging, as estimated from the residual error signal. A theoretical model is developed based on the V type atomic level structure to illustrate the dual-wavelength spectroscopy. This approach can be extended to develop a multiwavelength optical frequency standard within a single atomic ensemble, broadening its applicability in fields such as precision metrology, wavelength standards, optical networks, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of Photonic Lanterns Using Coupled-Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02182v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design space for the fabrication of photonic lanterns is vast, which allows for a great diversity of designs but also complicates finding the right parameters for a given component. Coupled-mode theory is a great tool to sort through the parameter space and find the right designs for a multiplicity of photonic lantern types, including conventional, mode-selective, and anything in-between. It correctly models the behavior of the fabricated component, but it also simplifies the task of finding the right fabrication sequence by computing the all-important adiabatic criteria, which dictate which transverse modes will couple, and at which step of the recipe. Here, using coupled-mode theory, we predict and test experimentally the behavior of four types of 3X1 photonic lanterns ranging from conventional to mode-specific and hybrid configurations, and explain mode-coupling, operation bandwidth, and excess loss mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Braided interferometer mesh for robust photonic matrix-vector multiplications with non-ideal components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) are essential for a wide range of applications, particularly in modern machine learning and quantum computing. In photonics, there is growing interest in developing architectures capable of performing linear operations with high speed, low latency, and minimal loss. Traditional interferometric photonic architectures, such as the Clements design, have been extensively used for MVM operations. However, as these architectures scale, improving stability and robustness becomes critical. In this paper, we introduce a novel photonic braid interferometer architecture that outperforms both the Clements and Fldzhyan designs in these aspects. Using numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of these architectures under ideal conditions and systematically introduce non-idealities such as insertion losses, beam splitter imbalances, and crosstalk. The results demonstrate that the braid architecture offers superior robustness due to its symmetrical design and reduced layer count. Further analysis shows that the braid architecture is particularly advantageous in large-scale implementations, delivering better performance as the size of the interferometer increases. We also assess the footprint and total insertion losses of each architecture. Although waveguide crossings in the braid architecture slightly increase the footprint and insertion loss, recent advances in crossing technology significantly minimize these effects. Our study suggests that the braid architecture is a robust solution for photonic neuromorphic computing, maintaining high fidelity in realistic conditions where imperfections are inevitable.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-Induced Nonlinear Response in ZnTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring terahertz waveforms in terahertz spectroscopy often relies on electro optic sampling employing a ZnTe crystal. Although the nonlinearities in such zincblende semiconductors induced by intense terahertz pulses have been studied at optical frequencies, the manifestation of nonlinearity in the terahertz regime has not been reported. In this work, we investigate the nonlinear response of ZnTe in the terahertz frequency region utilizing time-resolved terahertz-pump terahertz-probe spectroscopy. We find that the interaction of two co-propagating terahertz pulses in ZnTe leads to a nonlinear polarization change which modifies the electro-optic response of the medium. We present a model for this polarization that showcases the second-order nonlinear behavior. We also determine the magnitude of the third-order susceptibility in ZnTe at terahertz frequencies, $\chi^{\mathrm{(3)}}(\omega_\text{THz})$. These results clarify the interactions in ZnTe at terahertz frequencies, with implications for measurements of intense terahertz fields using electro-optic sampling.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Graphene-based Sub-Terahertz Receivers enabling Wireless Communications for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the telecommunications field has experienced an unparalleled proliferation of wireless data traffic. Innovative solutions are imperative to circumvent the inherent limitations of the current technology, in particular in terms of capacity. Carrier frequencies in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) range (~0.2-0.3 THz) can deliver increased capacity and low attenuation for short-range wireless applications. Here, we demonstrate a direct, passive and compact sub-THz receiver based on graphene, which outperforms state-of-the-art sub-THz receivers. These graphene-based receivers offer a cost-effective, CMOS-compatible, small-footprint solution that can fulfill the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) requirements of 6G technologies. We exploit a sub-THz cavity, comprising an antenna and a back mirror, placed in the vicinity of the graphene channel to overcome the low inherent absorption in graphene and the mismatch between the areas of the photoactive region and the incident radiation, which becomes extreme in the sub-THz range. The graphene receivers achieve a multigigabit per second data rate with a maximum distance of ~3 m from the transmitter, a setup-limited 3 dB bandwidth of 40 GHz, and a high responsivity of 0.16 A/W, enabling applications such as chip-to-chip communication and close proximity device-to-device communication.</description>

      <title>Few photons probe third-order nonlinear properties of nanomaterials in a plasmonic nanocavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantification of nonlinear optical properties is required for nano-optical devices, but they are challenging to measure on a nanomaterial. Here, we harness enhanced optical fields inside a plasmonic nanocavity to mediate efficient nonlinear interactions with the nanomaterials. We performed reflection Z-scan technique at intensity levels of kWcm^2, reaching down to two photons per pulse, in contrast to GWcm^2 in conventional methods. The few photons are sufficient to extract the nonlinear refractive index and nonlinear absorption coefficient of different nanomaterials, including perovskite and Au nano-objects and a molecular monolayer. This work is of great interest for investigating nonlinear optical interactions on the nanoscale and characterizing nanomaterials, including fragile biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of single sub-15 nm objects using elastic scattering strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic nano-objects play crucial roles in diverse fields, including biomedical imaging, nanomedicine, spectroscopy, and photocatalysis. Nano-objects with sizes that are less than 15 nm exhibit extremely low light scattering cross-sections, posing a significant challenge for optical detection. A possible approach to enhance the optical detection is to exploit nonlinearity of strong coupling regime, especially for elastic light scattering, which is universal to all objects. However, there is still no observation of the strong coupling of elastic light scattering from nanoobjects. Here, we demonstrate the strong coupling of elastic light scattering in self-assembled plasmonic nanocavities formed between a gold (Au) nanoprobe and an Au film. We employ this technique to detect individual objects with diameters down to 1.8 nm inside the nanocavity. The resonant mode of the nano-object on the Au film strongly couples with the nanocavity mode, revealing anti-crossing scattering modes under dark-field spectroscopy. The experimental result agrees well with numerical calculations, which we use to extend this technique to other metals, including silver, copper, and aluminum. Furthermore, our results show that the scattering cross-section ratio of the nano-object scales with the electric f ield to the fourth power, similar to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This work establishes a new possibility of elastic strong coupling and demonstrates its applicability for observing small, non-fluorescent, Raman inactive sub-15 nm objects, complementary to existing microscopes.</description>

      <title>Re-thinking Richardson-Lucy without Iteration Cutoffs: Physically Motivated Bayesian Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Richardson-Lucy deconvolution is widely used to restore images from degradation caused by the broadening effects of a point spread function and corruption by photon shot noise, in order to recover an underlying object. In practice, this is achieved by iteratively maximizing a Poisson emission likelihood. However, the RL algorithm is known to prefer sparse solutions and overfit noise, leading to high-frequency artifacts. The structure of these artifacts is sensitive to the number of RL iterations, and this parameter is typically hand-tuned to achieve reasonable perceptual quality of the inferred object. Overfitting can be mitigated by introducing tunable regularizers or other ad hoc iteration cutoffs in the optimization as otherwise incorporating fully realistic models can introduce computational bottlenecks. To resolve these problems, we present Bayesian deconvolution, a rigorous deconvolution framework that combines a physically accurate image formation model avoiding the challenges inherent to the RL approach. Our approach achieves deconvolution while satisfying the following desiderata:
  I deconvolution is performed in the spatial domain (as opposed to the frequency domain) where all known noise sources are accurately modeled and integrated in the spirit of providing full probability distributions over the density of the putative object recovered;
  II the probability distribution is estimated without making assumptions on the sparsity or continuity of the underlying object;
  III unsupervised inference is performed and converges to a stable solution with no user-dependent parameter tuning or iteration cutoff;
  IV deconvolution produces strictly positive solutions; and
  V implementation is amenable to fast, parallelizable computation.</description>

      <title>Novel Topology and Manipulation of Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of wave scattering in complex non-Hermitian settings is an exciting subject -- often challenging the creativity of researchers and stimulating the imagination of the public. Successful outcomes include invisibility cloaks, wavefront shaping protocols, active metasurface development, and more. At their core, these achievements rely on our ability to engineer the resonant spectrum of the underlying physical structures which is conventionally accomplished by carefully imposing geometrical and/or dynamical symmetries. In contrast, by taking active control over the boundary conditions in complex scattering environments which lack artificially-imposed geometric symmetries, we demonstrate via microwave experiments the ability to manipulate the spectrum of the scattering operator. This active control empowers the creation, destruction and repositioning of exceptional point degeneracies (EPD's) in a two-dimensional (2D) parameter space. The presence of EPD's signifies a coalescence of the scattering eigenmodes, which dramatically affects transport. The scattering EPD's are partitioned in domains characterized by a binary charge, as well as an integer winding number, are topologically stable in the two-dimensional parameter space, and obey winding number-conservation laws upon interactions with each other, even in cases where Lorentz reciprocity is violated; in this case the topological domains are destroyed. Ramifications of this understanding is the proposition for a unique input-magnitude/phase-insensitive 50:50 in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) power splitter. Our study establishes an important step towards complete control of scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: Dry synthesis is a highly versatile method for the fabrication of nanoporous metal films, since it enables easy and reproducible deposition of single or multi-layer(s) of nanostructured materials that can find intriguing applications in plasmonics, photochemistry and photocatalysis, to name a few. Here, we extend the use of this methodology to the preparation of copper nanoislands that represent an affordable and versatile example of disordered plasmonic substrate. We perform detailed characterizations of the system using several techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry, cathodoluminescence, electron energy loss spectroscopy, ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation with the aim to investigate the optical properties of these systems in an unprecedented systematic way. Our study represents the starting point for future applications of this new disordered plasmonic system ranging from sensing to photochemistry and photocatalysis.</description>

Abstract: Laser-induced strong-field ionization tomography (LISFIT) is an emerging space-time tomographic modality with the potential to revolutionize imaging capabilities. To fully harness its power, a robust theoretical framework is essential. This work delves into the fundamental physics of strong-field ionization and its implications for tomographic imaging.
  Our analysis reveals an operational regime with significant resolution enhancement and unique intensity-resolution coupling, alongside localization phenomena rooted in the physics of strong-field interactions. We further identify a trade-off between resolution, localization extent, and signal-to-noise ratio, providing critical insights for optimizing experimental parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive framework of modeling covariance in angular streaking experiments is presented. Within the impulsive streaking regime, the displacement of electron momentum distribution (MD) provides a tight connection between the dressing-free MD and the dressed MD. Such connection establishes universal structures in the composition of streaking covariance that are common across different MDs, regardless of their exact shape. Building on this robust framework, we have developed methods for retrieving temporal information from angular streaking measurements. By providing a detailed understanding of the covariance structure in angular streaking experiments, our work enables more accurate and robust temporal measurements in a wide range of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a Chern insulator: topological signature and long-range repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir-Polder interaction between a two-level atomic system and a Chern insulator for both the resonant and nonresonant channels. For a right circularly polarized excited atomic state near a Chern insulator with a negative Chern number $C$, the resonant Casimir-Polder force can be monotonically repulsive over a large range of separations. In the presence of the same Chern insulator, a right circularly polarized metastable atomic state is expected to experience a repulsive nonresonant Casimir-Polder force over a certain range of atom-surface separations in the far-field region. At still greater separations, the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force is expected to become attractive and exhibit a topological signature, being proportional to $(C\alpha)^2/(1+(C\alpha)^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer for Minimizing XY Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Complex Vector Gain-Based Annealer (CoVeGA), an analog computing platform designed to overcome energy barriers in XY Hamiltonians through a higher-dimensional representation. Traditional gain-based solvers utilizing optical or photonic hardware typically represent each XY spin with a single complex field. These solvers often struggle with large energy barriers in complex landscapes, leading to relaxation into excited states. CoVeGA addresses these limitations by employing two complex fields to represent each XY spin and dynamically evolving the energy landscape through time-dependent annealing. Operating in a higher-dimensional space, CoVeGA bridges energy barriers in this expanded space during the continuous phase evolution, thus avoiding entrapment in local minima. We introduce several graph structures that pose challenges for XY minimization and use them to benchmark CoVeGA against single-dimension XY solvers, highlighting the benefits of higher-dimensional operation.</description>

      <title>Rydberg series of intralayer K-excitons in WSe$_2$ multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides of group VI are well-known for their prominent excitonic effects and the transition from an indirect to a direct band gap when reduced to monolayers. While considerable efforts have elucidated the Rydberg series of excitons in monolayers, understanding their properties in multilayers remains incomplete. In these structures, despite an indirect band gap, momentum-direct excitons largely shape the optical response. In this work, we combine magneto-reflectance experiments with theoretical modeling based on the $\mathbf {k\cdot p}$ approach to investigate the origin of excitonic resonances in WSe$_2$ bi-, tri-, and quadlayers. For all investigated thicknesses, we observe a series of excitonic resonances in the reflectance spectra, initiated by a ground state with an amplitude comparable to the ground state of the 1$s$ exciton in the monolayer. Higher energy states exhibit a decrease in intensity with increasing energy, as expected for the excited states of the Rydberg series, although a significant increase in the diamagnetic shift is missing in tri- and quadlayers. By comparing the experimental observations with theoretical predictions, we discover that the excitonic resonances observed in trilayers originate from two Rydberg series, while quadlayers exhibit four such series, and bilayers host a single Rydberg series similar to that found in monolayers.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy of correlated lattice systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) has been established in quantum chemistry as a powerful tool for studying the nonlinear response and nonequilibrium dynamics of molecular systems. More recently, the technique has also been applied to correlated electron materials, where the interplay of localized and itinerant states makes the interpretation of the spectra more challenging. Here we use the Keldysh contour representation of effective models and nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory to systematically study the MDCS signals of prototypical correlated lattice systems. By analyzing the current induced by sequences of ultrashort laser pulses we demonstrate the usefulness of MDCS as a diagnostic tool for excitation pathways and coherent processes in correlated solids. We also show that this technique allows to extract detailed information on the nature and evolution of photo-excited nonequilibrium states.</description>

      <title>200mm Optical synthetic aperture imaging over 120 meters distance via Macroscopic Fourier ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier ptychography (FP) imaging, drawing on the idea of synthetic aperture, has been demonstrated as a potential approach for remote sub-diffraction-limited imaging. Nevertheless, the farthest imaging distance is still limited around 10 m even though there has been a significant improvement in macroscopic FP. The most severely issue in increasing the imaging distance is field of view (FoV) limitation caused by far-field condition for diffraction. Here, we propose to modify the Fourier far-field condition for rough reflective objects, aiming to overcome the small FoV limitation by using a divergent beam to illuminate objects. A joint optimization of pupil function and target image is utilized to attain the aberration-free image while estimating the pupil function simultaneously. Benefiting from the optimized reconstruction algorithm which effectively expands the camera's effective aperture, we experimentally implement several FP systems suited for imaging distance of 12 m, 65 m and 120m with the maximum synthetic aperture of 200 mm. The maximum synthetic aperture is thus improved by more than one order of magnitude of the state-of-the-art works from the furthest distance, with an over fourfold improvement in the resolution compare to single aperture. Our findings demonstrate significant potential for advancing the field of macroscopic FP, propelling it into a new stage of development.</description>

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Coupling of Light in Twin-Resonators with Kerr Nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear effects in microresonators are efficient building blocks for all-optical computing and telecom systems. With the latest advances in microfabrication, coupled microresonators are used in a rapidly growing number of applications. In this work, we investigate the coupling between twin-resonators in the presence of Kerr-nonlinearity. We use an experimental setup with controllable coupling between two high-Q resonators and discuss the effects caused by the simultaneous presence of linear and non-linear coupling between the optical fields. Linear-coupling-induced mode splitting is observed at low input powers, with the controllable coupling leading to a tunable mode splitting. At high input powers, the hybridized resonances show spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) effects, in which the optical power is unevenly distributed between the resonators. Our experimental results are supported by a detailed theoretical model of nonlinear twin-resonators. With the recent interest in coupled resonator systems for neuromorphic computing, quantum systems, and optical frequency comb generation, our work provides important insights into the behavior of these systems at high circulating powers.</description>

      <title>An ultra-broadband photonic-chip-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical amplification, crucial for modern communication and data center interconnects, primarily relies on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers (EDFAs) to enhance signals without distortion. While EDFAs were historically decisive for the introduction of dense wavelength-division multiplexing, they only cover a portion of the low-loss spectrum of optical fibers. Pioneering work on optical traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) utilizing intrinsic third-order optical nonlinearity has led to demonstrations of increased channel capacity and performance. TWPAs are unidirectional, offer high gain, and can reach the 3-dB quantum limit for phase-preserving amplifiers. Despite the use of highly nonlinear fibers or bulk waveguides, their power requirements and technical complexity have impeded adoption. In contrast, TWPAs based on photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer the advantages of substantially increased mode confinement and optical nonlinearity but have been limited in bandwidth because of the trade-off with maintaining low propagation loss. We overcome this challenge by using low-loss gallium phosphide-on-silicon dioxide PICs and attain up to 35~dB of parametric gain with waveguides only a few centimeters long in a compact footprint of 0.25 square millimeters. Fiber-to-fiber net gain exceeding 10 dB across a bandwidth of approximately 140 nm is achieved, surpassing the gain window of a standard C-band EDFA. We furthermore demonstrate the capability to handle weak signals; input powers can range over six orders of magnitude while maintaining a low noise figure. We exploit these performance characteristics to amplify both optical frequency combs and coherent communication signals. This marks the first ultra-broadband, high-gain, continuous-wave amplification in a PIC, opening up new capabilities for next-generation optical communication, metrology, and sensing.</description>

      <title>On the Exact Maxwell evolution equation of resonator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent publication [Opt. Express 32, 20904 (2024)], the accuracy of the main evolution equation that governs resonator dynamics in the coupled-mode theory (CMT) was questioned. The study concluded that the driving force is proportional to the temporal derivative of the excitation field rather than the excitation field itself. This conclusion was reached with a derivation of an "exact" Maxwell evolution (EME) equation obtained directly from Maxwell's equations, which was further supported by extensive numerical tests. Hereafter, we argue that the original derivation lacks mathematical rigor. We present a direct and rigorous derivation that establishes a solid mathematical foundation for the EME equation. This new approach clarifies the origin of the temporal derivative in the excitation term of CMT and elucidates the approximations present in the classical CMT evolution equation through a straightforward argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of light with superluminally moving matter entails unconventional phenomena, from Fresnel drag to Hawking radiation and to light amplification. While relativity makes these effects inaccessible using objects in motion, synthetic motion - enabled via space-time modulated internal degrees of freedom - is free from these constraints. Here we observe synthetic velocity of a reflectivity modulation travelling on an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) interface, generated by ultrafast laser illumination at multiple positions and times. The interaction of the moving reflectivity modulation with a probe light beam acts as a non-separable spatio-temporal transformation that diffracts the light, changing its frequency and momentum content. The recorded frequency-momentum diffraction pattern is defined by the velocity of the diffracted probe wave relative to the modulation. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature valley-selective emission in Si-MoSe2 heterostructures enabled by high-quality-factor chiroptical cavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) possess valley pseudospin, allowing photon spin to be coupled to electron spin and enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission, even with linearly polarized excitation. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, resulting in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiral electromagnetic modes with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths, spectrally tuned to the exciton energy of MoSe2 monolayers. Using spatially- and spectrally-resolved mapping from temperatures of 100 K to 294 K, we demonstrate degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Reciprocal space mapping of the exciton emission reveals the chiral q-BIC localizes valley-selective emission in the vicinity of the photonic gamma-point. Photon-spin and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states provided by the metasurface, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of approximately 13, with lifetimes as short as 189 ps. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate on-chip control and analysis of spatially multimode nonlinear interactions in silicon nitride waveguide circuits. Using widely different dispersion of transverse supermodes in a strongly-coupled dual-core waveguide section, and using integrated pairs of input and output single-mode waveguides, we enable controlled excitation of nonlinear processes in multiple supermodes, while a basic physical mode decomposition aids the identification of parallel and cascaded processes. Pumping with ultrashort pulses at 1.5-$\mu$m wavelength (around 195-THz light frequency), we observe simultaneous dual-supermode, near-infrared supercontinuum generation having different spectral widths, in parallel with third-harmonic generation at around 515 nm (582 THz). Cascaded four-wave mixing with supercontinuum components upconverts the third-harmonic radiation toward a set of four shorter blue wavelengths emitted in the range between 485 and 450 nm (617 to 661 THz). The approach taken here, i.e., using chip-integrated spatial multiplexing and demultiplexing for excitation and analysis of broadband transverse nonlinear conversion, can be an advanced tool for better understanding and control in multimode nonlinear optics, such as for extending frequency conversion to wider spectral ranges via extra phase matching paths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. This work focuses the discussion on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the Floquet direction considered. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>

Abstract: The study is focused on the dispersion properties of a wire medium formed by a rectangular lattice of parallel wires at the frequencies close to its plasma frequency. While the effective medium theory predicts isotropic behaviour of transverse magnetic (TM) waves in the structure, numerical simulations reveal noticeable anisotropic properties. This anisotropy is dependent on the lattice rectangularity and reaches over 6% and over 75% along and across the wires respectively for thick wires with the radii about 20 times smaller than the smallest period. This conclusion is confirmed by line-of-current approximation theory. The revealed anisotropy effect is observed when the wavelength at the plasma frequency is comparable to the period of the structure. The effect vanishes in the case of extremely thin wires. A dispersion relation for TM waves in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point was obtained in a closed form. This provides an analytical description of the anisotropy effect.</description>

      <title>Deterministic photonic entanglement arising from non-Abelian quantum holonomy</title>

Abstract: Realizing deterministic, high-fidelity entangling interactions--of the kind that can be utilized for efficient quantum information processing--between photons remains an elusive goal. Here, we address this long-standing issue by devising a protocol for creating and manipulating highly-entangled superpositions of well-controlled states of light by using an on-chip photonic system that has recently been shown to implement three-dimensional, non-Abelian quantum holonomy. Our calculations indicate that a subset of such entangled superpositions are maximally-entangled, "volume-law" states, and that the underlying entanglement can be distilled and purified for applications in quantum science. Crucially, we generalize this approach to demonstrate the potentiality of deterministically entangling two arbitrarily high, $N$-dimensional quantum systems, by formally establishing a deep connection between the matrix representations of the unitary quantum holonomy--within energy-degenerate subspaces in which the total excitation number is conserved--and the $\left(2j+1\right)$-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation operator, where $j = \left(N-1\right)/2$ and $N \geq 2$. Specifically, we envisage that this entangling mechanism could be utilized for realizing universal, entangling quantum gates with linear photonic elements alone.</description>

      <title>A simple test of local realistic hidden-variable theories without inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most tests of the validity of local realistic hidden-variable theories with respect to quantum mechanics, are based on inequalities such as Bell's inequality and Clauser Horne, Shimony, and Holt's inequality. In this work we present a simple alternative test which does not involve inequalities, but a direct comparison between correlation functions given by quantum mechanics and local realistic hidden-variable theories. Our test is based on a physically motivated use of Fourier series for periodic functions, and confirms that local realistic hidden-variable theories are incompatible with quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>From broadband biphotons to frequency combs via spectral compression with time-varying cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biphoton frequency combs are promising resources for quantum networking due in large part to their compatibility with the telecommunication infrastructure. In this work, we propose a method to periodically compress broadband frequency-entangled photons into biphoton frequency combs by utilizing time-varying linear cavities. Our approach hinges on rapid modulation of the input cavity coupling, yielding high spectral purity in each output comb line similar to that achieved with narrowband filters, but without the associated loss in flux. We examine the dependence of spectral purity and compression on coupling strength, cavity loss, and switching speed, finding realistic regimes supporting purities in excess of 0.999 and peak enhancement factors of 100 and beyond.</description>
