      <title>SEE: Semantically Aligned EEG-to-Text Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoding neurophysiological signals into language is of great research interest within brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Electroencephalography (EEG), known for its non-invasiveness, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness, has been a popular method in this field. However, current EEG-to-Text decoding approaches face challenges due to the huge domain gap between EEG recordings and raw texts, inherent data bias, and small closed vocabularies. In this paper, we propose SEE: Semantically Aligned EEG-to-Text Translation, a novel method aimed at improving EEG-to-Text decoding by seamlessly integrating two modules into a pre-trained BART language model. These two modules include (1) a Cross-Modal Codebook that learns cross-modal representations to enhance feature consolidation and mitigate domain gap, and (2) a Semantic Matching Module that fully utilizes pre-trained text representations to align multi-modal features extracted from EEG-Text pairs while considering noise caused by false negatives, i.e., data from different EEG-Text pairs that have similar semantic meanings. Experimental results on the Zurich Cognitive Language Processing Corpus (ZuCo) demonstrate the effectiveness of SEE, which enhances the feasibility of accurate EEG-to-Text decoding.</description>

      <title>GATher: Graph Attention Based Predictions of Gene-Disease Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target selection is crucial in pharmaceutical drug discovery, directly influencing clinical trial success. Despite its importance, drug development remains resource-intensive, often taking over a decade with significant financial costs. High failure rates highlight the need for better early-stage target selection. We present GATher, a graph attention network designed to predict therapeutic gene-disease links by integrating data from diverse biomedical sources into a graph with over 4.4 million edges. GATher incorporates GATv3, a novel graph attention convolution layer, and GATv3HeteroConv, which aggregates transformations for each edge type, enhancing its ability to manage complex interactions within this extensive dataset. Utilizing hard negative sampling and multi-task pre-training, GATher addresses topological imbalances and improves specificity. Trained on data up to 2018 and evaluated through 2024, our results show GATher predicts clinical trial outcomes with a ROC AUC of 0.69 for unmet efficacy failures and 0.79 for positive efficacy. Feature attribution methods, using Captum, highlight key nodes and relationships, enhancing model interpretability. By 2024, GATher improved precision in prioritizing the top 200 clinical trial targets to 14.1%, an absolute increase of over 3.5% compared to other methods. GATher outperforms existing models like GAT, GATv2, and HGT in predicting clinical trial outcomes, demonstrating its potential in enhancing target validation and predicting clinical efficacy and safety.</description>

      <title>MRI Radiomics for IDH Genotype Prediction in Glioblastoma Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiomics is a relatively new field which utilises automatically identified features from radiological scans. It has found a widespread application, particularly in oncology because many of the important oncological biomarkers are not visible to the naked eye. The recent advent of big data, including in medical imaging, and the development of new ML techniques brought the possibility of faster and more accurate oncological diagnosis. Furthermore, standardised mathematical feature extraction based on radiomics helps to eliminate possible radiologist bias. This paper reviews the recent development in the oncological use of MRI radiomic features. It focuses on the identification of the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status, which is an important biomarker for the diagnosis of glioblastoma and grade IV astrocytoma.</description>

      <title>SOWAHA as a Potential Carcinoma Biomarker Impact Metabolic Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SOWAHA is a protein-coding gene, also known as ANKRD43. Studies have indicated that SOWAHA can serve as a prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer. However, there are few reports about SOWAHA in other types of cancer and the specific mechanism of action of SOWAHA in cancer is also not clear. Based on National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas (HPA), IntOGen, etc., we adopted bioinformatics methods to uncover the potential tumor genomic features of SOWAHA, including the correlation with prognosis, gene mutation, immune cell infiltration, and DNA methylation in different tumors, and evaluated the association with tumor heterogeneity, stemness, chemokines chemokine receptors, and immunomodulators in pan-cancer. Besides, we knocked down SOWAHA in SW620 cells and performed RNA-seq analysis, then we conducted functional enrichment to uncover the biological significance of the gene set. SOWAHA has early diagnostic potential, and low expression of SOWAHA was associated with poor prognosis in was associated with poor prognosis in GBMLGG, PAAD, READ, etc. SOWAHA is associated with most tumor immune-infiltrating cells in pan-cancer. Additionally, SOWAHA correlates with DNA methylation, tumor heterogeneity, and stemness in many epithelial carcinoma. Furthermore, our experiments showed that SOWAHA is involved in cancer pathways, mainly metabolic pathways in cancer and PI3K-AKT and JAK-STAT pathways. Additionally, we identified two potential transcription factors of SOWAHA, TBX4 and FOXP2, which are dysregulated in SW620 cells. SOWAHA influences the progression of colorectal cancer mainly via metabolic pathway, and suggested that SOWAHA could serve as an indicator for diagnosis, prognosis, and immunotherapy in some carcinomas, especially colorectal carcinoma.</description>

      <title>Large-scale digital phenotyping: identifying depression and anxiety indicators in a general UK population with over 10,000 participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital phenotyping offers a novel and cost-efficient approach for managing depression and anxiety. Previous studies, often limited to small-to-medium or specific populations, may lack generalizability. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from 10,129 participants recruited from a UK-based general population between June 2020 and August 2022. Participants shared wearable (Fitbit) data and self-reported questionnaires on depression (PHQ-8), anxiety (GAD-7), and mood via a study app. We first examined the correlations between PHQ-8/GAD-7 scores and wearable-derived features, demographics, health data, and mood assessments. Subsequently, unsupervised clustering was used to identify behavioural patterns associated with depression or anxiety. Finally, we employed separate XGBoost models to predict depression and anxiety and compared the results using different subsets of features. We observed significant associations between the severity of depression and anxiety with several factors, including mood, age, gender, BMI, sleep patterns, physical activity, and heart rate. Clustering analysis revealed that participants simultaneously exhibiting lower physical activity levels and higher heart rates reported more severe symptoms. Prediction models incorporating all types of variables achieved the best performance ($R^2$=0.41, MAE=3.42 for depression; $R^2$=0.31, MAE=3.50 for anxiety) compared to those using subsets of variables. This study identified potential indicators for depression and anxiety, highlighting the utility of digital phenotyping and machine learning technologies for rapid screening of mental disorders in general populations. These findings provide robust real-world insights for future healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>To Explore the Potential Inhibitors against Multitarget Proteins of COVID 19 using In Silico Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global pandemic due to emergence of COVID 19 has created the unrivaled public health crisis. It has huge morbidity rate never comprehended in the recent decades. Researchers have made many efforts to find the optimal solution of this pandemic. Progressively, drug repurposing is an emergent and powerful strategy with saving cost, time, and labor. Lacking of identified repurposed drug candidates against COVID 19 demands more efforts to explore the potential inhibitors for effective cure. In this study, we used the combination of molecular docking and machine learning regression approaches to explore the potential inhibitors for the treatment of COVID 19. We calculated the binding affinities of these drugs to multitarget proteins using molecular docking process. We perform the QSAR modeling by employing various machine learning regression approaches to identify the potential inhibitors against COVID 19. Our findings with best scores of R2 and RMSE demonstrated that our proposed Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model is the most appropriate model to explore the potential inhibitors. We proposed five novel promising inhibitors with their respective Zinc IDs ZINC (3873365, 85432544, 8214470, 85536956, and 261494640) within the range of -19.7 kcal/mol to -12.6 kcal/mol. We further analyzed the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of these most potent inhibitors to examine their behavior. The analysis of these properties is the key factor to promote an effective cure for public health. Our work constructs an efficient structure with which to probe the potential inhibitors against COVID-19, creating the combination of molecular docking with machine learning regression approaches.</description>

      <title>ECG-Image-Database: A Dataset of ECG Images with Real-World Imaging and Scanning Artifacts; A Foundation for Computerized ECG Image Digitization and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the ECG-Image-Database, a large and diverse collection of electrocardiogram (ECG) images generated from ECG time-series data, with real-world scanning, imaging, and physical artifacts. We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts.
  The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms.
  ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.</description>

      <title>A Grasping Movement Intention Estimator for Intuitive Control of Assistive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces i-GRIP, an innovative movement goal estimator designed to facilitate the control of assistive devices for grasping tasks in individuals with upperlimb impairments. The algorithm operates within a collaborative control paradigm, eliminating the need for specific user actions apart from naturally moving their hand toward a desired object. i-GRIP analyzes the hand's movement in an object-populated scene to determine its target and select an appropriate grip. In an experimental study involving 11 healthy participants, i-GRIP showed promising goal estimation performances and responsiveness and the potential to facilitate the daily use of assistive devices for individuals with upper-limb impairments in the future.</description>

      <title>Aggregating multiple test results to improve medical decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gathering observational data for medical decision-making often involves uncertainties arising from both type I (false positive)and type II (false negative) errors. In this work, we develop a statistical model to study how medical decision-making can be improved by repeating diagnostic and screening tests, and aggregating their results. This approach is relevant not only in clinical settings, such as medical imaging, but also in public health, as highlighted by the need for rapid, cost-effective testing methods during the SARS-CoV-2pandemic. Our model enables the development of testing protocols with an arbitrary number of tests, which can be customized to meet requirements for type I and type II errors. This allows us to adjust sensitivity and specificity according to application-specific needs. Additionally, we derive generalized Rogan--Gladen estimates for estimating disease prevalence, accounting for an arbitrary number of tests with potentially different type I and type II errors. We also provide the corresponding uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Robust estimation of end-of-outbreak probabilities in the presence of delayed and incomplete case reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards the end of an infectious disease outbreak, when a period has elapsed without new case notifications, a key question for public health policy makers is whether the outbreak can be declared over. This requires the benefits of a declaration (e.g., relaxation of outbreak control measures) to be balanced against the risk of a resurgence in cases. To support this decision making, mathematical methods have been developed to quantify the end-of-outbreak probability. Here, we propose a new approach to this problem that accounts for a range of features of real-world outbreaks, specifically: (i) incomplete case ascertainment; (ii) reporting delays; (iii) individual heterogeneity in transmissibility; and (iv) whether cases were imported or infected locally. We showcase our approach using two case studies: Covid-19 in New Zealand in 2020, and Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018. In these examples, we found that the date when the estimated probability of no future infections reached 95% was relatively consistent across a range of modelling assumptions. This suggests that our modelling framework can generate robust quantitative estimates that can be used by policy advisors, alongside other sources of evidence, to inform end-of-outbreak declarations.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in flow cytometry using a cell sorter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cytometry, it is difficult to disentangle the contributions of population variance and instrument noise towards total measured variation. Fundamentally, this is due to the fact that one cannot measure the same particle multiple times. We propose a simple experiment that uses a cell sorter to distinguish instrument-specific variation. For a population of beads whose intensities are distributed around a single peak, the sorter is used to collect beads whose measured intensities lie below some threshold. This subset of particles is then remeasured. If the variation in the measured values is only due to the sample, the second set of measurements should also lie entirely below our threshold. Any 'spillover' is therefore due to instrument specific effects - we demonstrate how the distribution of the post-sort measurements is sufficient to extract an estimate of the cumulative variability induced by the instrument. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we do not make any assumptions about the sources of said noise. We then show how 'local affine transformations' let us transfer these estimates to cytometers not equipped with a sorter. We use our analysis to estimate noise for a set of three instruments and two bead types, across a range of sample flow rates. Lastly, we discuss the implications of instrument noise on optimal classification, as well as other applications.</description>

      <title>Improving Performance in Colorectal Cancer Histology Decomposition using Deep and Ensemble Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In routine colorectal cancer management, histologic samples stained with hematoxylin and eosin are commonly used. Nonetheless, their potential for defining objective biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment selection is still being explored. The current gold standard relies on expensive and time-consuming genetic tests. However, recent research highlights the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in facilitating the extraction of clinically relevant biomarkers from these readily available images. These CNN-based biomarkers can predict patient outcomes comparably to golden standards, with the added advantages of speed, automation, and minimal cost. The predictive potential of CNN-based biomarkers fundamentally relies on the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify diverse tissue types from whole slide microscope images accurately. Consequently, enhancing the accuracy of tissue class decomposition is critical to amplifying the prognostic potential of imaging-based biomarkers. This study introduces a hybrid Deep and ensemble machine learning model that surpassed all preceding solutions for this classification task. Our model achieved 96.74% accuracy on the external test set and 99.89% on the internal test set. Recognizing the potential of these models in advancing the task, we have made them publicly available for further research and development.</description>
