      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Some application of Grunsky coefficients in the theory of univalent functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.11945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let function $f$ be normalized, analytic and univalent in the unit disk ${\mathbb D}=\{z:|z|&lt;1\}$ and $f(z)=z+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} a_n z^n$. Using a method based on Grusky coefficients we study several problems over that class of univalent functions: upper bounds of the special case of the generalised Zalcman conjecture $|a_2a_3-a_4|$, of the third logarithmic coefficient, and of the second Hankel determinant for the logarithmic coefficients.</description>

      <title>Bergman representative coordinate, constant holomorphic curvature and a multidimensional generalization of Carath\'eodory's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08741v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By using the Bergman representative coordinate and Calabi's diastasis, we extend a theorem of Lu to bounded pseudoconvex domains whose Bergman metric is incomplete with constant holomorphic sectional curvature. We characterize such domains that are biholomorphic to a ball possibly less a relatively closed pluripolar set. We also provide a multidimensional generalization of Carath\'eodory's theorem on the continuous extension of the biholomorphisms up to the closures. In particular, sufficient conditions are given, in terms of the Bergman kernel, for the boundary of a biholomorphic ball to be a topological sphere.</description>

      <title>On the Commuting Problem of Toeplitz Operators on the Harmonic Bergman Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a complete characterization of bounded Toeplitz operators $T_f$ on the harmonic Bergman space of the unit disk, where the symbol $f$ has a polar decomposition truncated above, that commute with $T_{z+\bar{g}}$, for a bounded analytic function $g$.</description>

      <title>Optimal growth of upper frequently hypercyclic functions for some weighted Taylor shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.03159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the optimal growth in terms of $L^p$-averages of hypercyclic and $\mathcal{U}$-frequently hypercyclic functions for some weighted Taylor shift operators acting on the space of analytic function on the unit disc. We unify the results obtained by considering intermediate notions of upper frequent hypercyclicity between the $\mathcal{U}$-frequent hypercyclicity and the hypercyclicity.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition is widely used in modal analysis, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and resolvent analysis, to extract key features from complex problems. SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by calculating the derivatives of singular values with respect to the snapshot matrix derived from the POD of a large dataset for a laminar-turbulent transitional flow over a flat plate, sourced from the John Hopkins turbulence database.</description>
