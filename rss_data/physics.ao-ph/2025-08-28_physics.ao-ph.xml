      <title>A Constructed Closure of the Bering Strait can Prevent an AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a major tipping element in the present-day climate, and could potentially collapse under sufficient freshwater or CO2-forcing. While the effect of the Bering Strait on AMOC stability has been well studied, it is unknown whether a constructed closure of this Strait can prevent an AMOC collapse under climate change. Here, we show in an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity that an artificial closure of the Strait can extend the safe carbon budget of the AMOC, provided that the AMOC is strong enough at the closure time. Specifically, for this model, an equilibrium AMOC with a reduction below (6.1+/-0.5)% from pre-industrial has an additional budget up to 500PgC given a sufficiently early closure, while for a weaker AMOC a closure reduces this budget. This indicates that constructing this closure can be a feasible climate intervention strategy to prevent an AMOC collapse.</description>

      <title>Accounting for shelf width in selecting altimetry observations for coastal sea level variability improves its agreement with tide gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel dynamically varying search radius algorithm is developed that takes advantage of bathymetry information to choose satellite observations that represent coastal sea level variability better. The algorithm is successfully tested at 155 tide gauge stations around the globe and demonstrates broader applicability across different coastal regimes compared to existing validation methods. This is supported by consistently higher median correlation and lower median Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE). Furthermore, the new algorithm improves the efficacy of the low-resolution product, X-TRACK SLA L2P v2022 (XTRACK), and makes it comparable to the high-resolution (20Hz) coastal products: Along-track sea level anomalies and trends v2.3. Using the algorithm at over 267 stations, XTRACK data shows improved agreement with tide gauges for both linear and non-linear trends. In some regions, such as tidally-dominated estuaries and the Eastern Australian coast, lower correlation and higher RMSE for residual signals are reported, which are discussed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Deterministic Freezing Level Predictions in the Northern Sierra Nevada Through Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the freezing level is essential for hydrometeorological forecasting systems, with direct implications for runoff generation and reservoir management. In this study, we develop a deep learning based postprocessing framework using the Unet convolutional neural network architecture to refine the FZL forecasts from the West Weather Research and Forecasting West WRF model. The proposed framework leverages reforecast data from West WRF and FZL estimates from the California Nevada River Forecast Center to develop Unet models over the northern Sierra Nevada watersheds, such as the hydrologically critical Yuba Feather watershed. We introduce two Unet model variants, Unet_log and Unet_GMM, that employ specialized loss functions beyond the standard benchmarks to enhance forecast skill. Unet_log utilizes the cosine of Error, and Unet_MM uses Gaussian Mixture Model loss functions, to enhance FZL forecasts. Results show that Unet based postprocessing reduces centered root mean squared errors by up to 20% and increases forecast observation correlation by about 10% compared to raw WestWRF. Evaluation using the continuous ranked probability score for Unet_GMM further demonstrates consistent improvements across lead times. While performance fluctuates with forecast horizon, storm variability, and diurnal forcing, Unet_GMM and Unet_log consistently outperform the baseline. The models capture the spatiotemporal variability of the FZL across different elevations, mitigating biases from the West WRF model. This novel deep learning based postprocessing approach demonstrates a promising pathway for integrating machine learning into hydrometeorological forecasting and decision support within the Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations framework.</description>

      <title>Stability analyses of divergence and vorticity damping on gnomonic cubed-sphere grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divergence and vorticity damping, which operate upon horizontal divergence and relative vorticity, are explicit diffusion mechanisms used in dynamical cores to ensure numerical stability. There are mesh-dependent upper bounds on the coefficients of these diffusion operators, else the diffusion itself instigates model instability. This work considers such stability limits for three gnomonic cubed-sphere meshes -- 1) equidistant, 2) equiangular, and 3) equi-edge mappings. Von Neumann analysis is used to derive linear stability limits, and these depend on the cell areas and aspect ratios of the cubed-sphere grid. The linear theory is compared to practical divergence and vorticity damping limits in NOAA GFDL's finite-volume dynamical core on the cubed-sphere (FV3), using a baroclinic wave initial condition and the equiangular and equi-edge grids. For divergence damping, both the magnitude of maximum stable coefficients and the locations of instability agree with linear theory. Due to implicit vorticity diffusion from the transport scheme, practical limits for vorticity damping are lower than the explicit stability limits. The maximum allowable vorticity damping coefficient is dependent on the choice of horizontal transport scheme for the equi-edge grid; it is hypothesised that this indicates the relative implicit diffusion of the transport scheme in this test.</description>
