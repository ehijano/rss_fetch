      <title>CoFormer: Collaborating with Heterogeneous Edge Devices for Scalable Transformer Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impressive performance of transformer models has sparked the deployment of intelligent applications on resource-constrained edge devices. However, ensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant challenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource requirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload transformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models on individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either considerable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative inference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central idea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of transformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple smaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are aggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem to minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous hardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the optimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively calibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the capability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge devices, achieving up to 3.1$\times$ inference speedup with large transformer models. Notably, CoFormer enables the efficient inference of GPT2-XL with 1.6 billion parameters on edge devices, reducing memory requirements by 76.3\%. CoFormer can also reduce energy consumption by approximately 40\% while maintaining satisfactory inference performance.</description>

      <title>Blind Source Separation-Enabled Joint Communication and Sensing in IBFD MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of joint communication and sensing (JCAS) in next-generation wireless networks, with an emphasis on in-band full-duplex (IBFD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Traditionally, self-interference (SI) in IBFD systems is a major obstacle to recovering the signal of interest (SOI). Under the JCAS paradigm, however, this high-power SI signal presents an opportunity for efficient sensing. Since each transceiver node has access to the original SI signal, its environmental reflections can be exploited to estimate channel conditions and detect changes, without requiring dedicated radar waveforms. We propose a blind source separation (BSS)-based framework to simultaneously perform self-interference cancellation (SIC) and extract sensing information in IBFD MIMO settings. The approach applies the Fast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithm to separate the SI and SOI signals while enabling simultaneous signal recovery and channel estimation. Simulation results confirm the framework's effectiveness, showing improved sensing and communication performance as signal frame size increases.</description>
