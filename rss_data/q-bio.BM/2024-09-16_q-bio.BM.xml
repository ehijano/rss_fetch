      <title>Quantum-inspired Reinforcement Learning for Synthesizable Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesizable molecular design (also known as synthesizable molecular optimization) is a fundamental problem in drug discovery, and involves designing novel molecular structures to improve their properties according to drug-relevant oracle functions (i.e., objective) while ensuring synthetic feasibility. However, existing methods are mostly based on random search. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach using the reinforcement learning method with quantum-inspired simulated annealing policy neural network to navigate the vast discrete space of chemical structures intelligently. Specifically, we employ a deterministic REINFORCE algorithm using policy neural networks to output transitional probability to guide state transitions and local search using genetic algorithm to refine solutions to a local optimum within each iteration. Our methods are evaluated with the Practical Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark framework with a 10K query budget. We further showcase the competitive performance of our method by comparing it against the state-of-the-art genetic algorithms-based method.</description>

      <title>Mechanosensitive ion channels: Old but new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ion channels orchestrate the communication between cells and their environment. These are special proteins capable of changing their shape to allow ions to pass through membranes in response to stimuli like membrane tension. As the letters are written and exchanged in the form of ionic currents, the energetic cost of this communication is of interest to many. To this end, we introduce the nanoscale thermodynamics of mechanosensitive ion channels, which amounts to defining work and heat for traces obtained during patch-clamp experiments. We also discuss the interplay between ion channel physics and evolution by showing how information-processing capabilities are coupled with the energy landscapes of channels.</description>

      <title>One-way catalysis: Insights from a solvable lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catalysts speed up chemical reactions with no energy input and without being transformed in the process, therefore leaving equilibrium constants unchanged. Some catalysts, however, are much more efficient at accelerating one direction of a reaction. How is such an asymmetry consistent with chemical equilibrium, where as many forward and reverse reactions must occur? We use the rigorous framework of a simple but exactly solvable lattice model to study this question in the context of a strictly one-way catalyst, which can only accelerate one way of a reaction. The model illustrates a mathematical relationship between asymmetric transition rates, which underlie directional catalysis, and symmetric transition fluxes, which underlie chemical equilibrium. The degree of directionality generally depends on the catalytic mechanism and we compare different mechanisms to show how they can obey different scaling laws. The results showcase the ability of simple physical models to address fundamental questions in catalysis.</description>

      <title>GFlowNet Pretraining with Inexpensive Rewards</title>

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), a class of generative models have recently emerged as a suitable framework for generating diverse and high-quality molecular structures by learning from unnormalized reward distributions. Previous works in this direction often restrict exploration by using predefined molecular fragments as building blocks, limiting the chemical space that can be accessed. In this work, we introduce Atomic GFlowNets (A-GFNs), a foundational generative model leveraging individual atoms as building blocks to explore drug-like chemical space more comprehensively. We propose an unsupervised pre-training approach using offline drug-like molecule datasets, which conditions A-GFNs on inexpensive yet informative molecular descriptors such as drug-likeliness, topological polar surface area, and synthetic accessibility scores. These properties serve as proxy rewards, guiding A-GFNs towards regions of chemical space that exhibit desirable pharmacological properties. We further our method by implementing a goal-conditioned fine-tuning process, which adapts A-GFNs to optimize for specific target properties. In this work, we pretrain A-GFN on the ZINC15 offline dataset and employ robust evaluation metrics to show the effectiveness of our approach when compared to other relevant baseline methods in drug design.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Deep Generative Model For Computational Protein Design And Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17241</link>

Abstract: Proteins are the fundamental macromolecules that play diverse and crucial roles in all living matter and have tremendous implications in healthcare, manufacturing, and biotechnology. Their functions are largely determined by the sequences of amino acids that compose them and their unique three-dimensional structures when folded. The recent surge in highly accurate computational protein structure prediction tools has equipped scientists with the means to derive preliminary structural insights without the onerous costs of experimental structure determination. These breakthroughs hold profound promise for building robust and efficient in silico protein design systems.
  While the prospect of designing de novo proteins with precise computational accuracy remains a grand challenge in biochemical engineering, conventional assembly-based and rational design methods often grapple with the expansive design space, resulting in suboptimal design success rates. Despite recently emerged deep learning-based models have shown promise in improving the efficiency of the computational protein design process, a significant gap persists between current design paradigms and their experimental realization. This thesis will investigate the potential of deep generative models in refining protein structure and sequence design methods, aiming to develop frameworks capable of crafting novel protein sequences with predetermined structures or specific functionalities. By harnessing extensive protein databases and cutting-edge neural architectures, this research aims to enhance precision and robustness in current protein design paradigms, potentially paving the way for advancements across various scientific fields.</description>
