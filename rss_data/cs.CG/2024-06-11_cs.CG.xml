      <title>The dual of Philo's shortest line segment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dual of Philo's shortest line segment problem which asks to find the optimal line segments passing through two given points, with a common endpoint, and with the other endpoints on a given line. The provided solution uses multivariable calculus and geometry methods. Interesting connections with the angle bisector of the triangle are explored.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Vertex Guarding for Simple and Non-Simple Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Dispersive Art Gallery Problem with vertex guards: Given a polygon $\mathcal{P}$, with pairwise geodesic Euclidean vertex distance of at least $1$, and a rational number $\ell$; decide whether there is a set of vertex guards such that $\mathcal{P}$ is guarded, and the minimum geodesic Euclidean distance between any two guards (the so-called dispersion distance) is at least $\ell$.
  We show that it is NP-complete to decide whether a polygon with holes has a set of vertex guards with dispersion distance $2$. On the other hand, we provide an algorithm that places vertex guards in simple polygons at dispersion distance at least $2$. This result is tight, as there are simple polygons in which any vertex guard set has a dispersion distance of at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Minimum Homology Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a minimum homology basis, that is, a lightest set of cycles that generates the $1$-dimensional homology classes with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients in a given simplicial complex $K$. This problem has been extensively studied in the last few years. For general complexes, the current best deterministic algorithm, by Dey et al., runs in $O(N m^{\omega-1} + n m g)$ time, where $N$ denotes the total number of simplices in $K$, $m$ denotes the number of edges in $K$, $n$ denotes the number of vertices in $K$, $g$ denotes the rank of the $1$-homology group of $K$, and $\omega$ denotes the exponent of matrix multiplication. In this paper, we present three conceptually simple randomized algorithms that compute a minimum homology basis of a general simplicial complex $K$. The first algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time, the second algorithm runs in $O(N m^{\omega-1})$ time and the third algorithm runs in $\tilde{O}(N^2 g + N m g{^2} + m g{^3})$ time which is nearly quadratic time when $g=O(1)$. We also study the problem of finding a minimum cycle basis in an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The best known algorithm for this problem runs in $O(m^\omega)$ time. Our algorithm, which has a simpler high-level description, but is slightly more expensive, runs in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time.
  We also provide a practical implementation of computing the minimum homology basis for general weighted complexes. The implementation is broadly based on the algorithmic ideas described in this paper, differing in its use of practical subroutines. Of these subroutines, the more costly step makes use of a parallel implementation, thus potentially addressing the issue of scale. We compare results against the currently known state of the art implementation (ShortLoop).</description>

      <title>Extraction of Singular Patterns from a Vector Field via Persistent Path Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraction of singular patterns is a fundamental problem in theoretical and practical domains due to the ability of such patterns to detect the intrinsic characteristics of vector fields. In this study, we propose an approach for extracting singular patterns from discrete planar vector fields. Our method involves converting the planar discrete vector field into a specialized digraph and computing its one-dimensional persistent path homology. By analyzing the persistence diagram, we can determine the location of singularity and segment a region of the singular pattern, which is referred to as a singular polygon. Moreover, the variations of singular patterns can also be analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in analyzing the centers and impact areas of tropical cyclones, positioning the dip poles from geomagnetic fields, and measuring variations of singular patterns between vector fields.</description>

      <title>Warp-centric GPU meta-meshing and fast triangulation of billion-scale lattice structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice structures have been widely used in applications due to their superior mechanical properties. To fabricate such structures, a geometric processing step called triangulation is often employed to transform them into the STL format before sending them to 3D printers. Because lattice structures tend to have high geometric complexity, this step usually generates a large amount of triangles, a memory and compute-intensive task. This problem manifests itself clearly through large-scale lattice structures that have millions or billions of struts. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transform a lattice structure into an intermediate model called meta-mesh before undergoing real triangulation. Compared to triangular meshes, meta-meshes are very lightweight and much less compute-demanding. The meta-mesh can also work as a base mesh reusable for conveniently and efficiently triangulating lattice structures with arbitrary resolutions. A CPU+GPU asynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate meta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU algorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric design paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data compression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced scheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch divergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the proposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously achievable.</description>

      <title>Discrete Microlocal Morse Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish several results combining discrete Morse theory and microlocal sheaf theory in the setting of finite posets and simplicial complexes. Our primary tool is a computationally tractable description of the bounded derived category of sheaves on a poset with the Alexandrov topology. We prove that each bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset admits a unique (up to isomorphism of complexes) minimal injective resolution, and we provide algorithms for computing minimal injective resolution of an injective complex, as well as several useful functors between derived categories of sheaves. For the constant sheaf on a simplicial complex, we give asymptotically tight bounds on the complexity of computing the minimal injective resolution using those algorithms. Our main result is a novel definition of the discrete microsupport of a bounded complex of sheaves on a finite poset. We detail several foundational properties of the discrete microsupport, as well as a microlocal generalization of the discrete homological Morse theorem and Morse inequalities.</description>
