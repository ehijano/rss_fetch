      <title>Efficient 4D Radar Data Auto-labeling Method using LiDAR-based Object Detection Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing on the strength of 4D (4-Dimensional) radar, research about robust 3D object detection networks in adverse weather conditions has gained attention. To train such networks, datasets that contain large amounts of 4D radar data and ground truth labels are essential. However, the existing 4D radar datasets (e.g., K-Radar) lack sufficient sensor data and labels, which hinders the advancement in this research domain. Furthermore, enlarging the 4D radar datasets requires a time-consuming and expensive manual labeling process. To address these issues, we propose the auto-labeling method of 4D radar tensor (4DRT) in the K-Radar dataset. The proposed method initially trains a LiDAR-based object detection network (LODN) using calibrated LiDAR point cloud (LPC). The trained LODN then automatically generates ground truth labels (i.e., auto-labels, ALs) of the K-Radar train dataset without human intervention. The generated ALs are used to train the 4D radar-based object detection network (4DRODN), Radar Tensor Network with Height (RTNH). The experimental results demonstrate that RTNH trained with ALs has achieved a similar detection performance to the original RTNH which is trained with manually annotated ground truth labels, thereby verifying the effectiveness of the proposed auto-labeling method. All relevant codes will be soon available at the following GitHub project: https://github.com/kaist-avelab/K-Radar</description>

      <title>Efficient Hybrid Neuromorphic-Bayesian Model for Olfaction Sensing: Detection and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olfaction sensing in autonomous robotics faces challenges in dynamic operations, energy efficiency, and edge processing. It necessitates a machine learning algorithm capable of managing real-world odor interference, ensuring resource efficiency for mobile robotics, and accurately estimating gas features for critical tasks such as odor mapping, localization, and alarm generation. This paper introduces a hybrid approach that exploits neuromorphic computing in combination with probabilistic inference to address these demanding requirements. Our approach implements a combination of a convolutional spiking neural network for feature extraction and a Bayesian spiking neural network for odor detection and identification. The developed algorithm is rigorously tested on a dataset for sensor drift compensation for robustness evaluation. Additionally, for efficiency evaluation, we compare the energy consumption of our model with a non-spiking machine learning algorithm under identical dataset and operating conditions. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency alongside comparable accuracy outcomes.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Weather Radar Calibration: A Theoretical Model for Wind Influence on Metal Sphere Reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calibration of weather radar for detecting meteorological phenomena has advanced rapidly, aiming to enhance accuracy. Utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a suspended metal sphere introduces an efficient calibration method by allowing dynamic adjustment of the UAV's position, effectively acting as a mobile calibration platform. However, external factors such as wind can introduce bias in reflectivity measurements by causing the sphere to deviate from its intended position. This study develops a theoretical model to assess the impact of the metal sphere's one-dimensional oscillation on reflectivity. The findings offer valuable insights for UAV based radar calibration efforts.</description>

      <title>Laser driven miniature diamond implant for wireless retinal prostheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and benchtop operation of a wireless miniature epiretinal stimulator implant is reported. The implant is optically powered and controlled using safe illumination at near-infrared wavelengths. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) hosting a digital control unit is used to control the implant's electrodes. The ASIC is powered using an advanced photovoltaic (PV) cell and programmed using a single photodiode. Diamond packaging technology is utilized to achieve high-density integration of the implant optoelectronic circuitry, as well as individual connections between a stimulator chip and 256 electrodes, within a 4.6 mm x 3.7 mm x 0.9 mm implant package. An ultrahigh efficiency PV cell with a monochromatic power conversion efficiency of 55% is used to power the implant. On-board photodetection circuity with a bandwidth of 3.7 MHz is used for forward data telemetry of stimulation parameters. In comparison to implants which utilize inductively coupled coils, laser power delivery enables a high degree of miniaturization and lower surgical complexity. The device presented combines the benefits of implant miniaturization and a flexible stimulation strategy provided by a dedicated stimulator chip. This development provides a route to fully wireless miniaturized minimally invasive implants with sophisticated functionalities.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification of PWR Crud-Induced Power Shift Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Crud-Induced Power Shift (CIPS) is an operational challenge in Pressurized Water Reactors that is due to the development of crud on the fuel rod cladding. The available predictive tools developed previously, usually based on fundamental physics, are computationally expensive and have shown differing degrees of accuracy. This work proposes a completely top-down approach to predict CIPS instances on an assembly level with reactor-specific calibration built-in. Built using artificial neural networks, this work uses a three-dimensional convolutional approach to leverage the image-like layout of the input data. As a classifier, the convolutional neural network model predicts whether a given assembly will experience CIPS as well as the time of occurrence during a given cycle. This surrogate model is both trained and tested using a combination of calculated core model parameters and measured plant data from Unit 1 of the Catawba Nuclear Station. After the evaluation of its performance using various metrics, Monte Carlo dropout is employed for extensive uncertainty quantification of the model predictions. The results indicate that this methodology could be a viable approach in predicting CIPS with an assembly-level resolution across both clean and afflicted cycles, while using limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Embedding of Single Channel Electroencephalogram for Artifact Subspace Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework to apply Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm on single-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. ASR, renowned for its automated capability to effectively eliminate various artifacts like eye-blinks and eye movements from EEG signals. Importantly it has been implemented on android smartphones, but relied on multiple channels for principal component subspace calculations. To overcome this limitation, we incorporate the established dynamical embedding approach into the algorithm, naming it Embedded-ASR (E-ASR). In our proposed method, an embedded matrix is first constructed from a single-channel EEG data using series of delay vectors. ASR is then applied to this embedded matrix, and the resulting cleaned single-channel EEG is reconstructed by removing the time lag and concatenating the rows of the embedded matrix. Data was collected from four subjects in resting states with eyes open from pre-frontal (Fp1 and Fp2) electrodes using CameraEEG app. To assess the effectiveness of the E-ASR algorithm on an EEG dataset with artifacts, we employed performance metrics such as relative root mean square error (RRMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), average power ratio as well as estimated the number of eye-blinks with and without the E-ASR approach. E-ASR was able to reduce artifacts from the semi-simulated EEG data, with an RRMSE of 45.45% and a CC of 0.91. For real EEG data, the counted eye-blinks were manually cross-checked with ground truth obtained from CameraEEG video data across all subjects for individual Fp1 and Fp2 electrodes. In conclusion, our study suggests E-ASR framework can remove artifacts from single channel EEG data. This promising algorithm might have potential for smartphone-based natural environment EEG applications, where minimal number of electrodes is a critical factor.</description>

      <title>Classifying active and inactive states of growing rabbits from accelerometer data using machine learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how wearable accelerometers, small devices that measure acceleration, can help monitor the activity of growing rabbits. We equipped 16 rabbits with these devices and filmed them for two weeks. By watching the videos and using a special software we figure out what the rabbits were doing -- things like lying down, eating, moving around, and more. These activitties were grouped into two states: active or inactive. Then, this information along acceleration data was used to teach a computer program to recognize when the rabbits were active or not. This technology offers a reliable way to understand rabbit behavior, which could lead to better management practices in animal production.</description>

      <title>The OPS-SAT benchmark for detecting anomalies in satellite telemetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting anomalous events in satellite telemetry is a critical task in space operations. This task, however, is extremely time-consuming, error-prone and human dependent, thus automated data-driven anomaly detection algorithms have been emerging at a steady pace. However, there are no publicly available datasets of real satellite telemetry accompanied with the ground-truth annotations that could be used to train and verify anomaly detection supervised models. In this article, we address this research gap and introduce the AI-ready benchmark dataset (OPSSAT-AD) containing the telemetry data acquired on board OPS-SAT -- a CubeSat mission which has been operated by the European Space Agency which has come to an end during the night of 22--23 May 2024 (CEST). The dataset is accompanied with the baseline results obtained using 30 supervised and unsupervised classic and deep machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection. They were trained and validated using the training-test dataset split introduced in this work, and we present a suggested set of quality metrics which should be always calculated to confront the new algorithms for anomaly detection while exploiting OPSSAT-AD. We believe that this work may become an important step toward building a fair, reproducible and objective validation procedure that can be used to quantify the capabilities of the emerging anomaly detection techniques in an unbiased and fully transparent way.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Identification in Mobile Networks: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks heralds a transformative era for mobile communication, where the integration of cutting-edge technologies like Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) is paramount in addressing the burgeoning demands for energy efficiency, high data rates, reliable connectivity, and enhanced coverage in densely populated areas. RISs have attracted the attention of academia as well as the industry and emerged as a beacon of innovation, offering a novel paradigm to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment beneficially, thereby enhancing the overall network performance. It is envisioned that the deployment of numerous RISs in a mobile network will serve user equipments (UEs) to boost various key performance indicators (KPIs), with lower energy consumption compared to alternative solutions (e.g., relays, and network-controlled repeaters). However, the knowledge of whether or not a UE is being served through an RIS and if so, which RIS it is being served by is crucial and beneficial for various network planning and operational reasons. In this paper, we address the importance and the benefits of RIS identification in a mobile network. Additionally, we guide the readers and researchers by introducing alternative methods to enable RIS identification. Through the lens of this research, we unveil and shed light to various benefits, the challenges, and future opportunities in the identification of RISs serving mobile users in complex network environments, highlighting the necessity for advanced identification strategies to fully harness the potential of RIS technology in next-generation wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Accurate Passive Radar via an Uncertainty-Aware Fusion of Wi-Fi Sensing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi devices can effectively be used as passive radar systems that sense what happens in the surroundings and can even discern human activity. We propose, for the first time, a principled architecture which employs Variational Auto-Encoders for estimating a latent distribution responsible for generating the data, and Evidential Deep Learning for its ability to sense out-of-distribution activities. We verify that the fused data processed by different antennas of the same Wi-Fi receiver results in increased accuracy of human activity recognition compared with the most recent benchmarks, while still being informative when facing out-of-distribution samples and enabling semantic interpretation of latent variables in terms of physical phenomena. The results of this paper are a first contribution toward the ultimate goal of providing a flexible, semantic characterisation of black-swan events, i.e., events for which we have limited to no training data.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Fusion of Wi-Fi Sensing Data for Passive Radar with Inter-Modal Knowledge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wi-Fi devices, akin to passive radars, can discern human activities within indoor settings due to the human body's interaction with electromagnetic signals. Current Wi-Fi sensing applications predominantly employ data-driven learning techniques to associate the fluctuations in the physical properties of the communication channel with the human activity causing them. However, these techniques often lack the desired flexibility and transparency. This paper introduces DeepProbHAR, a neuro-symbolic architecture for Wi-Fi sensing, providing initial evidence that Wi-Fi signals can differentiate between simple movements, such as leg or arm movements, which are integral to human activities like running or walking. The neuro-symbolic approach affords gathering such evidence without needing additional specialised data collection or labelling. The training of DeepProbHAR is facilitated by declarative domain knowledge obtained from a camera feed and by fusing signals from various antennas of the Wi-Fi receivers. DeepProbHAR achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art in human activity recognition. Moreover, as a by-product of the learning process, DeepProbHAR generates specialised classifiers for simple movements that match the accuracy of models trained on finely labelled datasets, which would be particularly costly.</description>

      <title>SCDM: Unified Representation Learning for EEG-to-fNIRS Cross-Modal Generation in MI-BCIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs), which integrate both electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals, outperform those based solely on EEG. However, simultaneously recording EEG and fNIRS signals is highly challenging due to the difficulty of colocating both types of sensors on the same scalp surface. This physical constraint complicates the acquisition of high-quality hybrid signals, thereby limiting the widespread application of hybrid MI-BCIs. To facilitate the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals, this study proposes the spatio-temporal controlled diffusion model (SCDM) as a framework for cross-modal generation from EEG to fNIRS. The model utilizes two core modules, the spatial cross-modal generation (SCG) module and the multi-scale temporal representation (MTR) module, which adaptively learn the respective latent temporal and spatial representations of both signals in a unified representation space. The SCG module further maps EEG representations to fNIRS representations by leveraging their spatial relationships. Experimental results show high similarity between synthetic and real fNIRS signals. The joint classification performance of EEG and synthetic fNIRS signals is comparable to or even better than that of EEG with real fNIRS signals. Furthermore, the synthetic signals exhibit similar spatio-temporal features to real signals while preserving spatial relationships with EEG signals. Experimental results suggest that the SCDM may represent a promising paradigm for the acquisition of hybrid EEG-fNIRS signals in MI-BCI systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Decoupling Capacitor Optimization for Power Distribution Network of 2.5D ICs with Co-Analysis of Frequency and Time Domains Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing need for higher memory bandwidth and computation density, 2.5D design, which involves integrating multiple chiplets onto an interposer, emerges as a promising solution. However, this integration introduces significant challenges due to increasing data rates and a large number of I/Os, necessitating advanced optimization of the power distribution networks (PDNs) both on-chip and on-interposer to mitigate the small signal noise and simultaneous switching noise (SSN). Traditional PDN optimization strategies in 2.5D systems primarily focus on reducing impedance by integrating decoupling capacitors (decaps) to lessen small signal noises. Unfortunately, relying solely on frequency-domain analysis has been proven inadequate for addressing coupled SSN, as indicated by our experimental results. In this work, we introduce a novel two-phase optimization flow using deep reinforcement learning to tackle both the on-chip small signal noise and SSN. Initially, we optimize the impedance in the frequency domain to maintain the small signal noise within acceptable limits while avoiding over-design. Subsequently, in the time domain, we refine the PDN to minimize the voltage violation integral (VVI), a more accurate measure of SSN severity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dual-domain optimization strategy that simultaneously addresses both the small signal noise and SSN propagation through strategic decap placement in on-chip and on-interposer PDNs, offering a significant step forward in the design of robust PDNs for 2.5D integrated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ERP-based EEG detection is gaining increasing attention in the field of brain-computer interfaces. However, due to the complexity of ERP signal components, their low signal-to-noise ratio, and significant inter-subject variability, cross-subject ERP signal detection has been challenging. The continuous advancement in deep learning has greatly contributed to addressing this issue. This brief proposes a contrastive learning training framework and an Inception module to extract multi-scale temporal and spatial features, representing the subject-invariant components of ERP signals. Specifically, a base encoder integrated with a linear Inception module and a nonlinear projector is used to project the raw data into latent space. By maximizing signal similarity under different targets, the inter-subject EEG signal differences in latent space are minimized. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used for ERP target detection. The proposed algorithm achieved the best AUC performance in single-trial binary classification tasks on the P300 dataset and showed significant optimization in speller decoding tasks compared to existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Classification of Power Quality Disturbances Using Resnet with Channel Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and classification of power quality disturbances (PQDs) carries significant importance for power systems. In response to this imperative, numerous intelligent diagnostic methods have been developed. However, existing identification methods usually concentrate on single-type signals or on complex signals with two types, rendering them susceptible to noisy labels and environmental effects. This study proposes a novel method for the classification of PQDs, termed ST-GSResNet, which utilizes the S-Transform and an improved residual neural network (ResNet) with a channel attention mechanism. The ST-GSResNet approach initially uses the S-Transform to transform a time-series signal into a 2D time-frequency image for feature enhancement. Then, an improved ResNet model is introduced, which employs grouped convolution instead of the traditional convolution operation. This improvement aims to facilitate learning with a block-diagonal structured sparsity on the channel dimension, the highly-correlated filters are learned in a more structured way in the networks with filter groups. By reducing the number of parameters in the network in this significant manner, the model becomes less prone to overfitting. Furthermore, the SE module concentrates on primary components, which enhances the model's robustness in recognition and immunity to noise. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing deep learning models, our approach has advantages in computational efficiency and classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>Moving Target Detection Method Based on Range? Doppler Domain Compensation and Cancellation for UAV-Mounted Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with through-the-wall radar can realize moving targets detection in complex building scenes. However, clutters generated by obstacles and static objects are always stronger and non-stationary, which results in heavy impacts on moving targets detection. To address this issue, this paper proposes a moving target detection method based on Range-Doppler domain compensation and cancellation for UAV mounted dual channel radar. In the proposed method, phase compensation is performed on the dual channel in range-Doppler domain and then cancellation is utilized to achieve roughly clutters suppression. Next, a filter is constructed based on the cancellation result and the raw echoes, which is used to suppress stationary clutter furthermore. Finally, mismatch imaging is used to focus moving target for detection. Both simulation and UAV-based experiment results are analyzed to verify the efficacy and practicability of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Annotation of Sleep Depth Index with Scalable Deep Learning Yields Novel Digital Biomarkers for Sleep Health</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional sleep staging categorizes sleep and wakefulness into five coarse-grained classes, overlooking subtle variations within each stage. It provides limited information about the probability of arousal and may hinder the diagnosis of sleep disorders, such as insomnia. To address this issue, we propose a deep-learning method for automatic and scalable annotation of sleep depth index using existing sleep staging labels. Our approach is validated using polysomnography from over ten thousand recordings across four large-scale cohorts. The results show a strong correlation between the decrease in sleep depth index and the increase in arousal likelihood. Several case studies indicate that the sleep depth index captures more nuanced sleep structures than conventional sleep staging. Sleep biomarkers extracted from the whole-night sleep depth index exhibit statistically significant differences with medium-to-large effect sizes across groups of varied subjective sleep quality and insomnia symptoms. These sleep biomarkers also promise utility in predicting the severity of obstructive sleep apnea, particularly in severe cases. Our study underscores the utility of the proposed method for continuous sleep depth annotation, which could reveal more detailed structures and dynamics within whole-night sleep and yield novel digital biomarkers beneficial for sleep health.</description>

      <title>Defensive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (D-RIS) Based on Non-Reciprocal Channel Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is commonly made of low-cost passive and reflective meta-materials with excellent beam steering capabilities. It is applied to enhance wireless communication systems as a customizable signal reflector. However, RIS can also be adversely employed to disrupt the existing communication systems by introducing new types of vulnerability to the physical layer. We consider the \emph{RIS-In-The-Middle (RITM) attack}, in which an adversary uses RIS to jeopardize the direct channel between two transceivers by providing an alternative one with higher signal quality. This adversary can eavesdrop on all exchanged data by the legitimate users, but also perform a false data injection to the receiver. This work devises anti-attack techniques based on a non-reciprocal channel produced by a defensive RIS (D-RIS). The proposed precoding and combining methods and the channel estimation procedure for a non-reciprocal link are effective against potential adversaries while keeping the existing advantages of the RIS. We analyse the robustness of the system against attacks in terms of achievable secrecy rate and probability of detecting fake data. We believe that this defensive role of RIS can be a basis for new protocols and algorithms in the area.</description>

      <title>Flexible Antenna Arrays for Wireless Communications: Modeling and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible antenna arrays (FAAs), distinguished by their rotatable, bendable, and foldable properties, are extensively employed in flexible radio systems to achieve customized radiation patterns. This paper aims to illustrate that FAAs, capable of dynamically adjusting surface shapes, can enhance communication performances with both omni-directional and directional antenna patterns, in terms of multi-path channel power and channel angle Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds. To this end, we develop a mathematical model that elucidates the impacts of the variations in antenna positions and orientations as the array transitions from a flat to a rotated, bent, and folded state, all contingent on the flexible degree-of-freedom. Moreover, since the array shape adjustment operates across the entire beamspace, especially with directional patterns, we discuss the sum-rate in the multi-sector base station that covers the $360^\circ$ communication area. Particularly, to thoroughly explore the multi-sector sum-rate, we propose separate flexible precoding (SFP), joint flexible precoding (JFP), and semi-joint flexible precoding (SJFP), respectively. In our numerical analysis comparing the optimized FAA to the fixed uniform planar array, we find that the bendable FAA achieves a remarkable $156\%$ sum-rate improvement compared to the fixed planar array in the case of JFP with the directional pattern. Furthermore, the rotatable FAA exhibits notably superior performance in SFP and SJFP cases with omni-directional patterns, with respective $35\%$ and $281\%$.</description>

      <title>Extremely Large-Scale Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (XL-DMAs): Near-Field Modeling and Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel transceiver array architecture for extremely large-scale (XL) communications, offering the advantages of reduced power consumption and lower hardware costs compared to conventional arrays.
  This paper focuses on near-field channel estimation for XL-DMAs. We begin by analyzing the near-field characteristics of uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and introducing the Oblong Approx. model. This model decouples elevation-azimuth (EL-AZ) parameters for XL-DMAs, providing an effective means to characterize the near-field effect. It offers simpler mathematical expressions than the second-order Taylor expansion model, all while maintaining negligible model errors for oblong-shaped arrays.
  Building on the Oblong Approx. model, we propose an EL-AZ-decoupled estimation framework that involves near- and far-field parameter estimation for AZ/EL and EL/AZ directions, respectively. The former is formulated as a distributed compressive sensing problem, addressed using the proposed off-grid distributed orthogonal least squares algorithm, while the latter involves a straightforward parallelizable search. Crucially, we illustrate the viability of decoupled EL-AZ estimation for near-field UPAs, exhibiting commendable performance and linear complexity correlated with the number of metasurface elements.
  Moreover, we design an measurement matrix optimization method with the Lorentzian constraint on DMAs and highlight the estimation performance degradation resulting from this constraint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next sixth generation (6G) networks are envisioned to integrate sensing and communications in a single system, thus greatly improving spectrum utilization and reducing hardware costs. Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications combined with massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology holds significant promise in offering ubiquitous and seamless connectivity with high data rates. Existing integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) studies mainly focus on terrestrial systems, while operating ISAC in massive MIMO LEO satellite systems is promising to provide high-capacity communication and flexible sensing ubiquitously. In this paper, we first give an overview of LEO satellite systems and ISAC and consider adopting ISAC in the massive MIMO LEO satellite systems. Then, the recent research advances are presented. A discussion on related challenges and key enabling technologies follows. Finally, we point out some open issues and promising research directions.</description>

      <title>A Marginal Distributionally Robust Kalman Filter for Centralized Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State estimation is a fundamental problem for multi-sensor information fusion, essential in applications such as target tracking, power systems, and control automation. Previous research mostly ignores the correlation between sensors and assumes independent or known distributions. However, in practice, these distributions are often correlated and difAcult to estimate. This paper proposes a novel moment constrained marginal distributionally robust Kalman Alter (MC-MDRKF) for centralized state estimation in multi-sensor systems. First, we introduce a marginal distributional uncertainty set using a moment-constrained approach, which can better capture the uncertainties of Gaussian noises compared to Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based methods. Based on that, a minimax optimization problem is formulated to identify the least favorable joint distribution and the optimal MMSE estimator thereunder. It is proved that this problem can be reformulated as a convex optimization problem, allowing for efficient solution Anding. Subsequently, by accounting for marginal distributional uncertainty within the state space model, the proposed MC-MDRKF is devised in a minimax approach. Simulation result demonstrates the robustness and superiority of the proposed method in a multi-sensor target tracking scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executing flow estimation using Deep Learning (DL)-based soft sensors on resource-limited IoT devices has demonstrated promise in terms of reliability and energy efficiency. However, its application in the field of wastewater flow estimation remains underexplored due to: (1) a lack of available datasets, (2) inconvenient toolchains for on-device AI model development and deployment, and (3) hardware platforms designed for general DL purposes rather than being optimized for energy-efficient soft sensor applications. This study addresses these gaps by proposing an automated, end-to-end solution for wastewater flow estimation using a prototype IoT device.</description>

      <title>Phase-Only Beam Shaping for Transmitting Array Antennas in Radar Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two beam broadening methods for active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas with uniform amplitude excitation are proposed and compared: phase tapering optimization (PTO) and a novel time-varying phase tapering (TPT). The PTO is a simple and efficient approach assuming continuous polynomial phase distribution and requiring optimization of only few parameters. The TPT is valid mainly for radar applications, taking advantage of the fact that radars typically transmit pulse trains for coherent integration. By varying the array elements' phases from pulse to pulse, the TPT achieves effective amplitude tapering, thus providing a method of beam shaping, occasionally with a simple analytic form. The TPT also makes it possible to produce beam shaping with very low side lobe levels in comparison to the PTO. As a preliminary step, the dimensionality of the radiation pattern characterization for all scan directions is reduced from five to only two variables. This is crucial for efficient optimization of the radiation pattern which needs to be evaluated over a judiciously specified two-dimensional domain.</description>

      <title>Einstein from Noise: Statistical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ``Einstein from noise" (EfN) is a prominent example of the model bias phenomenon: systematic errors in the statistical model that lead to erroneous but consistent estimates. In the EfN experiment, one falsely believes that a set of observations contains noisy, shifted copies of a template signal (e.g., an Einstein image), whereas in reality, it contains only pure noise observations. To estimate the signal, the observations are first aligned with the template using cross-correlation, and then averaged. Although the observations contain nothing but noise, it was recognized early on that this process produces a signal that resembles the template signal! This pitfall was at the heart of a central scientific controversy about validation techniques in structural biology.
  This paper provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of the EfN phenomenon above. We show that the Fourier phases of the EfN estimator (namely, the average of the aligned noise observations) converge to the Fourier phases of the template signal, explaining the observed structural similarity. Additionally, we prove that the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the number of noise observations and, in the high-dimensional regime, to the Fourier magnitudes of the template signal. Moreover, in the high-dimensional regime, the Fourier magnitudes converge to a scaled version of the template signal's Fourier magnitudes. This work not only deepens the theoretical understanding of the EfN phenomenon but also highlights potential pitfalls in template matching techniques and emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of noisy observations across disciplines in engineering, statistics, physics, and biology.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates a fluid antenna (FA) enhanced integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system consisting of a base station (BS), multiple single-antenna communication users, and one point target, where the BS is equipped with FAs to enhance both the communication and sensing performance. First, we formulate a problem that maximizes the radar signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by jointly optimizing the FAs' positions and transmit beamforming matrix. Then, to tackle this highly non-convex problem, we present efficient algorithms by using alternating optimization (AO), successive convex approximation (SCA), and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Numerical results demonstrate the convergence behavior and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been successfully implemented across various signal processing fields, resulting in significant enhancements in performance. However, DNNs generally require substantial computational resources, leading to significant economic costs and posing challenges for their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we take advantage of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and quantization technologies to develop an energy-efficient and lightweight neuromorphic signal processing system. Our system is characterized by two principal innovations: a threshold-adaptive encoding (TAE) method and a quantized ternary SNN (QT-SNN). The TAE method can efficiently encode time-varying analog signals into sparse ternary spike trains, thereby reducing energy and memory demands for signal processing. QT-SNN, compatible with ternary spike trains from the TAE method, quantifies both membrane potentials and synaptic weights to reduce memory requirements while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on two typical signal-processing tasks: speech and electroencephalogram recognition. The results demonstrate that our neuromorphic signal processing system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with a 94% reduced memory requirement. Furthermore, through theoretical energy consumption analysis, our system shows 7.5x energy saving compared to other SNN works. The efficiency and efficacy of the proposed system highlight its potential as a promising avenue for energy-efficient signal processing.</description>

      <title>Topological Persistence Guided Knowledge Distillation for Wearable Sensor Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have achieved a lot of success in various applications involving converting wearable sensor data to actionable health insights. A common application areas is activity recognition, where deep-learning methods still suffer from limitations such as sensitivity to signal quality, sensor characteristic variations, and variability between subjects. To mitigate these issues, robust features obtained by topological data analysis (TDA) have been suggested as a potential solution. However, there are two significant obstacles to using topological features in deep learning: (1) large computational load to extract topological features using TDA, and (2) different signal representations obtained from deep learning and TDA which makes fusion difficult. In this paper, to enable integration of the strengths of topological methods in deep-learning for time-series data, we propose to use two teacher networks, one trained on the raw time-series data, and another trained on persistence images generated by TDA methods. The distilled student model utilizes only the raw time-series data at test-time. This approach addresses both issues. The use of KD with multiple teachers utilizes complementary information, and results in a compact model with strong supervisory features and an integrated richer representation. To assimilate desirable information from different modalities, we design new constraints, including orthogonality imposed on feature correlation maps for improving feature expressiveness and allowing the student to easily learn from the teacher. Also, we apply an annealing strategy in KD for fast saturation and better accommodation from different features, while the knowledge gap between the teachers and student is reduced. Finally, a robust student model is distilled, which uses only the time-series data as an input, while implicitly preserving topological features.</description>

      <title>Blind Bistatic Radar Parameter Estimation in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for blind bistatic radar parameter estimation (RPE), which enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by allowing passive (receive) base stations (BSs) to extract radar parameters (ranges and velocities of targets), without requiring knowledge of the information sent by an active (transmit) BS to its users. The contributed method is formulated with basis on the covariance of received signals, and under a generalized doubly-dispersive channel model compatible with most of the waveforms typically considered for ISAC, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). The original non-convex problem, which includes an $\ell_0$-norm regularization term in order to mitigate clutter, is solved not by relaxation to an $\ell_1$-norm, but by introducing an arbitrarily-tight approximation then relaxed via fractional programming (FP). Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of an ideal system with perfect knowledge of the transmit signal covariance with an increasing number of transmit frames.</description>

      <title>Interference Management in MIMO-ISAC Systems: A Transceiver Design Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under multi-input multi-output (MIMO) architecture achieves dual functionalities of sensing and communication on the same platform by utilizing spatial gain, which provides a feasible paradigm facing spectrum congestion. However, the dual functionalities of sensing and communication operating simultaneously in the same platform bring severe interference in the ISAC systems. Facing this challenge, we propose a joint optimization framework for transmit beamforming and receive filter design for ISAC systems with MIMO architecture. We aim to maximize the signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) at the receiver while considering various constraints such as waveform similarity, power budget, and communication performance requirements to ensure the integration of the dual functionalities. In particular, the overall transmit beamforming is refined into sensing beamforming and communication beamforming, and a quadratic transformation (QT) is introduced to relax and convert the complex non-convex optimization objective. An efficient algorithm based on covariance matrix tapers (CMT) is proposed to restructure the clutter covariance matrix considering the mismatched steering vector, thereby improving the robustness of the ISAC transceiver design. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Wildfire Tracking with UAV Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suitably equipped with cameras and sensors, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be instrumental for wildfire prediction, tracking, and monitoring, provided that uninterrupted connectivity can be guaranteed even if some of the ground access points (APs) are damaged by the fire itself. A cell-free network structure, with UAVs connecting to a multiplicity of APs, is therefore ideal in terms of resilience. This work proposes a trajectory optimization framework for a UAV swarm tracking a wildfire while maintaining cell-free connectivity with ground APs. Such optimization entails a constant repositioning of the multiplicity of UAVs as the fire evolves to ensure that the best possible view is acquired and transmitted reliably, while respecting altitude limits, avoiding collisions, and proceeding to recharge batteries as needed. Given the complexity and time-varying nature of this multi-UAV trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning is leveraged, specifically the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The approach is shown to be highly effective for wildfire tracking and coverage and could be likewise applicable to survey other natural and man-made phenomena, including weather events, earthquakes, or chemical spills.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Time Frequency Space with Delay-Doppler Alignment Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay-Doppler alignment modulation (DDAM) is a novel technique to mitigate time-frequency doubly selective channels by leveraging the high spatial resolution offered by large antenna arrays and multi-path sparsity of millimeter wave (mmWave) and TeraHertz (THz) channels. By introducing per-path delay and Doppler compensations, followed by path-based beamforming, it is possible to reshape the channel features with significantly reduced channel delay and Doppler spreads. This offers new degrees-of-freedom for waveform designs such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), since the reshaped channel can significantly relax the constraints on OTFS parameter selection and reduce the complexity of signal detection at the receiver. Therefore, in this paper, by combing DDAM with OTFS, we propose a novel technique termed DDAM-OTFS. Two implementation schemes are introduced for DDAM-OTFS, namely path-based alignment and bin-based alignment. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DDAM-OTFS in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) compared to the conventional OTFS.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Secret and Covert Communications for Multi-User Multi-Antenna Uplink UAV Systems: Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically. In summary, our study fills the gaps in joint secret and covert transmission for multi-user multi-antenna uplink UAV communications and provides insights to construct such systems.</description>

      <title>LDGCN: An Edge-End Lightweight Dual GCN Based on Single-Channel EEG for Driver Drowsiness Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver drowsiness electroencephalography (EEG) signal monitoring can timely alert drivers of their drowsiness status, thereby reducing the probability of traffic accidents. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown significant advancements in processing the non-stationary, time-varying, and non-Euclidean nature of EEG signals. However, the existing single-channel EEG adjacency graph construction process lacks interpretability, which hinders the ability of GCNs to effectively extract adjacency graph features, thus affecting the performance of drowsiness monitoring. To address this issue, we propose an edge-end lightweight dual graph convolutional network (LDGCN). Specifically, we are the first to incorporate neurophysiological knowledge to design a Baseline Drowsiness Status Adjacency Graph (BDSAG), which characterizes driver drowsiness status. Additionally, to express more features within limited EEG data, we introduce the Augmented Graph-level Module (AGM). This module captures global and local information at the graph level, ensuring that BDSAG features remain intact while enhancing effective feature expression capability. Furthermore, to deploy our method on the fourth-generation Raspberry Pi, we utilize Adaptive Pruning Optimization (APO) on both channels and neurons, reducing inference latency by almost half. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LDGCN offers the best trade-off between monitoring performance and hardware resource utilization compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

      <description>arXiv:2407.05791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study the energy efficiency maximization problem for a fluid antenna system (FAS) in near field communications. Specifically, we consider a point-to-point near-field system where the base station (BS) transmitter has multiple fixed-position antennas and the user receives the signals with multiple fluid antennas. Our objective is to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming of the BS and the fluid antenna positions at the user for maximizing the energy efficiency. Our scheme is based on an alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively solves the beamforming and antenna position subproblems. Our simulation results validate the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm and confirm the effectiveness of FAS.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity-Constrained Spectral Efficiency Analysis for 6G Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a tutorial on how to account for the computational time complexity overhead of signal processing in the spectral efficiency (SE) analysis of wireless waveforms. Our methodology is particularly relevant in scenarios where achieving higher SE entails a penalty in complexity, a common trade-off present in 6G candidate waveforms. We consider that SE derives from the data rate, which is impacted by time-dependent overheads. Thus, neglecting the computational complexity overhead in the SE analysis grants an unfair advantage to more computationally complex waveforms, as they require larger computational resources to meet a signal processing runtime below the symbol period. We demonstrate our points with two case studies. In the first, we refer to IEEE 802.11a-compliant baseband processors from the literature to show that their runtime significantly impacts the SE perceived by upper layers. In the second case study, we show that waveforms considered less efficient in terms of SE can outperform their more computationally expensive counterparts if provided with equivalent high-performance computational resources. Based on these cases, we believe our tutorial can address the comparative SE analysis of waveforms that operate under different computational resource constraints.</description>

      <title>Receiver Selection and Transmit Beamforming for Multi-static Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are expected to develop a novel paradigm of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to enable both the high-accuracy sensing and high-speed communications. However, conventional mono-static ISAC systems, which simultaneously transmit and receive at the same equipment, may suffer from severe self-interference, and thus significantly degrade the system performance.To address this issue, this paper studies a multi-static ISAC system for cooperative target localization and communications, where the transmitter transmits ISAC signal to multiple receivers (REs) deployed at different positions. We derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) on the joint estimations of both the transmission delay and Doppler shift for cooperative target localization, and the CRB minimization problem is formulated by considering the cooperative cost and communication rate requirements for the REs. To solve this problem, we first decouple it into two subproblems for RE selection and transmit beamforming, respectively. Then, a minimax linkage-based method is proposed to solve the RE selection subproblem, and a successive convex approximation algorithm is adopted to deal with the transmit beamforming subproblem with non-convex constraints. Finally, numerical results validate our analysis and reveal that our proposed multi-static ISAC scheme achieves better ISAC performance than the conventional mono-static ones when the number of cooperative REs is large.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based CSI Feedback in Wi-Fi Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Wi-Fi systems, channel state information (CSI) plays a crucial role in enabling access points to execute beamforming operations. However, the feedback overhead associated with CSI significantly hampers the throughput improvements. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have transformed the approach to CSI feedback in cellular systems. Drawing inspiration from the successes witnessed in the realm of mobile communications, this paper introduces a DL-based CSI feedback framework, named EFNet, tailored for Wi-Fi systems. The proposed framework leverages an autoencoder to achieve precise feedback with minimal overhead. The process involves the station utilizing the encoder to compress and quantize a series of matrices into codeword bit streams, which are then fed back to the access point. Subsequently, the decoder installed at the AP reconstructs beamforming matrices from these bit streams. We implement the EFNet system using standard Wi-Fi equipment operating in the 2.4 GHz band. Experimental findings in an office environment reveal a remarkable 80.77% reduction in feedback overhead compared to the 802.11ac standard, alongside a significant boost in net throughput of up to 30.72%.</description>

      <title>CA-FedRC: Codebook Adaptation via Federated Reservoir Computing in 5G NR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the burgeon deployment of the fifth-generation new radio (5G NR) networks, the codebook plays a crucial role in enabling the base station (BS) to acquire the channel state information (CSI). Different 5G NR codebooks incur varying overheads and exhibit performance disparities under diverse channel conditions, necessitating codebook adaptation based on channel conditions to reduce feedback overhead while enhancing performance. However, existing methods of 5G NR codebooks adaptation require significant overhead for model training and feedback or fall short in performance. To address these limitations, this letter introduces a federated reservoir computing framework designed for efficient codebook adaptation in computationally and feedback resource-constrained mobile devices. This framework utilizes a novel series of indicators as input training data, striking an effective balance between performance and feedback overhead. Compared to conventional models, the proposed codebook adaptation via federated reservoir computing (CA-FedRC), achieves rapid convergence and significant loss reduction in both speed and accuracy. Extensive simulations under various channel conditions demonstrate that our algorithm not only reduces resource consumption of users but also accurately identifies channel types, thereby optimizing the trade-off between spectrum efficiency, computational complexity, and feedback overhead.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal MIMO Detection Using Gradient-Based MCMC in Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete nature of transmitted symbols poses challenges for achieving optimal detection in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems associated with a large number of antennas. Recently, the combination of two powerful machine learning methods, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and gradient descent, has emerged as a highly efficient solution to address this issue. However, existing gradient-based MCMC detectors are heuristically designed and thus are theoretically untenable. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel sampling algorithm tailored for discrete spaces. This algorithm leverages gradients from the underlying continuous spaces for acceleration while maintaining the validity of probabilistic sampling. We prove the convergence of this method and also analyze its convergence rate using both MCMC theory and empirical diagnostics. On this basis, we develop a MIMO detector that precisely samples from the target discrete distribution and generates posterior Bayesian estimates using these samples, whose performance is thereby theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, our proposed detector is highly parallelizable and scalable to large MIMO dimensions, positioning it as a compelling candidate for next-generation wireless networks. Simulation results show that our detector achieves near-optimal performance, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and showcases resilience to various system setups.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current satellite payload architectures, which are predominantly hardware-driven and lack the flexibility to adapt to increasing data demands and uneven traffic. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel architecture for future regenerative and programmable satellite payloads and utilize interconnected modem banks to promote higher scalability and flexibility. We formulate an optimization problem to efficiently manage traffic among these modem banks and balance the load. Additionally, we provide comparative numerical simulation results, considering end-to-end delay and packet loss analysis. The results illustrate that our proposed architecture maintains lower delays and packet loss even with higher traffic demands and smaller buffer sizes.</description>

      <title>Earable and Wrist-worn Setup for Accurate Step Counting Utilizing Body-Area Electrostatic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Step-counting has been widely implemented in wrist-worn devices and is accepted by end users as a quantitative indicator of everyday exercise. However, existing counting approach (mostly on wrist-worn setup) lacks robustness and thus introduces inaccuracy issues in certain scenarios like brief intermittent walking bouts and random arm motions or static arm status while walking (no clear correlation of motion pattern between arm and leg). This paper proposes a low-power step-counting solution utilizing the body area electric field acquired by a novel electrostatic sensing unit, consuming only 87.3 $\mu$W of power, hoping to strengthen the robustness of current dominant solution. We designed two wearable devices for on-the-wrist and in-the-ear deployment and collected body-area electric field-derived motion signals from ten volunteers. Four walking scenarios are considered: in the parking lot/shopping center with/without pushing the shopping trolley. The step-counting accuracy from the prototypes shows better accuracy than the commercial wrist-worn devices (e.g.,96% of the wrist- and ear-worn prototype vs. 66% of the Fitbit when walking in the shopping center while pushing a shopping trolley). We finally discussed the potential and limitations of sensing body-area electric fields for wrist-worn and ear-worn step-counting and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) is a widely used Direction of Arrival (DoA)/Angle of Arrival (AoA) estimation algorithm applied to various application domains such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and astronomy. However, MUSIC is computationally expensive and challenging to implement in low-power hardware, requiring exploration of trade-offs between accuracy, cost, and power. We present MUSIC-lite, which exploits approximate computing to generate a design space exploring accuracy-area-power trade-offs. This is specifically applied to the computationally intensive singular value decomposition (SVD) component of the MUSIC algorithm in an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) radar use case. MUSIC-lite incorporates approximate adders into the iterative CORDIC algorithm that is used for hardware implementation of MUSIC, generating interesting accuracy-area-power trade-offs. Our experiments demonstrate MUSIC-lite's ability to save an average of 17.25% on-chip area and 19.4% power with a minimal 0.14% error for efficient MUSIC implementations.</description>

      <title>Listen-While-Talking: Toward dApp-based Real-Time Spectrum Sharing in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This demo paper presents a dApp-based real-time spectrum sharing scenario where a 5th generation (5G) base station implementing the NR stack adapts its transmission and reception strategies based on the incumbent priority users in the Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band. The dApp is responsible for obtaining relevant measurements from the Next Generation Node Base (gNB), running the spectrum sensing inference, and configuring the gNB with a control action upon detecting the primary incumbent user transmissions. This approach is built on dApps, which extend the O-RAN framework to the real-time and user plane domains. Thus, it avoids the need of dedicated Spectrum Access Systems (SASs) in the CBRS band. The demonstration setup is based on the open-source 5G OpenAirInterface (OAI) framework, where we have implemented a dApp interfaced with a gNB and communicating with a Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) User Equipment (UE) in an over-the-air wireless environment. When an incumbent user has active transmission, the dApp will detect and inform the primary user presence to the gNB. The dApps will also enforce a control policy that adapts the scheduling and transmission policy of the Radio Access Network (RAN). This demo provides valuable insights into the potential of using dApp-based spectrum sensing with O-RAN architecture in next generation cellular networks.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi Beyond Communications: Experimental Evaluation of Respiration Monitoring and Motion Detection Using COTS Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing has become an attractive option for non-invasive monitoring of human activities and vital signs. This paper explores the feasibility of using state-of-the-art commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices for Wi-Fi sensing applications, particularly respiration monitoring and motion detection. We utilize the Intel AX210 network interface card (NIC) to transmit Wi-Fi signals in both 2.4 GHz and 6 GHz frequency bands. Our experiments rely on channel frequency response (CFR) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) data, which are processed using a moving average algorithm to extract human behavior patterns. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing and representing human respiration and motion patterns. Furthermore, we compare the performance of Wi-Fi sensing across different frequency bands, highlighting the advantages of using higher frequencies for improved sensitivity and clarity. Our findings showcase the practicality of using COTS devices for Wi-Fi sensing and lay the groundwork for the development of non-invasive, contactless sensing systems. These systems have potential applications in various fields, including healthcare, smart homes, and Metaverse.</description>

      <title>RIS-assisted Coverage Enhancement in mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology to facilitate high-rate communications and super-resolution sensing, particularly operating in the millimeter wave (mmWave) band. However, the vulnerability of mmWave signals to blockages severely impairs ISAC capabilities and coverage. To tackle this, an efficient and low-cost solution is to deploy distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to construct virtual links between the base stations (BSs) and users in a controllable fashion. In this paper, we investigate the generalized RIS-assisted mmWave ISAC networks considering the blockage effect, and examine the beneficial impact of RISs on the coverage rate utilizing stochastic geometry. Specifically, taking into account the coupling effect of ISAC dual functions within the same network topology, we derive the conditional coverage probability of ISAC performance for two association cases, based on the proposed beam pattern model and user association policies. Then, the marginal coverage rate is calculated by combining these two cases through the distance-dependent thinning method. Simulation results verify the accuracy of derived theoretical formulations and provide valuable guidelines for the practical network deployment. Specifically, our results indicate the superiority of the RIS deployment with the density of 40 km${}^{-2}$ BSs, and that the joint coverage rate of ISAC performance exhibits potential growth from $67.1\%$ to $92.2\%$ with the deployment of RISs.</description>

      <title>DM-MIMO: Diffusion Models for Robust Semantic Communications over MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates robust semantic communications over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels. Current semantic communications over MIMO channels mainly focus on channel adaptive encoding and decoding, which lacks exploration of signal distribution. To leverage the potential of signal distribution in signal space denoising, we develop a diffusion model over MIMO channels (DM-MIMO), a plugin module at the receiver side in conjunction with singular value decomposition (SVD) based precoding and equalization. Specifically, due to the significant variations in effective noise power over distinct sub-channels, we determine the effective sampling steps accordingly and devise a joint sampling algorithm. Utilizing a three-stage training algorithm, DM-MIMO learns the distribution of the encoded signal, which enables noise elimination over all sub-channels. Experimental results demonstrate that the DM-MIMO effectively reduces the mean square errors (MSE) of the equalized signal and the DM-MIMO semantic communication system (DM-MIMO-JSCC) outperforms the JSCC-based semantic communication system in image reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Agtrup (BlueKolding) dataset, collected from Denmark's Agtrup wastewater treatment plant, specifically designed to enhance phosphorus removal via chemical and biological methods. This rich dataset is assembled through a high-frequency Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system data collection process, which captures a wide range of variables related to the operational dynamics of nutrient removal. It comprises time-series data featuring measurements sampled to a frequency of two minutes across various control, process, and environmental variables. The comprehensive dataset aims to foster significant advancements in wastewater management by supporting the development of sophisticated predictive models and optimizing operational strategies. By providing detailed insights into the interactions and efficiencies of chemical and biological phosphorus removal processes, the dataset serves as a vital resource for environmental researchers and engineers focused on improving the sustainability and effectiveness of wastewater treatment operations. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to facilitate the creation of digital twins and the application of machine learning techniques, such as deep reinforcement learning, to predict and enhance system performance under varying operational conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-level Reliability Interface for Semantic Communications over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication, when examined through the lens of joint source-channel coding (JSCC), maps source messages directly into channel input symbols, where the measure of success is defined by end-to-end distortion rather than traditional metrics such as block error rate. Previous studies have shown significant improvements achieved through deep learning (DL)-driven JSCC compared to traditional separate source and channel coding. However, JSCC is impractical in existing communication networks, where application and network providers are typically different entities connected over general-purpose TCP/IP links. In this paper, we propose designing the source and channel mappings separately and sequentially via a novel multi-level reliability interface. This conceptual interface enables semi-JSCC at both the learned source and channel mappers and achieves many of the gains observed in existing DL-based JSCC work (which would require a fully joint design between the application and the network), such as lower end-to-end distortion and graceful degradation of distortion with channel quality. We believe this work represents an important step towards realizing semantic communications in wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While significant advancements have been made in music generation and differentiable sound synthesis within machine learning and computer audition, the simulation of instrument vibration guided by physical laws has been underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for simulating the spatio-temporal motion of nonlinear strings, integrating modal synthesis and spectral modeling within a neural network framework. Our model leverages physical properties and fundamental frequencies as inputs, outputting string states across time and space that solve the partial differential equation characterizing the nonlinear string. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves superior accuracy in string motion simulation compared to existing baseline architectures. The code and demo are available online.</description>

      <title>Cost-Efficient Computation Offloading in SAGIN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning and Perception-Aided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Space-Air-Ground Integrated Network (SAGIN), crucial to the advancement of sixth-generation (6G) technology, plays a key role in ensuring universal connectivity, particularly by addressing the communication needs of remote areas lacking cellular network infrastructure. This paper delves into the role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) within SAGIN, where they act as a control layer owing to their adaptable deployment capabilities and their intermediary role. Equipped with millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar and vision sensors, these UAVs are capable of acquiring multi-source data, which helps to diminish uncertainty and enhance the accuracy of decision-making. Concurrently, UAVs collect tasks requiring computing resources from their coverage areas, originating from a variety of mobile devices moving at different speeds. These tasks are then allocated to ground base stations (BSs), low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite, and local processing units to improve processing efficiency. Amidst this framework, our study concentrates on devising dynamic strategies for facilitating task hosting between mobile devices and UAVs, offloading computations, managing associations between UAVs and BSs, and allocating computing resources. The objective is to minimize the time-averaged network cost, considering the uncertainty of device locations, speeds, and even types. To tackle these complexities, we propose a deep reinforcement learning and perception-aided online approach (DRL-and-Perception-aided Approach) for this joint optimization in SAGIN, tailored for an environment filled with uncertainties. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations, which quantify its performance relative to various network parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial 6G networks will likely operate in the upper mid-band (7-24 GHz), which has decent propagation conditions but underwhelming new spectrum availability. In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the ambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology from being massive to gigantic. We describe how many antennas are needed and can realistically be deployed, and what the peak user rate and degrees-of-freedom (DOF) can become. We further suggest a new deployment strategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these bands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base station site. We also identify five open research challenges that must be overcome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost, and algorithmic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Spatial Non-Stationary Dual-Wideband Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input and multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems, considering the spherical wavefront effect, spatially non-stationary (SnS) property, and dual-wideband effects. To accurately characterize the XL-MIMO channel, we first derive a novel spatial-and-frequency-domain channel model for XL-MIMO systems and carefully examine the channel characteristics in the angular-and-delay domain. Based on the obtained channel representation, we formulate XL-MIMO channel estimation as a Bayesian inference problem. To fully exploit the clustered sparsity of angular-and-delay channels and capture the inter-antenna and inter-subcarrier correlations, a Markov random field (MRF)-based hierarchical prior model is adopted. Meanwhile, to facilitate efficient channel reconstruction, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm based on approximate message passing (AMP) with a unitary transformation. Tailored to the MRF-based hierarchical prior model, the message passing equations are reformulated using structured variational inference, belief propagation, and mean-field rules. Finally, simulation results validate the convergence and superiority of the proposed algorithm over existing methods.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Nonlinear Kalman Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) is a state estimation algorithm that optimally combines system knowledge and measurements to minimize the mean squared error of the estimated states. While KF was initially designed for linear systems, numerous extensions of it, such as extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), cubature Kalman filter (CKF), etc., have been proposed for nonlinear systems. Although different types of nonlinear KFs have different pros and cons, they all use the same framework of linear KF, which, according to what we found in this paper, tends to give overconfident and less accurate state estimations when the measurement functions are nonlinear. Therefore, in this study, we designed a new framework for nonlinear KFs and showed theoretically and empirically that the new framework estimates the states and covariance matrix more accurately than the old one. The new framework was tested on four different nonlinear KFs and five different tasks, showcasing its ability to reduce the estimation errors by several orders of magnitude in low-measurement-noise conditions, with only about a 10 to 90% increase in computational time. All types of nonlinear KFs can benefit from the new framework, and the benefit will increase as the sensors become more and more accurate in the future. As an example, EKF, the simplest nonlinear KF that was previously believed to work poorly for strongly nonlinear systems, can now provide fast and fairly accurate state estimations with the help of the new framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/Shida-Jiang/A-new-framework-for-nonlinear-Kalman-filters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the problem of joint power control and beamforming design to maximize the weighted sum rate in large and potentially cell-free massive MIMO networks. In contrast to the available short-term methods, where an iterative algorithm is run for every instantaneous channel realization, we derive an iterative algorithm that can be run only sporadically leveraging known channel statistics, with minor performance loss. In addition, our algorithm also applies to the design of non-trivial cooperative beamforming schemes subject to limited sharing of instantaneous channel state information. Furthermore, our algorithm generalizes and outperforms the competing long-term methods from the massive MIMO literature, which are restricted to long-term power control only or to long-term joint power control and large-scale fading decoding design.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present stripmap mode spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging with the focus on Doppler centroid estimation. The Doppler centroid is the result of non-zero squint angle which if it is not compensated it can de-focus the image. We present an efficient method based on image entropy to estimate the fractional part of the Doppler centroid. We further address the speckle noise removal process which high resolution SAR images suffer from and degrade the quality of the reconstructed images considerably.
  Finally, we utilize experimental data gathered from RADARSAT-1 satellite from Vancouver, Canada to verify the accuracy of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>A Dual-Function Radar-Communication System Empowered by Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03286v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the use of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems to improve communication capacity and sensing precision, and enhance coverage for both functions. In contrast to most of the existing RIS aided DFRC works where the RIS is modeled as a diagonal phase shift matrix and can only reflect signals to half space, we propose a novel beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) aided DFRC system. Specifically, the proposed BD-RIS supports the hybrid reflecting and transmitting mode, and is compatible with flexible architectures, enabling the system to realize full-space coverage and to achieve enhanced performance. To achieve the expected benefits, we jointly optimize the transmit waveform, the BD-RIS matrices, and sensing receive filters, by maximizing the minimum signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio for fair target detection, subject to the constraints of the communication quality of service, different BD-RIS architectures and power budget. To solve the non-convex and non-smooth max-min problem, a general solution based on the alternating direction method of multipliers is provided. Numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and show the superiority of the BD-RIS aided DFRC system in terms of both communication and sensing compared to conventional RIS aided DFRC.</description>

      <title>LEO- and RIS-Empowered User Tracking: A Riemannian Manifold Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently drawn significant attention as two transformative technologies, and the synergy between them emerges as a promising paradigm for providing cross-environment communication and positioning services. This paper investigates an integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless network that leverages LEO satellites and RISs to achieve simultaneous tracking of the 3D position, 3D velocity, and 3D orientation of user equipment (UE). To address inherent challenges including nonlinear observation function, constrained UE state, and unknown observation statistics, we develop a Riemannian manifold-based unscented Kalman filter (UKF) method. This method propagates statistics over nonlinear functions using generated sigma points and maintains state constraints through projection onto the defined manifold space. Additionally, by employing Fisher information matrices (FIMs) of the sigma points, a belief assignment principle is proposed to approximate the unknown observation covariance matrix, thereby ensuring accurate measurement updates in the UKF procedure. Numerical results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in tracking accuracy facilitated by RIS integration, despite urban signal reception challenges from LEO satellites. In addition, extensive simulations underscore the superior performance of the proposed tracking method and FIM-based belief assignment over the adopted benchmarks. Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed UKF is verified across various uncertainty levels.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel waveform design approach named COSMIC (Connectivity-Oriented Sensing Method for Imaging and Communication). The generation of radio images of the environment is enabled by imposing an extended orthogonality condition among waveforms. In contrast to traditional time, frequency, or space multiplexing systems, COSMIC achieves orthogonality through algebraic precoding of the transmitted waveforms from all antennas. Furthermore, by leveraging the degrees of freedom inherent in the assumption that the imaging field of view is significantly smaller than the length of the transmitted signals, the resulting waveforms are designed to convey communication symbols without impeding the sensing operations. We analytically demonstrate that the efficiency of imaging and communication sub-systems can be tuned according to the specific use case requirements. Simulation results indicate that COSMIC waveforms facilitate accurate environmental imaging while preserving near-optimal communication performance in terms of error rate and capacity.</description>

      <title>Fast-Fading Channel and Power Optimization of the Magnetic Inductive Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cellular network of magnetic Induction (MI) communication holds promise in long-distance underground environments. In the traditional MI communication, there is no fast-fading channel since the MI channel is treated as a quasi-static channel. However, for the vehicle (mobile) MI (VMI) communication, the unpredictable antenna vibration brings the remarkable fast-fading. As such fast-fading cannot be modeled by the central limit theorem, it differs radically from other wireless fast-fading channels. Unfortunately, few studies focus on this phenomenon. In this paper, using a novel space modeling based on the electromagnetic field theorem, we propose a 3-dimension model of the VMI antenna vibration. By proposing ``conjugate pseudo-piecewise functions'' and boundary $p(x)$ distribution, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF) and the expectation of the VMI fast-fading channel. We also theoretically analyze the effects of the VMI fast-fading on the network throughput, including the VMI outage probability which can be ignored in the traditional MI channel study. We draw several intriguing conclusions different from those in wireless fast-fading studies. For instance, the fast-fading brings more uniformly distributed channel coefficients. Finally, we propose the power control algorithm using the non-cooperative game and multiagent Q-learning methods to optimize the throughput of the cellular VMI network. Simulations validate the derivation and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Learning graph geometry and topology using dynamical systems based message-passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09924v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce DYMAG: a message passing paradigm for GNNs built on the expressive power of continuous, multiscale graph-dynamics. Standard discrete-time message passing algorithms implicitly make use of simplistic graph dynamics and aggregation schemes which limit their ability to capture fundamental graph topological properties. By contrast, DYMAG makes use of complex graph dynamics based on the heat and wave equation as well as a more complex equation which admits chaotic solutions. The continuous nature of the dynamics are leveraged to generate multiscale (dynamic-time snapshot) representations which we prove are linked to various graph topological and spectral properties. We demonstrate experimentally that DYMAG achieves superior performance in recovering the generating parameters of Erd\"os-Renyi and stochastic block model random graphs and the persistent homology of synthetic graphs and citation network. Since the behavior of proteins and biomolecules is sensitive to graph topology and exhibits important structure at multiple scales, we find that DYMAG outperforms other methods at predicting salient features of various biomolecules.</description>

Abstract: While the pace of commercial scale application of Wi-Fi 6 accelerates, the IEEE 802.11 Working Group is about to complete the development of a new amendment standard IEEE 802.11be -- Extremely High Throughput (EHT), also known as Wi-Fi 7, which can be used to meet the demand for the throughput of 4K/8K videos up to tens of Gbps and low-latency video applications such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Wi-Fi 7 not only scales Wi-Fi 6 with doubled bandwidth, but also supports real-time applications, which brings revolutionary changes to Wi-Fi. In this article, we start by introducing the main objectives and timeline of Wi-Fi 7 and then list the latest key techniques which promote the performance improvement of Wi-Fi 7. Finally, we validate the most critical objectives of Wi-Fi 7 -- the potential up to 30 Gbps throughput and lower latency. System-level simulation results suggest that by combining the new techniques, Wi-Fi 7 achieves 30 Gbps throughput and lower latency than Wi-Fi 6.</description>

Abstract: With the increasing demands in communication, Wi-Fi technology is advancing towards its next generation. As high-need applications like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) emerge, the role of millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology becomes critical. This paper explores Wi-Fi 8's potential features, especially its integration of mmWave technology. We address the challenges of implementing mmWave under current protocols and examine the compatibility of new features with mmWave. Our study includes system-level simulations, upclocking the 802.11ac PPDU to 60 GHz, and considers hardware limitations. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements with mmWave in Wi-Fi 8, indicating its feasibility for high-demand wireless scenarios.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Channel Estimation for Extremely Large MIMO THz Communication Systems Under Dual-Wideband Fading Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of extremely large (XL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation in the terahertz (THz) frequency band, considering the presence of propagation delays across the entire array apertures at both communication ends, which naturally leads to frequency selectivity. This problem is known as beam squint and may be pronounced when communications are subject to multipath fading conditions. Multi-carrier (MC) transmission schemes, which are usually deployed in THz communication systems to address these issues, suffer from high peak-to-average power ratio, which is specifically dominant in this frequency band where low transmit power is mostly feasible. Furthermore, the frequency selectivity caused by severe molecular absorption in the THz band necessitates delicate consideration in MC system design. Motivated by the benefits of single-carrier (SC) waveforms for practical THz communication systems, diverging from the current dominant research trend on MC systems, we devise a novel channel estimation problem formulation in the time domain for SC XL MIMO systems subject to multipath signal propagation, spatial wideband effects, and molecular absorption. An efficient alternating minimization approach is presented to solve the proposed mixed-integer sparse problem formulation. The conducted extensive performance evaluation results validate that the proposed XL MIMO estimation scheme exhibits superior performance than conventional SC- and MC-based techniques, approaching the idealized lower bound.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for mmWave MIMO using sub-6 GHz Out-of-Band Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems will employ sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands working cooperatively. Establishing a MIMO communication link usually relies on estimating channel state information (CSI) which is difficult to acquire at mmWave frequencies due to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose three novel methods to estimate mmWave MIMO channels using out-of-band information obtained from the sub-6GHz band. We compare the proposed channel estimation methods with a conventional one utilizing only in-band information. Simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the conventional mmWave channel estimation method in terms of achievable spectral efficiency, especially at low SNR and high K-factor.</description>

      <title>Two-timescale joint power control and beamforming design with applications to cell-free massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02080v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study we derive novel optimal algorithms for joint power control and beamforming design in modern large-scale MIMO systems, such as those based on the cell-free massive MIMO and XL-MIMO concepts. In particular, motivated by the need for scalable system architectures, we formulate and solve nontrivial two-timescale extensions of the classical uplink power minimization and max-min fair resource allocation problems. In our formulations, we let the beamformers be functions mapping partial instantaneous channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights, and jointly optimize these functions and the power control coefficients based on long-term statistical CSI. This long-term approach mitigates the severe scalability issues of competing short-term iterative algorithms in the literature, where a central controller endowed with global instantaneous CSI must solve a complex optimization problem for every channel realization, hence imposing very demanding requirements in terms of computational complexity and signaling overhead. Moreover, our approach outperforms the available long-term approaches, which do not jointly optimize powers and beamformers. The obtained optimal long-term algorithms are then illustrated and compared against existing short-term and long-term algorithms via numerical simulations in a cell-free massive MIMO setup with different levels of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Synthetic training set generation using text-to-audio models for environmental sound classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-audio models have revolutionized the field of automatic audio generation. This paper investigates their application in generating synthetic datasets for training data-driven models. Specifically, this study analyzes the performance of two environmental sound classification systems trained with data generated from text-to-audio models. We considered three scenarios: a) augmenting the training dataset with data generated by text-to-audio models; b) using a mixed training dataset combining real and synthetic text-driven generated data; and c) using a training dataset composed entirely of synthetic audio. In all cases, the performance of the classification models was tested on real data. Results indicate that text-to-audio models are effective for dataset augmentation, with consistent performance when replacing a subset of the recorded dataset. However, the performance of the audio recognition models drops when relying entirely on generated audio.</description>

      <title>CaFNet: A Confidence-Driven Framework for Radar Camera Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth estimation is critical in autonomous driving for interpreting 3D scenes accurately. Recently, radar-camera depth estimation has become of sufficient interest due to the robustness and low-cost properties of radar. Thus, this paper introduces a two-stage, end-to-end trainable Confidence-aware Fusion Net (CaFNet) for dense depth estimation, combining RGB imagery with sparse and noisy radar point cloud data. The first stage addresses radar-specific challenges, such as ambiguous elevation and noisy measurements, by predicting a radar confidence map and a preliminary coarse depth map. A novel approach is presented for generating the ground truth for the confidence map, which involves associating each radar point with its corresponding object to identify potential projection surfaces. These maps, together with the initial radar input, are processed by a second encoder. For the final depth estimation, we innovate a confidence-aware gated fusion mechanism to integrate radar and image features effectively, thereby enhancing the reliability of the depth map by filtering out radar noise. Our methodology, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates superior performance, improving upon the current leading model by 3.2% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 2.7% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

      <title>MVGT: A Multi-view Graph Transformer Based on Spatial Relations for EEG Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG), a medical imaging technique that captures scalp electrical activity of brain structures via electrodes, has been widely used in affective computing. The spatial domain of EEG is rich in affective information. However, few of the existing studies have simultaneously analyzed EEG signals from multiple perspectives of geometric and anatomical structures in spatial domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-view Graph Transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations, which integrates information from the temporal, frequency and spatial domains, including geometric and anatomical structures, so as to enhance the expressive power of the model comprehensively. We incorporate the spatial information of EEG channels into the model as encoding, thereby improving its ability to perceive the spatial structure of the channels. Meanwhile, experimental results based on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recent years. In addition, the results also show that the MVGT could extract information from multiple domains and capture inter-channel relationships in EEG emotion recognition tasks effectively.</description>

      <title>Decoding Analog Subspace Codes: Algorithms for Character-Polynomial Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose efficient minimum-distance decoding and list-decoding algorithms for a certain class of analog subspace codes, referred to as character-polynomial (CP) codes, recently introduced by Soleymani and the second author. In particular, a CP code without its character can be viewed as a subcode of a Reed-Solomon (RS) code, where a certain subset of the coefficients of the message polynomial is set to zeros. We then demonstrate how classical decoding methods, including list decoders, for RS codes can be leveraged for decoding CP codes. For instance, it is shown that, in almost all cases, the list decoder behaves as a unique decoder. We also present a probabilistic analysis of the improvements in list decoding of CP codes when leveraging their certain structure as subcodes of RS codes.</description>
