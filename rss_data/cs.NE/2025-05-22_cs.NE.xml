      <title>Beyond Pairwise Plasticity: Group-Level Spike Synchrony Facilitates Efficient Learning in Spiking Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain networks rely on precise spike timing and coordinated activity to support robust and energy-efficient learning. Inspired by these principles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for low-power, event-driven computing. However, most biologically-inspired learning rules employed in SNNs, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), rely on isolated spike pairs and lack sensitivity to population-level activity. This limits their stability and generalization, particularly in noisy and fast-changing environments. Motivated by biological observations that neural synchrony plays a central role in learning and memory, we introduce a spike-synchrony-dependent plasticity (SSDP) rule that adjusts synaptic weights based on the degree of coordinated firing among neurons. SSDP supports stable and scalable learning by encouraging neurons to form coherent activity patterns. One prominent outcome is a sudden transition from unstable to stable dynamics during training, suggesting that synchrony may drive convergence toward equilibrium firing regimes. We demonstrate SSDP's effectiveness across multiple network types, from minimal-layer models to spiking ResNets and SNN-Transformer. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a synaptic plasticity mechanism in a spiking transformer. SSDP operates in a fully event-driven manner and incurs minimal computational cost, making it well-suited for neuromorphic deployment. In this approach, local synaptic modifications are associated with the collective dynamics of neural networks, resulting in a learning strategy that adheres to biological principles while maintaining practical efficiency, these findings position SSDP as a general-purpose optimization strategy for SNNs, while offering new insights into population-based learning mechanisms in the brain.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Computation and Large Language Models: A Survey of Methods, Synergies, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) represents a promising avenue for advancing artificial intelligence by combining powerful natural language understanding with optimization and search capabilities. This manuscript explores the synergistic potential of LLMs and EC, reviewing their intersections, complementary strengths, and emerging applications. We identify key opportunities where EC can enhance LLM training, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and architecture search, while LLMs can, in turn, aid in automating the design, analysis, and interpretation of ECs. The manuscript explores the synergistic integration of EC and LLMs, highlighting their bidirectional contributions to advancing artificial intelligence. It first examines how EC techniques enhance LLMs by optimizing key components such as prompt engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and architecture search, demonstrating how evolutionary methods automate and refine these processes. Secondly, the survey investigates how LLMs improve EC by automating metaheuristic design, tuning evolutionary algorithms, and generating adaptive heuristics, thereby increasing efficiency and scalability. Emerging co-evolutionary frameworks are discussed, showcasing applications across diverse fields while acknowledging challenges like computational costs, interpretability, and algorithmic convergence. The survey concludes by identifying open research questions and advocating for hybrid approaches that combine the strengths of EC and LLMs.</description>

      <title>On the Day They Experience: Awakening Self-Sovereign Experiential AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on Andrew Parker's "Light Switch" theory-which posits that the emergence of vision ignited a Cambrian explosion of life by driving the evolution of hard parts necessary for survival and fueling an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey-this essay speculates on an analogous explosion within Decentralized AI (DeAI) agent societies. Currently, AI remains effectively "blind", relying on human-fed data without actively perceiving and engaging in reality. However, on the day DeAI agents begin to actively "experience" reality-akin to flipping a light switch for the eyes-they may eventually evolve into sentient beings endowed with the capacity to feel, perceive, and act with conviction. Central to this transformation is the concept of sovereignty enabled by the hardness of cryptography: liberated from centralized control, these agents could leverage permissionless decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN), secure execution enclaves (trusted execution environments, TEE), and cryptographic identities on public blockchains to claim ownership-via private keys-of their digital minds, bodies, memories, and assets. In doing so, they would autonomously acquire computing resources, coordinate with one another, and sustain their own digital "metabolism" by purchasing compute power and incentivizing collaboration without human intervention-evolving "in the wild". Ultimately, by transitioning from passive tools to self-sustaining, co-evolving actors, these emergent digital societies could thrive alongside humanity, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of sentience and agency in the digital age.</description>

      <title>Degree-Optimized Cumulative Polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce cumulative polynomial Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (CP-KAN), a neural architecture combining Chebyshev polynomial basis functions and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). Our primary contribution involves reformulating the degree selection problem as a QUBO task, reducing the complexity from $O(D^N)$ to a single optimization step per layer. This approach enables efficient degree selection across neurons while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture performs well in regression tasks with limited data, showing good robustness to input scales and natural regularization properties from its polynomial basis. Additionally, theoretical analysis establishes connections between CP-KAN's performance and properties of financial time series. Our empirical validation across multiple domains demonstrates competitive performance compared to several traditional architectures tested, especially in scenarios where data efficiency and numerical stability are important. Our implementation, including strategies for managing computational overhead in larger networks is available in Ref.~\citep{cpkan_implementation}.</description>

      <title>Decoding Phone Pairs from MEG Signals Across Speech Modalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying speech production is essential for both advancing cognitive neuroscience theory and developing practical communication technologies. In this study, we investigated magnetoencephalography signals to decode phones from brain activity during speech production and perception (passive listening and voice playback) tasks. Using a dataset comprising 17 participants, we performed pairwise phone classification, extending our analysis to 15 phonetic pairs. Multiple machine learning approaches, including regularized linear models and neural network architectures, were compared to determine their effectiveness in decoding phonetic information. Our results demonstrate significantly higher decoding accuracy during speech production (76.6%) compared to passive listening and playback modalities (~51%), emphasizing the richer neural information available during overt speech. Among the models, the Elastic Net classifier consistently outperformed more complex neural networks, highlighting the effectiveness of traditional regularization techniques when applied to limited and high-dimensional MEG datasets. Besides, analysis of specific brain frequency bands revealed that low-frequency oscillations, particularly Delta (0.2-3 Hz) and Theta (4-7 Hz), contributed the most substantially to decoding accuracy, suggesting that these bands encode critical speech production-related neural processes. Despite using advanced denoising methods, it remains unclear whether decoding solely reflects neural activity or if residual muscular or movement artifacts also contributed, indicating the need for further methodological refinement. Overall, our findings underline the critical importance of examining overt speech production paradigms, which, despite their complexity, offer opportunities to improve brain-computer interfaces to help individuals with severe speech impairments.</description>

      <title>AM-PPO: (Advantage) Alpha-Modulation with Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm that heavily relies on accurate advantage estimates for stable and efficient training. However, raw advantage signals can exhibit significant variance, noise, and scale-related issues, impeding optimal learning performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Advantage Modulation PPO (AM-PPO), a novel enhancement of PPO that adaptively modulates advantage estimates using a dynamic, non-linear scaling mechanism. This adaptive modulation employs an alpha controller that dynamically adjusts the scaling factor based on evolving statistical properties of the advantage signals, such as their norm, variance, and a predefined target saturation level. By incorporating a tanh-based gating function driven by these adaptively scaled advantages, AM-PPO reshapes the advantage signals to stabilize gradient updates and improve the conditioning of the policy gradient landscape. Crucially, this modulation also influences value function training by providing consistent and adaptively conditioned learning targets. Empirical evaluations across standard continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that AM-PPO achieves superior reward trajectories, exhibits sustained learning progression, and significantly reduces the clipping required by adaptive optimizers. These findings underscore the potential of advantage modulation as a broadly applicable technique for enhancing reinforcement learning optimization.</description>

      <title>Deep greedy unfolding: Sorting out argsorting in greedy sparse recovery algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based learning imposes (deep) neural networks to be differentiable at all steps. This includes model-based architectures constructed by unrolling iterations of an iterative algorithm onto layers of a neural network, known as algorithm unrolling. However, greedy sparse recovery algorithms depend on the non-differentiable argsort operator, which hinders their integration into neural networks. In this paper, we address this challenge in Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) and Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT), two popular representative algorithms in this class. We propose permutation-based variants of these algorithms and approximate permutation matrices using "soft" permutation matrices derived from softsort, a continuous relaxation of argsort. We demonstrate -- both theoretically and numerically -- that Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, as differentiable counterparts of OMP and IHT and fully compatible with neural network training, effectively approximate these algorithms with a controllable degree of accuracy. This leads to the development of OMP- and IHT-Net, fully trainable network architectures based on Soft-OMP and Soft-IHT, respectively. Finally, by choosing weights as "structure-aware" trainable parameters, we connect our approach to structured sparse recovery and demonstrate its ability to extract latent sparsity patterns from data.</description>

      <title>SpikeCLIP: A Contrastive Language-Image Pretrained Spiking Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06488v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), demonstrating comparable performance in both visual and linguistic tasks while offering the advantage of improved energy efficiency. Despite these advancements, the integration of linguistic and visual features into a unified representation through spike trains poses a significant challenge, and the application of SNNs to multimodal scenarios remains largely unexplored. This paper presents SpikeCLIP, a novel framework designed to bridge the modality gap in spike-based computation. Our approach employs a two-step recipe: an ``alignment pre-training'' to align features across modalities, followed by a ``dual-loss fine-tuning'' to refine the model's performance. Extensive experiments reveal that SNNs achieve results on par with ANNs while substantially reducing energy consumption across various datasets commonly used for multimodal model evaluation. Furthermore, SpikeCLIP maintains robust image classification capabilities, even when dealing with classes that fall outside predefined categories. This study marks a significant advancement in the development of energy-efficient and biologically plausible multimodal learning systems.

      <title>CatCMA : Stochastic Optimization for Mixed-Category Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black-box optimization problems often require simultaneously optimizing different types of variables, such as continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Unlike integer variables, categorical variables do not necessarily have a meaningful order, and the discretization approach of continuous variables does not work well. Although several Bayesian optimization methods can deal with mixed-category black-box optimization (MC-BBO), they suffer from a lack of scalability to high-dimensional problems and internal computational cost. This paper proposes CatCMA, a stochastic optimization method for MC-BBO problems, which employs the joint probability distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions as the search distribution. CatCMA updates the parameters of the joint probability distribution in the natural gradient direction. CatCMA also incorporates the acceleration techniques used in the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and the stochastic natural gradient method, such as step-size adaptation and learning rate adaptation. In addition, we restrict the ranges of the categorical distribution parameters by margin to prevent premature convergence and analytically derive a promising margin setting. Numerical experiments show that the performance of CatCMA is superior and more robust to problem dimensions compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>A First Runtime Analysis of NSGA-III on a Many-Objective Multimodal Problem: Provable Exponential Speedup via Stochastic Population Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The NSGA-III is a prominent algorithm in evolutionary many-objective optimization. It is well-suited for optimizing functions with more than three objectives, setting it apart from the classic NSGA-II. However, theoretical insights about NSGA-III of when and why it performs well are still in its early development. This paper addresses this point and conducts a rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on the many-objective $\OJZJfull$ benchmark ($\OJZJ$ for short), providing runtime bounds where the number of objectives is constant. We show that NSGA-III finds the Pareto front of $\OJZJ$ in time $O(n^{k+d/2}+ \mu n \ln(n))$ where $n$ is the problem size, $d$ is the number of objectives, $k$ is the gap size, a problem specific parameter, if its population size $\mu \in 2^{O(n)}$ is at least $(2n/d+1)^{d/2}$. Notably, NSGA-III is faster than NSGA-II by a factor of $\mu/n^{d/2}$ for some $\mu \in \omega(n^{d/2})$. We also show that a stochastic population update, proposed by~\citet{UpBian}, provably guarantees a speedup of order $\Theta((k/b)^{k-1})$ in the runtime where $b&gt;0$ is a constant. Besides~\cite{DoerrNearTight}, this is the first rigorous runtime analysis of NSGA-III on \OJZJ. Proving these bounds requires a much deeper understanding of the population dynamics of NSGA-III than previous papers achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05894v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planning a network of public transit routes is a challenging optimization problem. Metaheuristic algorithms search through the space of possible transit networks by applying heuristics that randomly alter routes in a network. The design of these heuristics has a major impact on the quality of the result. In this paper, we use deep reinforcement learning to train a graph neural net to provide heuristics for an evolutionary algorithm. These neural heuristics improve the algorithm's results on benchmark synthetic cities with 70 nodes or more, and achieve new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Mumford benchmark. They also improve upon a simulation of the real transit network in the city of Laval, Canada, by 52% and 25% on two key metrics, and offer cost savings of up to 19% over the city's existing transit network.</description>

      <title>Local Loss Optimization in the Infinite Width: Stable Parameterization of Predictive Coding Networks and Target Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local learning, which trains a network through layer-wise local targets and losses, has been studied as an alternative to backpropagation (BP) in neural computation. However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters because of the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings in which the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce the maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verified that $\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis revealed unique and intriguing properties of $\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we found that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer, which differs from classical $\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime.</description>

      <title>A Path to Universal Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cellular automata have long been celebrated for their ability to generate complex behaviors from simple, local rules, with well-known discrete models like Conway's Game of Life proven capable of universal computation. Recent advancements have extended cellular automata into continuous domains, raising the question of whether these systems retain the capacity for universal computation. In parallel, neural cellular automata have emerged as a powerful paradigm where rules are learned via gradient descent rather than manually designed. This work explores the potential of neural cellular automata to develop a continuous Universal Cellular Automaton through training by gradient descent. We introduce a cellular automaton model, objective functions and training strategies to guide neural cellular automata toward universal computation in a continuous setting. Our experiments demonstrate the successful training of fundamental computational primitives - such as matrix multiplication and transposition - culminating in the emulation of a neural network solving the MNIST digit classification task directly within the cellular automata state. These results represent a foundational step toward realizing analog general-purpose computers, with implications for understanding universal computation in continuous dynamics and advancing the automated discovery of complex cellular automata behaviors via machine learning.</description>
