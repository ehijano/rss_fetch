      <title>Parity-Dependent Real-Rootedness in Independence Polynomials of Generalized Petersen Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of zeros of the independence polynomial ${\rm I}(G, x)$ for the family of Generalized Petersen graphs ${\rm GP}(n, k)$ in the complex plane. While the independence numbers and coefficients of these graphs have been studied, the global behavior of their roots remains largely unexplored. Using an exact transfer matrix algorithm parameterized by $k$, we compute ${\rm I}({\rm GP}(n,k), x)$ for $n$ up to $30$ and $k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. Our numerical analysis reveals a striking parity-based dichotomy: for odd $k$, the roots exhibit complex conjugate structures accumulating on closed curves, whereas for even $k$, the roots appear to be strictly real and negative. Motivated by this evidence, we conjecture that ${\rm I}({\rm GP}(n,k), x)$ is real-rooted, and hence log-concave, if and only if $k$ is even. This phenomenon connects algebraic properties of ${\rm GP}(n,k)$ to questions about zero-free regions and limiting behavior in the hard-core lattice gas model.</description>

      <title>Total isolation game in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total isolation game is played on a graph $G$ by two players who take turns playing a vertex such that if $S$ is the set of already played vertices, then a vertex can be selected only if it is adjacent to a vertex that belongs to a (nontrivial) component of the graph $G - N_G(S)$ of order at least $2$ or a vertex that is isolated in $G - N_G(S)$ and belongs to the set $S$, where $N_G(S)$ is the set of vertices adjacent to a vertex in $S$. Dominator wishes to finish the game with the minimum number of played vertices, while Staller has the opposite goal. The game total isolation number $\iota_{\rm gt}(G)$ is the number of moves in the Dominator-start game where both players play optimally. We prove that if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n \ge 3$, then $\iota_{\rm gt}(G) &lt; \frac{5}{6}n$. Furthermore if $G$ has minimum degree at least $2$, then we prove that $\iota_{\rm gt}(G) \le \frac{3}{4}n$. More generally, if $G$ is a connected graph of order $n \ge 3$ with minimum degree $\delta$ where $\delta \ge 2$, then we prove that $\iota_{\rm gt}(G) \le \left( \frac{2\delta-1}{3\delta-2} \right) n$. Among other results it is proved that if $G$ is a graph of order $n$ with diameter $2$, then $\iota_{\rm gt}(G) \le \frac{2}{3}n$.</description>

      <title>Semi-Inducibility of some small graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a fixed graph whose edges are colored red and blue and let $\beta \in [0,1]$. Let $I(H, \beta)$ be the (asymptotically normalized) maximum number of copies of $H$ in a large red/blue edge-colored complete graph $G$, where the density of red edges in $G$ is $\beta$. This refines the problem of determining the semi-inducibility of $H$, which is itself a generalization of the classical question of determining the inducibility of $H$. The function $I(H, \beta)$ for $\beta \in [0,1]$ was not known for any graph $H$ on more than three vertices, except when $H$ is a monochromatic clique (Kruskal-Katona) or a monochromatic star (Reiher-Wagner). We obtain sharp results for some four and five vertex graphs, addressing several recent questions posed by various authors. We also obtain some general results for trees and stars. Many open problems remain.</description>

      <title>The quantum k-Bruhat order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of the quantum $k$-Bruhat order initiated in the work of Benedetti, Bergeron, Colmenarejo, Saliola, and Sottile concerning the quantum Murnaghan-Nakayama rule. Specifically, identifying maximal chains in intervals of the quantum $k$-Bruhat order with sequences of transpositions, we investigate a naturally associated free monoid $F_n^{\mathbf{q}}$ with an action on a $q$-extension of $S_n$, denoted $S_n[\mathbf{q}]$, which encodes the chain structure of the quantum $k$-Bruhat order. Aside from numerous structural results, our main contribution is an identification of a large family of equivalences satisfied by the elements of $F_n^{\mathbf{q}}$ as operators on $S_n[\mathbf{q}]$. In fact, we conjecture that our list of equivalences is complete. As a consequence of the quantum Monk's rule, a complete understanding of such equivalences can be used to gain information about the multiplicative structure of quantum Schubert polynomials.</description>

      <title>Four Dominion Growth Regimes in Trees: Forcing, Fibonacci Enumeration, Periodicity, and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dominion zeta(G), defined as the number of minimum dominating sets of a graph G, and analyze how local forcing and boundary effects control the flexibility of optimal domination in trees. For path-based pendant constructions, we identify a sharp forcing threshold: attaching a single pendant vertex to each path vertex yields complete independence with zeta = 2^gamma, whereas attaching two or more pendant vertices forces a unique minimum dominating set. Between these extremes, sparse pendant patterns produce intermediate behavior: removing endpoint pendants gives zeta = 2^(gamma - 2), while alternating pendant attachments induce Fibonacci growth zeta asymptotic to phi^gamma, where phi is the golden ratio. For complete binary trees T_h, we establish a rigid period-3 law zeta(T_h) in {1, 3} despite exponential growth in |V(T_h)|. We further prove a sharp stability bound under leaf deletions, zeta(T_h - X) &lt;= 2^{m_1(X)} zeta(T_h), where m_1(X) counts parents that lose exactly one child; in particular, deleting a single leaf preserves the domination number and exactly doubles the dominion.</description>

      <title>Exact Dominion of the Prism Graph: Enumeration by Congruence Class via Cyclic Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let G_n = C_n square P_2 denote the prism (circular ladder) graph on 2n vertices. By encoding column configurations as cyclic words, domination is reduced to local Boolean constraints on adjacent factors. This framework yields explicit formulas for the dominion zeta(G_n), stratified by n mod 4, with the exceptional cases n in {3, 6} confirmed computationally. Together with the known domination numbers gamma(G_n), these results expose distinct arithmetic regimes governing optimal domination, ranging from rigid forcing to substantial enumerative flexibility, and motivate quantitative parameters for assessing structural robustness in parametric graph families.</description>

      <title>On structural properties of some probable $R(3, 10)$-critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ramsey number $R(s, t)$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such that every graph on $n$ vertices contains either a clique of size $s$ or an independent set of size $t$. An $R(s,t)$-critical graph is a graph on $R(s,t)-1$ vertices that contains neither a clique of size $s$ nor an independent set of size $t$. It is known that $40\leq R(3, 10)\leq 42$. We study the structure of a $R(3,10)$-critical graphs by assuming $R(3, 10)=42$. We show that if such a graph exists then its minimum degree and vertex connectivity are the same and is $6, 7$ or $8$. Then we find all the possible degree sequences of such graphs. Further, we show that if such a graph exists, then its diameter is either $2$ or $3$, and if it has diameter $2$ and minimum degree $6$, then it has only $21$ choices for its degree sequence.</description>

      <title>On perfect matchings, edge-colourings and eigenvalues of cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the question whether the existence of perfect matchings in a cubic graph can be seen from the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. For regular graphs in general and for three edge-disjoint perfect matchings in a cubic graph (that is, an edge colouring with three colors) the answer is known to be negative. In the latter case, a few counter examples (found by computer) are known. Here we show that these counter examples can be extended to an infinite family by use of truncation. Thus we obtain infinitely many pairs of cospectral cubic graphs with different edge-chromatic number. For all these pairs both graphs have a perfect matching, and the mentioned question is still open. But we do find a new sufficient condition for a perfect matching in a cubic graphs in terms of its spectrum. In addition we obtain a few more results concerning spectral characterizations of cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Dowling's polynomial conjecture for independent sets of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Mason's conjecture states that the sequence of independent set numbers of any matroid is log-concave, and even ultra log-concave. The strong form of Mason's conjecture was independently solved by Anari, Liu, Oveis Gharan and Vinzant, and by Br\"and\'en and Huh. The weak form of Mason's conjecture was also generalized to a polynomial version by Dowling in 1980 by considering certain polynomial analogue of independent set numbers. In this paper we completely solve Dowling's polynomial conjecture by using the theory of Lorentzian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Strong Domination Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces and studies the stability of the strong domination number of a graph, denoted $\operatorname{st}_{\gamma_{st}}(G)$, defined as the minimum number of vertices whose removal changes the strong domination number $\gamma_{st}(G)$. We determine exact values of this stability parameter for several fundamental graph classes, including paths, cycles, wheels, complete bipartite graphs, friendship graphs, book graphs, and balanced complete multipartite graphs. General bounds on $\operatorname{st}_{\gamma_{st}}(G)$ are established, along with a Nordhaus Gaddum type inequality. The behavior of stability under graph operations such as join, corona, and Cartesian product is also investigated. Structural characterizations of graphs with given stability values are provided, and several open problems and directions for future research are outlined.</description>

      <title>Pattern expansions of permutation statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the expansions of permutation statistics in the basis of functions counting occurrences of a fixed pattern in a permutation. We show the finiteness of these pattern expansions for a class of permutation statistics including the higher moment statistics, generalizing a result of Berman and Tenner. We also give a combinatorial criterion for the positivity of pattern expansions. Using this criterion, we show that the pattern expansion of the number of reduced words of a permutation is positive and give an enumerative interpretation for the coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schur multiple zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03970v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur multiple zeta function was defined as a multivariable function by Nakasuji-Phuksuwan-Yamasaki. Inspired by the product formula of Schur functions, the products of Schur multiple zeta functions have been studied. While the product of two Schur functions expands as a linear combination of Schur functions, it is known that a similar expansion for the product of Schur multiple zeta functions can be obtained by symmetrizing, i.e., by taking the summation over all permutations of the variables. In this paper, we present a more refined formula by restricting the summation from the full symmetric group to its specific subgroup.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between spread and width for tree decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between (average) spread and width in tree decompositions, answering several questions from Wood [arXiv:2509.01140]. The spread of a vertex $v$ in a tree decomposition is the number of bags that contain $v$. Wood asked for which $c&gt;0$, there exists $c'$ such that each graph $G$ has a tree decomposition of width $c\cdot tw(G)$ in which each vertex $v$ has spread at most $c'(d(v)+1)$. We show that $c\geq 2$ is necessary and that $c&gt;3$ is sufficient. Moreover, we answer a second question fully by showing that near-optimal average spread can be achieved simultaneously with width $O(tw(G))$.</description>

      <title>Exact Bounds for Forbidden Configurations and the Extremal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a $k\times \ell$ (0,1)-matrix. A matrix is simple if it is a (0,1)-matrix with no repeated columns. A (0,1)-matrix $A$ is said to have a $F$ as a configuration if there is a submatrix of $A$ which is a row and column permutation of $F$. In the language of sets, a configuration is a trace.
  Let $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$ be all simple $m$-rowed matrices $A$ with no configuration $F$. Define $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)$ as the maximum number of columns of any matrix in $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$. The $2\times (p+1)$ (0,1)-matrix $F(0,p,1,0)$ consists of a row of $p$ 1's and a row of one 1 in the remaining column. The paper determines $\mathrm{forb}(m,F(0,p,1,0))$ for $1\le p\le 9$ and the extremal matrices are characterized. A construction may be extremal for all $p$.</description>

Abstract: Let ${\mathbb F}$ be a (not necessarily finite) field. A subspace of the vector space ${\mathbb F}^n$ is called {\it non-degenerate} if it is not contained in a coordinate hyperplane. We show that the Grassmann graph of $k$-dimensional subspaces of ${\mathbb F}^n$, $1&lt;k&lt;n-1$, can be recovered from the subgraph of non-degenerate subspaces if $|{\mathbb F}|&gt;n-k$. In the case when ${\mathbb F}={\mathbb F}_q$ is the field of $q$ elements, this subgraph is known as the graph of non-degenerate linear $[n,k]_q$ codes.</description>

      <title>Saturation property fails for Schubert coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The saturation property for Littlewood--Richardson coefficients was established by Knutson and Tao in 1999. In 2004, Kirillov conjectured that the saturation property extends to Schubert coefficients. We disprove this conjecture in a strong form, by showing that it fails for a large family of instances. We also refute the saturation property for Schubert coefficients under bit scaling and discuss computational complexity implications.</description>

      <title>Rank metric codes from Drinfeld modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between Drinfeld modules and rank metric codes, focusing on the case of semifield codes. Our framework constructs rank metric codes from linear subspaces of endomorphisms of a Drinfeld module, using tools such as characteristic polynomials on Tate modules and the Chebotarev density theorem. We show that Sheekey's construction [She20] fits naturally into this setting, yielding a short conceptual proof of one of his main results. We then give a new construction of infinite families of semifield codes arising from Drinfeld modules defined over finite fields.</description>

      <title>On difference sets of dense subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. In [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453, Problem 2] Fish asked whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that \[ k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}. \] Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that \[ k \cdot FS(\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}, \] where $FS(\langle x_n \rangle)$ denotes the finite sums set generated by the sequence.</description>

Abstract: This is an analysis of the status of Brooks' Theorem, a celebrated result in graph coloring, from the point of view of Reverse Mathematics. We prove that the restriction of Brooks' theorem to bounded graphs of degree greater than or equal to $3$ is provable in $\mathsf{RCA}_0$, while the statement for arbitrary graphs is equivalent to $\mathsf{WKL}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$. Brooks' Theorem for degree $2$, even when restricted to bounded graphs, is equivalent to $\mathsf{WKL}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}_0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct gradings on the simple modules of 2-boundary Temperley--Lieb algebras and symplectic blob algebras by realising the latter algebras as quotients of Varagnolo--Vasserot's orientifold quiver Hecke algebras. We prove that the symplectic blob algebras are graded cellular and provide a conjectural algorithm for calculating their graded decomposition matrices. In doing so, we give the first explicit family of finite-dimensional graded quotients of the orientifold quiver Hecke algebras, providing a new entry point for the structure of these algebras -- in the spirit of Libedinsky--Plaza's ``blob algebra approach'' to modular representation theory.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of independent sets for finite, atomic, and graded lattices, extending the well-known cryptomorphism between geometric lattices and matroids. This construction leads to an embedding theorem into geometric lattices that preserves the set of atoms. We then apply these results to adjoint matroids, providing new characterizations of adjoints and partially proving a conjecture on the combinatorial derived matroid. Finally, we use our characterization of adjoints to compute the adjoint lists of several simple examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many complex systems show non-pairwise interactions, which can be captured by hypergraphs. In this work, we propose an edge-swapping method to sample random directed hypergraphs with fixed vertex and hyperarc degrees, which can be applied to different classes of directed hypergraphs (containing self-loops, degenerate hyperarcs and/or multi-hyperarcs). We prove that this method indeed samples uniformly from the classes with self-loops and multi-hyperarcs, and that the method may not sample uniformly from classes without self-loops, or with self-loops and degenerate hyperarcs but without multi-hyperarcs. We present a partial result on the class with self-loops, but without degenerate hyperarcs or multi-hyperarcs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be the {\em superspace ring} of polynomial-valued differential forms on affine $n$-space. The natural action of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on $n$-space induces an action of $\mathfrak{S}_n$ on $\Omega$. The {\em superspace coinvariant ring} is the quotient $SR$ of $\Omega$ by the ideal generated by $\mathfrak{S}_n$-invariants with vanishing constant term. We give the first explicit basis of $SR$, proving a conjecture of Sagan and Swanson. Our techniques use the theory of hyperplane arrangements. We relate $SR$ to instances of the Solomon-Terao algebras of Abe-Maeno-Murai-Numata and use exact sequences relating the derivation modules of certain `southwest closed' arrangements to obtain the desired basis of $SR$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18343v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials were introduced by Hwang, Jang, Kim, Song, and Song. There exist two combinatorial models for these polynomials: one using hook-valued tableaux and the other using pairs of a semistandard Young tableau and (what we call) an exquisite tableau. An uncrowding algorithm on hook-valued tableaux was introduced by Pan, Pappe, Poh, and Schilling. In this paper, we discover a novel connection between the two models via the uncrowding and Goulden--Greene's jeu de taquin algorithms, using a classical result of Benkart, Sottile, and Stroomer on tableau switching. This connection reveals a symmetry of the uncrowding algorithm defined on hook-valued tableaux. As a corollary, we obtain another combinatorial model for the refined canonical stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of biflagged tableaux, which naturally appear in the characterization of the image of the uncrowding map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of my paper "Lattices of flats for symplectic matroids". We explore geometric constructions originating from the lattice of flats of ranked symplectic matroids. We observe that a ranked symplectic matroid always sits between two ordinary matroids and use this fact to prove that it has many of the same properties of ordinary matroids. We compute the dimension of its order complex using its M\"obius function, We show that its matroid polytope is geometrically defined using its flats and connected to its Bergman fan. We finish by highlighting differences between its toric variety and the toric variety of an ordinary matroid, and give a partial proof of Mason's conjecture for ranked symplectic matroids.</description>

      <title>Lattice points in polytope boundaries and formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the number of lattice points in the boundary of a positive integer dilate of a Delzant integral polytope is a polynomial in the dilation parameter, analogous to the Ehrhart polynomial giving the number of lattice points in a lattice polytope. We give an explicit formula for this polynomial, analogous to the formula of Khovanskii-Pukhlikov for the Ehrhart polynomial. These counting polynomials satisfy a lacunarity principle, the vanishing of alternate coefficients, quite unlike the Ehrhart polynomial. We show that formal geometric quantization of singular Calabi Yau hypersurfaces in smooth toric varieties gives this polynomial, in analogy with the relation of the Khovanskii-Pukhlikov formula to the geometric quantization of toric varieties. The Atiyah-Singer theorem for the index of the Dirac operator gives a moral argument for the lacunarity of the counting polynomial. We conjecture that similar formulas should hold for arbitrary simple integral polytope boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles so that vertices along the common boundary are arranged cyclically. What is the maximal number of sides such union - call it regular - can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. In this paper we prove that the sequence starts as 3, 12, 22, 33, 45, 56, 67, 80, 91, and satisfies simple linear lower and upper bounds. The latter is not only a bound, but in fact is realizable combinatorially. The questions whether it can be realized in pseudoline geometry, and, if so, whether such constructions are stretchable, are the next natural ones to pose. The paper is mostly expository and written in an informal style. However, it adds a new tool in investigating unions of objects; namely, triangulation shifts.</description>

Abstract: Given a graph $G$, a set $F$ of edges is an edge dominating set if all edges in $G$ are either in $F$ or adjacent to an edge in $F$. $G$ is said to be well-edge-dominated if every minimal edge dominating set is also minimum. In 2022, it was proven that there are precisely three nonbipartite, well-edge-dominated graphs with girth at least four. Then in 2025, a characterization of all well-edge-dominated graphs containing exactly one triangle was found. In this paper, we characterize all well-edge-dominated graphs that contain a triangle and yet are $K_4$-free.</description>

      <title>On Matsushita $\pi_1^2$ discrete fundamental groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Matsushita fundamental groups of a graph $X$, denoted $\pi_1^r(X)$, are certain discrete versions of the fundamental group for topological spaces. For $r=2$, these groups have a nice combinatorial description, due to Sankar. In this paper we prove two results about $\pi_1^2$. First, we prove a Seifert-van Kampen-type theorem. Similar results have previously been obtained by Barcelo, et al. (and strengthened by Kapulkin and Mavinkurve) for a different notion of discrete fundamental group. Second, we prove that an arbitrary group $G$ can be realized as $\pi_1^2(X)$ for some graph $X$. Our construction works equally well for the aforementioned alternate discrete fundamental group $A_1(X)$, and our second result thus also provides an entirely different method of proof for a theorem of Kapulkin and Mavinkurve.</description>

      <title>Diagonal Simplicial Tensor Modules and Algebraic $n$-Hypergroupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative ring, let $k\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, and let $\vec{s}=(n_1,\dots,n_k)\in(\mathbb{Z}^+)^k$ with $n=\min_a(n_a)-1$. We attach to $\vec{s}$ a diagonal simplicial tensor module $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ whose $p$-simplices are functions on a cosimplicial index set $I_p(\vec{s})\subseteq \mathbb{N}^k$. This extends Quillen's diagonal on double semi-simplicial groups: $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ is obtained by restricting a $k$-fold simplicial $A$-module along the diagonal $p\mapsto(p,\ldots,p)$.
  Using a ``missing indices'' description of face kernels, we compute the horn kernels $R_{p,j}(X)$ and show that $R_{p,j}(X)\neq 0$ if and only if $k\ge p$, independently of $j$. Consequently, $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ is an algebraic $n$-hypergroupoid in the sense of Duskin (1979) and Glenn (1982) if and only if $k\le n$, and horn fillers in dimension $n$ are non-unique if and only if $k\ge n$; in particular it is strict precisely when $k=n$. A Horn Non-Degeneracy Lemma shows that, for $p\ge 1$, $R_{p,j}(X)\cap D_p(X)=\{0\}$ and yields a decomposition $X_p=R_{p,j}(X)\oplus D_p(X)$. An explicit shift-and-truncate chain homotopy, equivariant under $\operatorname{Stab}(\vec{s})$ and compatible with a natural filtration, contracts $X_\bullet(\vec{s};A)$ and forces the associated spectral sequence to collapse at $E_1$.
  When $A$ is an infinite field $K$, we study simplicial submodules generated by a single tensor via kernel sequences and a moduli map to a product of Grassmannians. The moduli map image is an irreducible and unirational constructible subset of a determinantal incidence variety.</description>

Abstract: Weingarten functions provide a tool for computing Haar measure matrix integrals of polynomials in the matrix entries. An important property of Weingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017 Benoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten functions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \to \infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$ limit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already has applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not optimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to $n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)\}$. The proof proceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we call the unitary (orthogonal) $\textit{Weingarten process}$. We believe this process may have further applications to the theory of Weingarten functions. We also prove two new bounds regarding the large $N$ limit of the Weingarten function in the regimes when $n=o(N^{4/5})$, and $n=o(N)$.</description>

      <title>Distribution of the cokernels of determinantal row-sparse matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the cokernels of random row-sparse integral matrices $A_n$ according to the determinantal measure from a structured matrix $B_n$ with a parameter $k_n \ge 3$. Under a mild assumption on the growth rate of $k_n$, we prove that the distribution of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of the cokernel of $A_n$ converges to that of Cohen--Lenstra for every prime $p$. Our result extends the work of A. M\'esz\'aros which established convergence to the Cohen--Lenstra distribution when $p \ge 5$ and $k_n=3$ for all positive integers $n$.</description>

      <title>Strong Sparsification for 1-in-3-SAT via Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for 1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$. This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem} (Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad, Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).</description>

      <title>Graphs arising from the dual Steenrod algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Wood's graph theoretic interpretation of certain quotients of the mod $2$ dual Steenrod algebra to quotients of the mod $p$ dual Steenrod algebra where $p$ is an odd prime and to quotients of the $C_2$-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra. We establish connectedness criteria for graphs associated to monomials in these algebra quotients and investigate questions about trees and Hamilton cycles in these settings. We also give graph theoretic interpretations of algebraic structures such as the coproduct and antipode arising from the Hopf algebra structure on the mod $p$ dual Steenrod algebra and the Hopf algebroid structure of the $C_2$-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra.</description>

      <title>Twisted Cherednik systems and non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenfunctions of many-body system Hamiltonians associated with generalized (a-twisted) Cherednik operators used in construction of other Hamiltonians: those arising from commutative subalgebras of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra. The simplest example of these eigenfunctions is provided by non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials, while generally they are constructed basing on the ground state eigenfunction coinciding with the twisted Baker-Akhiezer function being a peculiar (symmetric) eigenfunction of the DIM Hamiltonians. Moreover, the eigenfunctions admit an expansion with universal coefficients so that the dependence on the twist $a$ is hidden only in these ground state eigenfunctions, and we suggest a general formula that allows one to construct these eigenfunctions from non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials. This gives a new twist in theory of integrable systems, which usually puts an accent on symmetric polynomials, and provides a new dimension to the {\it triad} made from the symmetric Macdonald polynomials, untwisted Baker-Akhiezer functions and Noumi-Shiraishi series.</description>

      <title>The Sequence Reconstruction of Permutations under Hamming Metric with Small Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sequence reconstruction problem asks for the recovery of a sequence from multiple noisy copies, where each copy may contain up to $r$ errors. In the case of permutations on \(n\) letters under the Hamming metric, this problem is closely related to the parameter $N(n,r)$, the maximum intersection size of two Hamming balls of radius $r$. While previous work has resolved \(N(n,r)\) for small radii (\(r \leq 4\)) and established asymptotic bounds for larger \(r\), we present new exact formulas for \(r \in \{5,6,7\}\) using group action techniques. In addition, we develop a formula for \(N(n,r)\) based on the irreducible characters of the symmetric group \(S_n\), along with an algorithm that enables computation of \(N(n,r)\) for larger parameters, including cases such as \(N(43,8)\) and \(N(24,14)\).</description>
