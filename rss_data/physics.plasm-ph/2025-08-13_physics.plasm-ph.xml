      <title>Generation of High Order Harmonics in Vacuum for Various Configurations of Interacting Electromagnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High order harmonic (HOH) generation by interacting extremely intense electromagnetic waves in the quantum vacuum is investigated within the framework of the Heisenberg-Euler formalism. We consider here the process in the lowest order of a perturbation theory relative to the electromagnetic (EM) beam intensity, giving contribution to the HOH generation. The main expressions are obtained for a general geometry, whyle polarizations of different sub-beams forming the EM beam focus are almost the same. Nevertheless, explicit expressions for the HOH generation are derived for the $4\pi$-dipole in-coming waves and for the two crossing Gaussian beams. The former geometry of the EM beam is optimal at a given EM wave power, whereas the latter one is more realistic from the experimental point of view. We consider also a relationship of our present general results with the results, obtained earlier for the HOH generation during of collision of two plane electromagnetic waves.</description>

      <title>Surface Current Optimization and Coil-Cutting Algorithms for Stage-Two Stellarator Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarator optimization often takes a two-stage approach, where in the first stage the boundary is varied in order to optimize for some physics metrics, while in the second stage the boundary is kept fixed and coils are sought to generate a magnetic field that can recreate the desired stellarator. Past literature dealing with this stage lacks details on the coil cutting procedure and the mathematical and physical properties of the surface current potential which dictates it. In this work, some basic physical quantities of the surface current and how they relate to the parameters in the current potential are presented, and supported for the first time by explicit mathematical derivations. Additionally, the details of how to account for the presence of an external field in the surface current algorithm are explicitly presented. These relations underpin the procedure of discretizing the surface current into coils. Finally, the conventionally-used algorithm for discretizing the surface current into coils is detailed, along with an example coil optimization for both a modular and a helical coilset. The algorithm is implemented in the \texttt{DESC} code, with both modular and helical coil capabilities, where it is available for use in stellarator coil design.</description>

      <title>The Enhancement of Ion Heating in Kinetic, Anti-Parallel Reconnection in the Presence of a Flow Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic effects of upstream, magnetic field-aligned, flow shear on anti-parallel magnetic reconnection using 2.5D Particle-In-Cell simulations. Our results demonstrate that flow shear significantly alters the reconnection process, leading to enhanced ion heating, reduced outflow speeds, and a modified reconnection geometry. In contrast to previous Hall Magnetohydrodynaic (MHD) studies, we find that reconnection becomes a more efficient plasma heating mechanism in the presence of sub-Alfv\'enic flow shear, with ion heating increasing by as much as 300\%. This enhanced heating is achieved by efficiently converting the incoming flow shear energy into thermal energy through istropization in the exhaust. The enhanced heating leads to a pressure gradient away form the x-line exerting a force that reduces the outflow jet speed and slows down the reconnection process. This conversion is due to beam selection effects, mixing and scattering in the exhaust. A theoretical model is developed which predicts well the exhaust heating and outflow speed reduction. These results offer a potential explanation for recent Parker Solar Probe observations of suppressed reconnection in the presence of flow shear and carry significant implications for energy dissipation in turbulent plasmas.</description>

      <title>Extracting temperature of plasma through fusion reactions within a transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the method of extracting the temperature from weighted proton-to-neutron yield ratio from fusion reactions as in the previous experiment~[W. Bang, {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 055002 (2013).] using the Texas Petawatt laser beam. The Coulomb explosion of deuterium clusters is simulated based on the particle-in-cell model in a box system with periodic boundary conditions, and fusion reactions are incorporated through the stochastic method. As long as the deuteron numbers in deuterium clusters follow a log-normal distribution, the low-energy part of the final deuteron spectrum can be fitted by a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, while there are more deuterons in the intermediate- and high-energy region compared to a thermal distribution, and dominate the weighted yield ratio. Therefore, the effective temperature extracted from the weighted yield ratio is generally higher than that from fitting the final deuteron spectrum. The local density fluctuation, which intrinsically exists due to the log-normal distribution of deuteron numbers, further enhances hot deuteron-deuteron collisions, and significantly affects the weighted yield ratio.</description>

      <title>Exact expressions for nonperturbative guiding center theory in symmetric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a recently-developed nonperturbative guiding center formalism to charged particle dynamics in fields with two-parameter continuous symmetry groups. This entails finding exact constants of motion, valid in the nonperturbative regime, that agree with Kruskal's adiabatic invariant series to all orders in the perturbative regime, when the field scale length is large compared with a typical gyroradius. We demonstrate that the nonperturbative guiding center model makes exact predictions in these cases, even though it eliminates the cyclotron timescale, thereby establishing a theoretical baseline for performance of the nonperturbative formalism.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Physics of the Plasma Liner Experiment: A Multi-dimensional Study with FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) is a platform that seeks to achieve fusion via a concept known as Plasma-Jet-Driven Magneto-Inertial Fusion (PJMIF). The experiment consists of three main phases: (1) target formation in which up to four plasma guns shoot magnetized hydrogen or deuterium-tritium jets to form a quasi-spherical target, (2) liner formation in which a constellation of 36 guns fire high-atomic number (e.g., xenon) jets to form a liner shell, and (3) target compression in which the formed liner implodes the pre-formed target. Each phase of the PLX probes different plasma regimes with different physics at play, thus we simulated each phase separately and with multiple codes. Here we highlight some of the 1D, 2D, and 3D simulation results of all three phases from the FLASH, OSIRIS, and HELIOS codes. Some of the key physical processes involved include shock dynamics, kinetic effects, anisotropic thermal conduction, resistive magnetic diffusion, radiation transport, and magnetized jet dynamics. Our simulations show that the PLX can form a preheated (~40 eV), magnetized (electron Hall parameter &gt;1) target plasma, and a quasi-collisional liner shell that can subsequently compress the target to fusion-relevant conditions (e.g., temperatures &gt;1 keV).</description>

      <title>Thermal gradient effect on hydrogen transport in tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One key challenge for efficiency and safety in fusion devices is the retention of tritium (T) in plasma-facing components. Tritium retention generates radioactive concerns and decreases the amount of fuel available to generate power. Hence, understanding the behavior of T in tungsten (W), as the main candidate as armor material, is critical to the deployment of fusion as a reliable energy source. In this work, we have studied the effect of a thermal gradient in the transport properties of hydrogen (as a T surrogate) in pure W. Strong thermal gradients develop in the divertor as a result of the intense energy fluxes arriving at the material. We have developed an analytical approach to compute the heat of transport ($Q^*$) that is parameterized from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. $Q^*$ is a parameter needed in irreversible thermodynamics frameworks to understand mass transport in the presence of thermal gradients. We show that $Q^*$ can be written as a function of temperature, temperature gradient, a characteristic length and the ratio of the rates towards hot and cold regions. Furthermore, we describe how, to first order, the dependence of $Q^*$ on the thermal gradient vanishes, in agreement with MD results. On average, we find $Q^*=-5.41\times 10^{-3}kT^2~\text{eV}$ for H in pure W, with $k$ the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative Lightning Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between Category A and B upward positive lightning pulses and the "Classical" and "Narrow" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest common physical mechanisms underlying both upward and downward lightning initiation processes, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic finite difference scheme for anisotropic diffusion equations: preserving the discrete maximum principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A hyperbolic system approach is proposed for robust computation of anisotropic diffusion equations that appear in quasineutral plasmas. Though the approach exhibits merits of high extensibility and accurate flux computation, the monotonicity of the scheme for anisotropic diffusion cases has not been understood. In this study, the discrete maximum principle (DMP) of the hyperbolic system approach is analyzed and tested in various anisotropic diffusion cases. A mathematical analysis is conducted to obtain an optimal condition of an arbitrary parameter to guarantee the DMP, and numerical experiments reveal an adoptive selection of the parameter for DMP-preserving results. It is confirmed that, with an appropriate preconditioning matrix and parameter choice, the hyperbolic system approach preserves the DMP even with a linear discretization.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Measurements of Ca XIX Dielectronic Recombination Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the K$\alpha$ emission from the astrophysically very abundant Ca XIX (He-like ion) and its satellite lines resonantly excited by dielectronic recombination (DR). We achieve an electron-energy resolution of 8 eV in a cryogenic electron beam ion trap, and determine the energies of the exciting electrons and the emitted photons up to the KLn ($n\le 8$) manifold with $0.05\%$ and $0.1\%$ respective uncertainties. For the KLL satellites, energies agree very well with our predictions using the Flexible Atomic Code (FAC) and previous state-of-the-art calculations. Our calculations also agree with our experimental direct excitation cross-sections for K$\alpha$ within their $10\%$ uncertainty. We extract DR coefficient rates and find good agreement with values tabulated in the OPEN-ADAS database. As an application, we experimentally benchmark Ca XIX atomic data used to model high-temperature astrophysical plasmas by comparing FAC synthetic spectra with recent XRISM observations revealing the contributions of DR satellites to the Ca XIX lines.</description>

      <title>Absolute constraints on the magnetic field evolution in tokamak power plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Issues of tokamak power plants, such as maximum possible length of a pulse of fusion power, the required time between fusion pulses, and the evolution of the current profile towards disruptive states, are tightly constrained by a simple evolution equation for the magnetic field. This equation follows from Faraday's Law and the mathematical relation between the magnetic and the electric fields. The validity of detailed simulations is tested by consistency with Faraday's Law, not the other way around. The evolution equation suggests methods of avoiding the limitations of these constraints. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) is proceeding on a fast timescale to operate a fusion power plant -- even writing contracts on the power to be produced by their ARC tokamak. This makes it important to determine the issues that should be studied by SPARC, which is the tokamak that CFS is building to address issues before ARC is built. The STEP prototype of a spherical tokamak power plant in the United Kingdom is on a similar fast timescale. Feasible simulations from startup to shutdown for prototype plasmas could greatly clarify these constraints and the feasibility of their avoidance. This paper has two purposes: (1) Illustrate issues on which research must be focused for the credibility tokamak power plants. (2) Encourage thought on the allocation of resources among the various fusion concepts to minimize the time and the cost to the achievement of practical fusion power.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fusion power plant design space: comparative analysis of positive and negative triangularity tokamaks through optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal configuration choice between positive triangularity (PT) and negative triangularity (NT) tokamaks for fusion power plants hinges on navigating different operational constraints rather than achieving specific plasma performance metrics. This study presents a systematic comparison using constrained multi-objective optimization with the integrated FUsion Synthesis Engine (FUSE) framework. Over 200,000 integrated design evaluations were performed exploring the trade-offs between capital cost minimization and operational reliability (maximizing $q_{95}$) while satisfying engineering constraints including 250 $\pm$ 50 MW net electric power, tritium breeding ratio $&gt;$1.1, power exhaust limits and an hour flattop time. Both configurations achieve similar cost-performance Pareto fronts through contrasting design philosophies. PT, while demonstrating resilience to pedestal degradation (compensating for up to 40% reduction), are constrained to larger machines ($R_0$ $&gt;$ 6.5 m) by the narrow operational window between L-H threshold requirements and the research-established power exhaust limit ($P_{sol}/R$ $&lt;$ 15 MW/m). This forces optimization through comparatively reduced magnetic field ($\sim$8T). NT configurations exploit their freedom from these constraints to access compact, high-field designs ($R_0 \sim 5.5$ m, $B_0$ $&gt;$ 12 T), creating natural synergy with advancing HTS technology. Sensitivity analyses reveal that PT's economic viability depends critically on uncertainties in L-H threshold scaling and power handling limits. Notably, a 50% variation in either could eliminate viable designs or enable access to the compact design space. These results suggest configuration selection should be risk-informed: PT offers the lowest-cost path when operational constraints can be confidently predicted, while NT is robust to large variations in constraints and physics uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Electron Heating in Electron-Only Reconnection in a Laboratory Mini-Magnetosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of electron heating in electron-only magnetic reconnection in laser-driven laboratory mini-magnetospheres on the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles. In this experiment, a fast-flowing plasma impacts a pulsed magnetic dipole embedded within LAPD's magnetized ambient plasma, creating an ion-scale magnetosphere and driving electron-only magnetic reconnection between the background and dipole field lines. The electron velocity distribution is measured across the reconnection region using non-collective Thomson scattering, enabling determination of electron temperature and density. Significant electron heating is observed in the electron diffusion region, increasing from an initial temperature of 1.8 eV to 9.5 eV, corresponding to a 40\% conversion of Poynting flux into electron enthalpy flux. Particle-in-cell simulations that provide insights into the heating mechanisms are also presented.</description>

      <title>On the stability analysis of astrophysical cooling functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To model the temperature evolution of optically thin astrophysical environments at MHD scales, radiative and collisional cooling rates are typically either pre-tabulated or fit into a functional form and then input into MHD codes as a radiative loss function. Thermal balance requires estimates of the analogous heating rates, which are harder to calculate, and due to uncertainties in the underlying dissipative heating processes, these rates are often simply parameterized. The resulting net cooling function defines an equilibrium curve that varies with density and temperature. Such cooling functions can make the gas prone to thermal instability (TI), which will cause departures from equilibrium. There has been no systematic study of thermally unstable parameter space for nonequilibrium states. Motivated by our recent finding that there is a related linear instability, catastrophic cooling instability, that can dominate over TI, here we carry out such a study. We show that Balbus' instability criteria for TI can be used to define a critical cooling rate, $\Lambda_c$, that permits a nonequilibrium analysis of cooling functions through the mapping of TI zones. We furthermore extend Balbus' criteria to account for thermal conduction. Upon applying a $\Lambda_c$-based stability analysis to coronal loop simulations, we find that loops undergoing periodic episodes of coronal rain formation are linearly unstable to catastrophic cooling instability, while TI is stabilized by thermal conduction.</description>

Abstract: Slow manifold reduction and the theory of Poisson-Dirac submanifolds are used to deduce a Hamiltonian formulation for a quasineutral limit of the planar, collisionless, magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system. Motion on the slow manifold models plasma dynamics free of fast Langmuir oscillations. Preservation of quasineutrality requires the bulk plasma flow is incompressible. The electric field is determined by counterbalancing plasma stresses that would otherwise produce compression. The Hamiltonian structure for the quasineutral model synthesizes well-known Poisson brackets for incompressible fluids and collisionless kinetic equations.</description>
