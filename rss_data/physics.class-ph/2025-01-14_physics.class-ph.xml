      <title>Remarks on classical pseudo-electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical studies as the conservation laws and the radiation fields are investigated in the pseudo-electrodynamics. We explore the action symmetry under infinitesimal transformations to obtain the energy-momentum, the Belinfante-Rosenfeld, and the general angular momentum tensors for this nonlocal planar electrodynamics. Through the results such as the retarded potentials and fields generated by a point particle in an arbitrary motion, we study the radiation of an electric dipole and it radiated power in 1+2 dimensions. In addition, we propose a way to introduce magnetic monopoles in pseudo-electrodynamics, in which the solutions and conservation laws are also presented.</description>

      <title>Acceleration deforms exponential decays into generalized Zipf-Mandelbrot laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18151v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exponentially decaying system looks as if its decay was a generalized power or double-exponential law, provided one takes into account the relativistic time dilation in a detector, the delay of the emitted signal, and the accelerations of both the source and the detector. The same mathematical formula can be found in generalizations of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law in quantitative linguistics and in the dynamics of ligand binding in heme proteins. The effect is purely kinematic and is not related to the various dynamic phenomena that can accompany accelerated motion of sources or detectors. The procedure used can also be seen as a form of clock synchronization near an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Partially Coherent Crystalline Undulator Radiation from a Positron Bunch Modulated via the SASE XFEL Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Crystalline undulator (CU), where the positrons of a bunch are channeled planarly, is considered. In contrast to channeling radiation, CU radiation (CUR) occurs due to the average sinusoidal motion of positrons. Taking into account the medium polarization, besides hard photons, soft photons are also generated. In the SASE XFEL process, microbunching occurs with a longitudinal size on the order of the wavelength of the stimulated radiation due to the interaction between positrons and generated photons at zero angle. These microbunches in CU will radiate coherently, and the radiation of the bunch will be partially coherent. Charged particles organized into a microbunch with a well-defined spatial phase distribution can emit coherent (synergistic or collective) radiation when the wavelength of the emitted radiation is comparable to or longer than the longitudinal size of the microbunch. The CU parameters, the spatial period and the amplitude, are selected to preserve both the channeling phenomenon of positrons and the coherence of CUR from positron microbunches. The gain of spontaneous radiation depends on the modulation depth of the microbunch, which is a critical parameter of the bunch and can also be determined through the proposed experiment. A numerical analysis has been conducted for a specific case involving CUR generated by a positron bunch modulated during the SASE XFEL, at a corresponding wavelength of the process.</description>
