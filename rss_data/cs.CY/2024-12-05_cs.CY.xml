      <title>Artificial Intelligence Policy Framework for Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various sectors and institutions, including education and healthcare. Although AI offers immense potential for innovation and problem solving, its integration also raises significant ethical concerns, such as privacy and bias. This paper delves into key considerations for developing AI policies within institutions. We explore the importance of interpretability and explainability in AI elements, as well as the need to mitigate biases and ensure privacy. Additionally, we discuss the environmental impact of AI and the importance of energy-efficient practices. The culmination of these important components is centralized in a generalized framework to be utilized for institutions developing their AI policy. By addressing these critical factors, institutions can harness the power of AI while safeguarding ethical principles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural heritage, a testament to human history and civilization, has gained increasing recognition for its significance in preservation and dissemination. The integration of immersive technologies has transformed how cultural heritage is presented, enabling audiences to engage with it in more vivid, intuitive, and interactive ways. However, the adoption of these technologies also brings a range of challenges and potential risks. This paper presents a systematic review, with an in-depth analysis of 177 selected papers. We comprehensively examine and categorize current applications, technological approaches, and user devices in immersive cultural heritage presentations, while also highlighting the associated risks and challenges. Furthermore, we identify areas for future research in the immersive presentation of cultural heritage. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive reference for researchers and practitioners, enhancing understanding of the technological applications, risks, and challenges in this field, and encouraging further innovation and development.</description>

      <title>Measuring and Forecasting Conversation Incivility: the Role of Antisocial and Prosocial Behaviors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the task of measuring and forecasting incivility in conversations following replies to hate speech. Identifying replies that steer conversations away from hatred and elicit civil follow-up conversations sheds light into effective strategies to engage with hate speech and proactively avoid further escalation. We propose new metrics that take into account various dimensions of antisocial and prosocial behaviors to measure the conversation incivility following replies to hate speech. Our best metric aligns with human perceptions better than prior work. Additionally, we present analyses on a) the language of antisocial and prosocial posts, b) the relationship between antisocial or prosocial posts and user interactions, and c) the language of replies to hate speech that elicit follow-up conversations with different incivility levels. We show that forecasting the incivility level of conversations following a reply to hate speech is a challenging task. We also present qualitative analyses to identify the most common errors made by our best model.</description>

      <title>Supporting Gig Worker Needs and Advancing Policy Through Worker-Centered Data-Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferating adoption of platform-based gig work increasingly raises concerns for worker conditions. Past studies documented how platforms leveraged design to exploit labor, withheld information to generate power asymmetries, and left workers alone to manage logistical overheads as well as social isolation. However, researchers also called attention to the potential of helping workers overcome such costs via worker-led datasharing, which can enable collective actions and mutual aid among workers, while offering advocates, lawmakers and regulatory bodies insights for improving work conditions. To understand stakeholders' desiderata for a data-sharing system (i.e. functionality and policy initiatives that it can serve), we interviewed 11 policy domain experts in the U.S. and conducted co-design workshops with 14 active gig workers across four domains. Our results outline policymakers' prioritized initiatives, information needs, and (mis)alignments with workers' concerns and desires around data collectives. We offer design recommendations for data-sharing systems that support worker needs while bringing us closer to legislation that promote more thriving and equitable gig work futures.</description>

      <title>LLM-Mirror: A Generated-Persona Approach for Survey Pre-Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03162v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys are widely used in social sciences to understand human behavior, but their implementation often involves iterative adjustments that demand significant effort and resources. To this end, researchers have increasingly turned to large language models (LLMs) to simulate human behavior. While existing studies have focused on distributional similarities, individual-level comparisons remain underexplored. Building upon prior work, we investigate whether providing LLMs with respondents' prior information can replicate both statistical distributions and individual decision-making patterns using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), a well-established causal analysis method. We also introduce the concept of the LLM-Mirror, user personas generated by supplying respondent-specific information to the LLM. By comparing responses generated by the LLM-Mirror with actual individual survey responses, we assess its effectiveness in replicating individual-level outcomes. Our findings show that: (1) PLS-SEM analysis shows LLM-generated responses align with human responses, (2) LLMs, when provided with respondent-specific information, are capable of reproducing individual human responses, and (3) LLM-Mirror responses closely follow human responses at the individual level. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a complementary tool for pre-testing surveys and optimizing research design.</description>

      <title>DMP_AI: An AI-Aided K-12 System for Teaching and Learning in Diverse Schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained momentum in education. However, the use of AI in K-12 education is still in its nascent stages, and further research and development is needed to realize its potential. Moreover, the creation of a comprehensive and cohesive system that effectively harnesses AI to support teaching and learning across a diverse range of primary and secondary schools presents substantial challenges that need to be addressed. To fill these gaps, especially in countries like China, we designed and implemented the DMP_AI (Data Management Platform_Artificial Intelligence) system, an innovative AI-aided educational system specifically designed for K-12 education. The system utilizes data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning, along with learning analytics, to offer a wide range of features, including student academic performance and behavior prediction, early warning system, analytics of Individualized Education Plan, talented students prediction and identification, and cross-school personalized electives recommendation. The development of this system has been meticulously carried out while prioritizing user privacy and addressing the challenges posed by data heterogeneity. We successfully implemented the DMP_AI system in real-world primary and secondary schools, allowing us to gain valuable insights into the potential and challenges of integrating AI into K-12 education in the real world. This system will serve as a valuable resource for supporting educators in providing effective and inclusive K-12 education.</description>

      <title>Analyzing political stances on Twitter in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and amplifying political discourse, particularly during elections. However, the same dynamics that foster democratic engagement can also exacerbate polarization. To better understand these challenges, here, we investigate the ideological positioning of tweets related to the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election. To this end, we analyze 1,235 tweets from key political figures and 63,322 replies, and classify ideological stances into Pro-Democrat, Anti-Republican, Pro-Republican, Anti-Democrat, and Neutral categories. Using a classification pipeline involving three large language models (LLMs)-GPT-4o, Gemini-Pro, and Claude-Opus-and validated by human annotators, we explore how ideological alignment varies between candidates and constituents. We find that Republican candidates author significantly more tweets in criticism of the Democratic party and its candidates than vice versa, but this relationship does not hold for replies to candidate tweets. Furthermore, we highlight shifts in public discourse observed during key political events. By shedding light on the ideological dynamics of online political interactions, these results provide insights for policymakers and platforms seeking to address polarization and foster healthier political dialogue.</description>

      <title>Shaping AI's Impact on Billions of Lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI), like any transformative technology, has the potential to be a double-edged sword, leading either toward significant advancements or detrimental outcomes for society as a whole. As is often the case when it comes to widely-used technologies in market economies (e.g., cars and semiconductor chips), commercial interest tends to be the predominant guiding factor. The AI community is at risk of becoming polarized to either take a laissez-faire attitude toward AI development, or to call for government overregulation. Between these two poles we argue for the community of AI practitioners to consciously and proactively work for the common good. This paper offers a blueprint for a new type of innovation infrastructure including 18 concrete milestones to guide AI research in that direction. Our view is that we are still in the early days of practical AI, and focused efforts by practitioners, policymakers, and other stakeholders can still maximize the upsides of AI and minimize its downsides.
  We talked to luminaries such as recent Nobelist John Jumper on science, President Barack Obama on governance, former UN Ambassador and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice on security, philanthropist Eric Schmidt on several topics, and science fiction novelist Neal Stephenson on entertainment. This ongoing dialogue and collaborative effort has produced a comprehensive, realistic view of what the actual impact of AI could be, from a diverse assembly of thinkers with deep understanding of this technology and these domains. From these exchanges, five recurring guidelines emerged, which form the cornerstone of a framework for beginning to harness AI in service of the public good. They not only guide our efforts in discovery but also shape our approach to deploying this transformative technology responsibly and ethically.</description>

      <title>Advancing Conversational Psychotherapy: Integrating Privacy, Dual-Memory, and Domain Expertise with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mental health has increasingly become a global issue that reveals the limitations of traditional conversational psychotherapy, constrained by location, time, expense, and privacy concerns. In response to these challenges, we introduce SoulSpeak, a Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled chatbot designed to democratize access to psychotherapy. SoulSpeak improves upon the capabilities of standard LLM-enabled chatbots by incorporating a novel dual-memory component that combines short-term and long-term context via Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to offer personalized responses while ensuring the preservation of user privacy and intimacy through a dedicated privacy module. In addition, it leverages a counseling chat dataset of therapist-client interactions and various prompting techniques to align the generated responses with psychotherapeutic methods. We introduce two fine-tuned BERT models to evaluate the system against existing LLMs and human therapists: the Conversational Psychotherapy Preference Model (CPPM) to simulate human preference among responses and another to assess response relevance to user input. CPPM is useful for training and evaluating psychotherapy-focused language models independent from SoulSpeak, helping with the constrained resources available for psychotherapy. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the dual-memory component and the robustness of the privacy module are also examined. Our findings highlight the potential and challenge of enhancing mental health care by offering an alternative that combines the expertise of traditional therapy with the advantages of LLMs, providing a promising way to address the accessibility and personalization gap in current mental health services.</description>

      <title>Data Acquisition for Improving Model Fairness using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly being used in critical decision making such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. Concerns around their fairness have resulted in several bias mitigation techniques that emphasize the need for high-quality data to ensure fairer decisions. However, the role of earlier stages of machine learning pipelines in mitigating model bias has not been explored well. In this paper, we focus on the task of acquiring additional labeled data points for training the downstream machine learning model to rapidly improve its fairness. Since not all data points in a data pool are equally beneficial to the task of fairness, we generate an ordering in which data points should be acquired. We present DataSift, a data acquisition framework based on the idea of data valuation that relies on partitioning and multi-armed bandits to determine the most valuable data points to acquire. Over several iterations, DataSift selects a partition and randomly samples a batch of data points from the selected partition, evaluates the benefit of acquiring the batch on model fairness, and updates the utility of partitions depending on the benefit. To further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of evaluating batches, we leverage influence functions that estimate the effect of acquiring a batch without retraining the model. We empirically evaluate DataSift on several real-world and synthetic datasets and show that the fairness of a machine learning model can be significantly improved even while acquiring a few data points.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Behavior Simulation with Role-Playing Large Language Model on Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in role-playing tasks. However, there is limited research on whether LLMs can accurately simulate user behavior in real-world scenarios, such as social media. This requires models to effectively analyze a user's history and simulate their role. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{FineRob}, a novel fine-grained behavior simulation dataset. We collect the complete behavioral history of 1,866 distinct users across three social media platforms. Each behavior is decomposed into three fine-grained elements: object, type, and content, resulting in 78.6k QA records. Based on FineRob, we identify two dominant reasoning patterns in LLMs' behavior simulation processes and propose the \textbf{OM-CoT} fine-tuning method to enhance the capability. Through comprehensive experiments, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key factors of behavior simulation and also demonstrate the effectiveness of OM-CoT approach\footnote{Code and dataset are available at \url{https://github.com/linkseed18612254945/FineRob}}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional sociological research often relies on human participation, which, though effective, is expensive, challenging to scale, and with ethical concerns. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their potential to simulate human behavior, enabling the replication of individual responses and facilitating studies on many interdisciplinary studies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of this field, illustrating the recent progress in simulation driven by LLM-empowered agents. We categorize the simulations into three types: (1) Individual Simulation, which mimics specific individuals or demographic groups; (2) Scenario Simulation, where multiple agents collaborate to achieve goals within specific contexts; and (3) Society Simulation, which models interactions within agent societies to reflect the complexity and variety of real-world dynamics. These simulations follow a progression, ranging from detailed individual modeling to large-scale societal phenomena. We provide a detailed discussion of each simulation type, including the architecture or key components of the simulation, the classification of objectives or scenarios and the evaluation method. Afterward, we summarize commonly used datasets and benchmarks. Finally, we discuss the trends across these three types of simulation.

Abstract: This study confronts the growing challenges of energy consumption and the depletion of energy resources, particularly in the context of smart buildings. As the demand for energy increases alongside the necessity for efficient building maintenance, it becomes imperative to explore innovative energy management solutions. We present a comprehensive review of Internet of Things (IoT)-based frameworks aimed at smart city energy management, highlighting the pivotal role of IoT devices in addressing these issues due to their compactness, sensing, measurement, and computing capabilities. Our review methodology encompasses a thorough analysis of existing literature on IoT architectures and frameworks for intelligent energy management applications. We focus on systems that not only collect and store data but also support intelligent analysis for monitoring, controlling, and enhancing system efficiency. Additionally, we examine the potential for these frameworks to serve as platforms for the development of third-party applications, thereby extending their utility and adaptability. The findings from our review indicate that IoT-based frameworks offer significant potential to reduce energy consumption and environmental impact in smart buildings. Through the adoption of intelligent mechanisms and solutions, these frameworks facilitate effective energy management, leading to improved system efficiency and sustainability. Considering these findings, we recommend further exploration and adoption of IoT-based wireless sensing systems in smart buildings as a strategic approach to energy management. Our review underscores the importance of incorporating intelligent analysis and enabling the development of third-party applications within the IoT framework to efficiently meet the evolving energy demands and maintenance challenges</description>

      <title>Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.</description>

      <title>Breast Cancer Classification Using Gradient Boosting Algorithms Focusing on Reducing the False Negative and SHAP for Explainability</title>

Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41\% for all models.</description>

      <title>Controlling Counterfactual Harm in Decision Support Systems Based on Prediction Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decision support systems based on prediction sets help humans solve multiclass classification tasks by narrowing down the set of potential label values to a subset of them, namely a prediction set, and asking them to always predict label values from the prediction sets. While this type of systems have been proven to be effective at improving the average accuracy of the predictions made by humans, by restricting human agency, they may cause harm$\unicode{x2014}$a human who has succeeded at predicting the ground-truth label of an instance on their own may have failed had they used these systems. In this paper, our goal is to control how frequently a decision support system based on prediction sets may cause harm, by design. To this end, we start by characterizing the above notion of harm using the theoretical framework of structural causal models. Then, we show that, under a natural, albeit unverifiable, monotonicity assumption, we can estimate how frequently a system may cause harm using only predictions made by humans on their own. Further, we also show that, under a weaker monotonicity assumption, which can be verified experimentally, we can bound how frequently a system may cause harm again using only predictions made by humans on their own. Building upon these assumptions, we introduce a computational framework to design decision support systems based on prediction sets that are guaranteed to cause harm less frequently than a user-specified value using conformal risk control. We validate our framework using real human predictions from two different human subject studies and show that, in decision support systems based on prediction sets, there is a trade-off between accuracy and counterfactual harm.</description>

      <title>Scorecards for Synthetic Medical Data Evaluation and Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although interest in synthetic medical data (SMD) for training and testing AI methods is growing, the absence of a standardized framework to evaluate its quality and applicability hinders its wider adoption. Here, we outline an evaluation framework designed to meet the unique requirements of medical applications, and introduce SMD Card, which can serve as comprehensive reports that accompany artificially generated datasets. This card provides a transparent and standardized framework for evaluating and reporting the quality of synthetic data, which can benefit SMD developers, users, and regulators, particularly for AI models using SMD in regulatory submissions.</description>
