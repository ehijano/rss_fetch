      <title>Jordanian spin chains for twisted strings in $AdS_5\times S^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable spin chain formulation of Jordanian deformations of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, realised via Drinfel'd twists. Among these models, we first identify a unique supergravity deformation confined to an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ sector and with constant dilaton. We then develop a general framework for closed Drinfel'd twisted spin chains and construct an explicit map to undeformed models with twisted-boundary conditions. Applied to the non compact $\mathrm{XXX}_{-1/2}$ spin chain, the Jordanian twist breaks the Cartan generator labelling magnon excitations, obstructing the standard Bethe methods. Instead, using the twisted-boundary formulation, we initiate the spectral problem based on a residual root generator both in the thermodynamic limit and for short chains. We find that the ground state is non-trivially deformed, and is in agreement with the classical string result, while our analysis does not capture higher-spin excited states. We also study the asymptotics of the associated $Q$-system, which is well-behaved and compatible with the boundary-twist. While a full understanding of the spectrum remains open, our work provides concrete steps toward a spectral description of non-abelian twisted integrable models.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian Multiforms for ABS Equations II: Tetrahedron and Octahedron Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form associated to the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. These include the triangle Lagrangian that has traditionally been used in the Lagrangian multiform description of ABS equations, the trident Lagrangian that was central to Part I of this paper, and two Lagrangians that have not been studied in the multiform setting. Two of the Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations, and one produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the triangle Lagrangian 2-form, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations). We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian Multiforms for ABS Equations I: Quad Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational perspective on lattice equations that are integrable in the sense of multidimensional consistency. The Lagrangian multiforms for the equations of the ABS classification formed the start of this theory, but the Lagrangian multiforms that are usually considered in this context produce equations that are slightly weaker than the ABS equations. In this work, we present alternative Lagrangian multiforms that have Euler-Lagrange equations equivalent to the ABS equations. In addition, the treatment of the ABS Lagrangian multiforms in the existing literature fails to acknowledge that the complex functions in their definitions have branch cuts. The choice of branch affects both the existence of an additive three-leg form for the ABS equations and the closure property of the Lagrangian multiforms. We give counterexamples for both these properties, but we recover them by including integer-valued fields, related to the branch choices, in the action sums.</description>

      <title>Spherical and Planar Ball Bearings -- a Study of Integrable Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonholonomic systems of $n$ homogeneous balls $\mathbf B_1,\dots,\mathbf B_n$ with the same radius $r$ that are rolling without slipping about a fixed sphere $\mathbf S_0$ with center $O$ and radius $R$. In addition, it is assumed that a dynamically nonsymmetric sphere $\mathbf S$ with the center that coincides with the center $O$ of the fixed sphere $\mathbf S_0$ rolls without slipping in contact to the moving balls $\mathbf B_1,\dots,\mathbf B_n$. The problem is considered in four different configurations. We derive the equations of motion and prove that these systems possess an invariant measure. As the main result, for $n=1$ we found two cases that are integrable in quadratures according to the Euler-Jacobi theorem. The obtained integrable nonholonomic models are natural extensions of the well-known Chaplygin ball integrable problems. Further, we explicitly integrate the planar problem consisting of $n$ homogeneous balls of the same radius, but with different masses, that roll without slipping over a fixed plane $\Sigma_0$ with a plane $\Sigma$ that moves without slipping over these balls.</description>

      <title>Kondo overscreening in the presence of superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <title>Generalized Li\'enard systems and isochronous connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore some classical and quantum aspects of the nonlinear Li\'enard equation $\ddot{x} + k x \dot{x} + \omega^2 x + (k^2/9) x^3 = 0$, where $x=x(t)$ is a real variable and $k, \omega \in \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate that such an equation could be derived from an equation of the Levinson-Smith kind which is of the form $\ddot{z} + J(z) \dot{z}^2 + F(z) \dot{z} + G(z) = 0$, where $z=z(t)$ is a real variable and $\{J(z), F(z), G(z)\}$ are suitable functions to be specified. It can further be mapped to the harmonic oscillator by making use of a nonlocal transformation, establishing its isochronicity. Computations employing the Jacobi last multiplier reveal that the system exhibits a bi-Hamiltonian character, i.e., there are two distinct types of Hamiltonians describing the system. For each of these, we perform a canonical quantization in the momentum representation and explore the possibility of bound states. While one of the Hamiltonians is seen to exhibit an equispaced spectrum with an infinite tower of states, the other one exhibits branching but can be solved exactly in closed form for certain choices of the parameters.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a theory of hyperelliptic functions based on multidimensional sigma functions is developed and explicit formulas for hyperelliptic solutions to the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations KP-I and KP-II are obtained. The long-standing problem of describing the dependence of these solutions on the variation of the coefficients of the defining equation of a hyperelliptic curve, which are integrals of the equations, is solved.</description>
