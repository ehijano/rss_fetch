      <title>Particle manipulations based on acoustic valley topological rainbow defect-state trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic microfluidic is an important technology in particle manipulations in biomedical analyses and detections. However, the particle-movement manipulations achieved by the standing surface acoustic wave is suitable for particles in a thin layer of fluids, however it is difficult to manipulate particles in deeper solutions due to the energy loss of surface acoustic waves. The traditional standing bulk wave method can realize the particle manipulation in deep solutions, but it cannot work properly for particle manipulation within a long distance due to the energy loss. In this work, the topological rainbow defect-state trapping is realized, the results show that an effect of point accumulation of acoustic pressure in the waveguide path exists, the position of maximum acoustic pressure can be adjusted flexibly by changing the frequency of the incident acoustic wave, based on which, long-distance movement and capture manipulations of particles in deep solution have been realized. The phenomenon presented in this work can provide a reliable method for manipulations of continuous long-distance particle movement and capture to meet the demand of multiple processing steps in biochemical analyses and detections. The experiment verification results will be presented in the near future.</description>

      <title>A computational model for inelastic behaviour and fracture of refractory industrial components under high-temperature conditions, application to slide gate plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to provide a computational model that can describe the complex behaviour of refractory industrial components under working conditions. Special attention is given to the asymmetric tension-compression behaviour and its evolution in the full range of working temperatures. The model accounts for inelastic flow in compression and brittle fracture behaviour in tension by leveraging the continuum-mechanics theory of plasticity and phase-field fracture damage. The model is implemented in the Finite Element open-source platform FEniCS and is used to analyze the fracture phenomenon in the refractory plate used in ladle slide gate systems to control the liquid steel flow from the ladle to the tundish.</description>

      <title>Contribution of soundscape appropriateness to soundscape quality assessment in space: a mediating variable affecting acoustic comfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soundscape appropriateness (SA) provides supplemental information on the matching degree between auditory information and the surrounding scene in soundscape perception. This indicator has been integrated into the standard ISO process for collecting soundscape data, forming a component of the sound quality assessment questionnaire. However, its role in soundscape quality assessment has not been fully understood. Herein, we present the findings from soundscape data collected from Beiling Park in Shenyang, China. A method was developed that integrates mediation effect models with multiscale geographically weighted regression models to explore the mediating role of SA in the impact of sound source types on soundscape quality, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of this mediation effect. The results confirm that SA does mediates the influence of sound source types on acoustics comfort (AC). Specifically, natural sounds (indirect effect/total effect = .19/.19), traffic sounds (indirect effect/total effect = -.46/-.65), and commercial sounds (indirect effect/total effect = -.25/-.12) impact the perception of AC by either enhancing or reducing SA. Moreover, the relationships among variables depicted in this model demonstrate spatial heterogeneity, demonstrating that in urban open spaces with complex constructures, local spatial models may be needed for soundscape assessment. The research reaffirms the significance of SA in urban open spaces. In terms of practical implications for urban and landscape planners, when sound sources cannot be controlled or altered, coordinating between the sound and the surrounding environment through landscape optimisation could also improve the quality of the soundscape through enhancing SA and help achieve the goal of creating healthy urban open spaces.</description>
