      <title>Improving student understanding of quantum measurement in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space using a research-based multiple-choice question sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research-based multiple-choice questions implemented in class with peer instruction have been shown to be an effective tool for improving students' engagement and learning outcomes. Moreover, multiple-choice questions that are carefully sequenced to build on each other can be particularly helpful for students to develop a systematic understanding of concepts pertaining to a theme. Here, we discuss the development, validation, and implementation of a multiple-choice question sequence (MQS) on the topic of quantum measurement in the context of wave functions in the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. This MQS was developed using students' common difficulties with quantum measurements as a guide and was implemented in a junior-/senior-level quantum mechanics course at a large research university in the U.S. We compare student performance on assessment tasks focusing on quantum measurement before and after the implementation of the MQS and discuss how different difficulties were reduced and how to further improve students' conceptual understanding of quantum measurement in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Hands-on Experiment Supported by Augmented Reality Smartglasses for Learning the Lorentz Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that inquiry-based learning through hands-on experiments, as well as learning with multiple, external representations (MERs) can promote the understanding of complex phenomena in physics. In this context, augmented reality (AR) smartglasses make it possible to superimpose real experiments with virtually presented information while maintaining learners' freedom to interact with the experimental setup. This allows spatial and temporal contiguity to be established between the phenomenon and the supporting virtual visualizations which can help to reduce learners' cognitive load and to free up cognitive resources for learning. We introduce an AR learning environment for the investigation of the Lorentz force. By visualizing the fields relevant to the experiment in AR, a more direct investigation of the physical phenomenon can be achieved for the learner. Additionally, this setup can foster the acquisition of representational skills by providing the possibility to superimpose fields using various representations. This learning setting will be used in future studies to investigate how MERs should be combined in a guided inquiry-based learning environment to best promote learners' conceptual knowledge and representational skills. We present the system and report usability data that were collected from a sample of 188 secondary school students. The average score was 80.18 (SD: 12.06) which signals an excellent usability of the AR learning environment.</description>

      <title>Student performance analysis of virtual introductory calculus-based physics class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.01809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Student performance of virtual introductory physics class (calculus-based mechanics) is analyzed. A fully web-enhanced class was done synchronously. The analysis is done in two categories, averaging all mid-exams (or chapter exams) and cumulative final exams. It shows that students perform well with shorter timed mid-semester assessments (or chapter exams) than the longer timed assessments. Results were then compared with two survey questions to investigate the effect of the background knowledge of physics and calculus on their performance. It shows two interesting results, a) students with basic conceptual background knowledge of physics perform well, b) calculus knowledge does not correlate well with student performance. These findings can be used to rethink and redesign the assessments for calculus-based introductory physics classes. Also, the findings can be used to develop a supplemental support program to enhance student performance.</description>

      <title>Presenting a STEM Ways of Thinking Framework for Engineering Design-based Physics Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating students' thinking in classroom tasks, particularly in science and engineering, is essential for improving educational practices and advancing student learning. In this context, the notion of Ways of Thinking (WoT) has gained traction in STEM education, offering a framework to explore how students approach and solve interdisciplinary problems. Building on our earlier studies and contributing to ongoing discussions on WoT frameworks, this paper introduces a new WoT framework: Ways of Thinking in Engineering Design based Physics (WoT4EDP). WoT4EDP integrates five key elements: design, science, mathematics, metacognitive reflection, and computational thinking within an undergraduate introductory physics laboratory. This framework offers a novel perspective by emphasizing how these interconnected elements work together to foster deeper learning and holistic problem-solving in Engineering Design based projects. A key takeaway is that this framework serves as a practical tool for educators and researchers to design, implement, and analyze interdisciplinary STEM activities in physics classrooms. We describe the development of WoT4EDP, situate it within the broader landscape of undergraduate STEM education, and provide detailed characterizations of its components. Additionally, we compare WoT4EDP with two contemporary frameworks: Dalal et al. (2021) and English (2023), to glean insights that enhance its application and promote interdisciplinary thinking. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In the upcoming second part, we will demonstrate the application of the WoT4EDP framework, showcasing how it can be used to analyze student thinking in real-world, ED-based physics projects.</description>

      <title>How much time do we have before catastrophic disclosure occurs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Claims of the retrieval of crashed craft or vehicles from non-human intelligence(s) (NHI) abound in the popular culture and media. For this article, the number of unsubstantiated claims is utilized to estimate the time expected until a "catastrophic disclosure" occurs. The term was defined at the 2023 Sol Foundation's inaugural conference as an accidental disclosure of strong evidence of the existence of NHI. The phrase refers to this occurring outside the control of major human institutions, such as governments and militaries. One possible example of this is the crash of a piloted (space)craft or ET probe in the middle of a busy metropolis (such as the New York City Times Square). The distribution of humans across the Earth's surface, the population as a function of time, and the fraction of individuals owning a camera-phone, also versus time, are each taken into consideration as a foundation for a rigorous statistical analysis. This author adopts a skeptical and agnostic approach and does not conclude NHI or ET are real, but applies standard statistical distributions as educational examples of critical thinking to an issue which captures the imagination of the public as almost no other issue does. Making the extraordinary assumptions that sentient species other than humans exist, are capable of constructing vehicles for transportation, and are sufficiently fallible that their technology can malfunction, it becomes possible to quantify some potential answers to the question of how long it might be before smartphone imagery and/or video evidence appears on the web and becomes irrevocable via classification in the modern era. Results of simulations of numerous potential scenarios with varying degrees of optimism indicate that, if NHI are real, catastrophic disclosure may actually happen accidentally rather soon, with the mean expected year being 2040 +/- 20 under the default assumptions.</description>
