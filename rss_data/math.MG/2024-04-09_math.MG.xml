      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff distances from simply connected geodesic spaces to the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance from the circle with its geodesic metric to any simply connected geodesic space is never smaller than $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We also prove that this bound is tight through the construction of a simply connected geodesic space $\mathrm{E}$ which attains the lower bound $\frac{\pi}{4}$. We deduce the first statement from a general result that we also establish which gives conditions on how small the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two geodesic metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y )$ has to be in order for $\pi_1(X)$ and $\pi_1(Y)$ to be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Kakeya problem and projection problem for $k$-geodesics in Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kakeya problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is about estimating the size of union of $k$-planes; the projection problem in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is about estimating the size of projection of a set onto every $k$-plane ($1\le k\le n-1$). The $k=1$ case has been studied on general manifolds in which $1$-planes become geodesics, while $k\ge 2$ cases were still only considered in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We formulate these problems on homogeneous spaces, where $k$-planes are replaced by $k$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifolds. After formulating the problem, we prove a sharp estimate for Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of tiling the plane with a fixed number of Wang bars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study the fixed parameter undecidability of tiling problem for a set of Wang tiles, Jeandel and Rolin show that the tiling problem for a set of 44 Wang bars is undecidable. In this paper, we improve their result by proving that whether a set of 29 Wang bars can tile the plane is undecidable. As a consequence, the tiling problem for a set of Wang tiles with color deficiency of 25 is also undecidable.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>The Michor-Mumford conjecture in Hilbertian H-type groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce infinite dimensional Hilbertian H-type groups equipped with weak, graded, left invariant Riemannian metrics. For these Lie groups, we show that the vanishing of the geodesic distance and the local unboundedness of the sectional curvature coexist. The result validates a deep phenomenon conjectured in an influential 2005 paper by Michor and Mumford, namely, the vanishing of the geodesic distance is linked to the local unboundedness of the sectional curvature. We prove that degenerate geodesic distances appear for a large class of weak, left invariant Riemannian metrics. Their vanishing is rather surprisingly related to the infinite dimensional sub-Riemannian structure of Hilbertian H-type groups. The same class of weak Riemannian metrics yields the nonexistence of the Levi-Civita covariant derivative.</description>

      <title>Super Guarding and Dark Rays in Art Galleries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore an Art Gallery variant where each point of a polygon must be seen by k guards, and guards cannot see through other guards. Surprisingly, even covering convex polygons under this variant is not straightforward. For example, covering every point in a triangle k=4 times (a 4-cover) requires 5 guards, and achieving a 10-cover requires 12 guards. Our main result is tight bounds on k-covering a convex polygon of n vertices, for all k and n. The proofs of both upper and lower bounds are nontrivial. We also obtain bounds for simple polygons, leaving tight bounds an open problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a version of Lagrangian Floer homology whose chain complex is generated by the inscriptions of a rectangle into a real analytic Jordan curve. By using its associated spectral invariants, we establish that a rectifiable Jordan curve admits inscriptions of a whole interval of rectangles. In particular, it inscribes a square if the area it encloses is more than half that of a circle of equal diameter.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of the Tetrahedron and Cube: An Exploration of Shortest Paths on Polyhedra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.04253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of determining the length of the shortest paths between points on the surfaces of tetrahedra and cubes. Our approach parallels the concept of Alexandrov's star unfolding but focuses on specific polyhedra and uses their symmetries to develop coordinate based formulae. We do so by defining a coordinate system on the surfaces of these polyhedra. Subsequently, we identify relevant regions within each polyhedron's nets and develop formulae which take as inputs the coordinates of the points and produce as an output the distance between the two points on the polyhedron being discussed.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetries between metric spaces and rough quasi-isometries between their infinite hyperbolic cones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.15020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first prove that any power quasi-symmetry of two metric spaces induces a rough quasi-isometry between their infinite hyperbolic cones. Second, we prove that for a complete metric space $Z$, there exists a point $\omega$ in the Gromov boundary of its infinite hyperbolic cone such that $Z$ can be seen as the Gromov boundary relative to $\omega$ of its infinite hyperbolic cone. Third, we prove that for a visual Gromov hyperbolic metric space $X$ and a Gromov boundary point $\omega$, $X$ is roughly similar to the infinite hyperbolic cone of its Gromov boundary relative to $\omega$. These are the generalizations of Theorem 7.4, Theorem 8.1 and Theorem 8.2 in [3] since the underlying spaces are not assumed to be bounded and the hyperbolic cones are infinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hyperplane $H$ supporting a convex body $C$ in the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^d$ we define the width of $C$ determined by $H$ as the distance between $H$ and a most distant ultraparallel hyperplane supporting $C$. The minimum width of $C$ over all supporting $H$ is called the thickness $\Delta (C)$ of $C$. A convex body $R \subset \mathbb{H}^d$ is said to be reduced if $\Delta (Z) &lt; \Delta (R)$ for every convex body $Z$ properly contained in $R$. We describe a class of reduced polygons in $\mathbb{H}^2$ and present some properties of them. In particular, we estimate their diameters in terms of their thicknesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2005.13598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with configurations of points in a plane lattice which determine angles that are rational multiples of $\pi$. We shall study how many such angles may appear in a given lattice and in which positions, allowing the lattice to vary arbitrarily. This classification turns out to be much less simple than could be expected, leading even to parametrizations involving rational points on certain algebraic curves of positive genus.Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in the theory of metric measures spaces on the one hand, and of sub-Riemannian ones on the other hand, suggest the possibility of a "great unification" of Riemannian and sub-Riemannian geometries in a comprehensive framework of synthetic Ricci curvature lower bounds. With the aim of achieving such a unification program, in this paper we initiate the study of gauge metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>A new notion of subharmonicity on locally smoothing spaces, and a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a strongly local Dirichlet space and $\lambda\geq 0$, we introduce a new notion of $\lambda$--subharmonicity for $L^1_\loc$--functions, which we call \emph{local $\lambda$--shift defectivity}, and which turns out to be equivalent to distributional $\lambda$--subharmonicity in the Riemannian case. We study the regularity of these functions on a new class of strongly local Dirichlet, so called locally smoothing spaces, which includes Riemannian manifolds (without any curvature assumptions), finite dimensional RCD spaces, Carnot groups, and Sierpinski gaskets. As a byproduct of this regularity theory, we obtain in this general framework a proof of a conjecture by Braverman, Milatovic, Shubin on the positivity of distributional $L^q$-solutions of $\Delta f\leq f$ for complete Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sub-25-dimensional counterexamples to Borsuk's conjecture in the Leech lattice?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06283v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1933, Karol Borsuk asked whether each bounded set in the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space can be divided into $n$+1 parts of smaller diameter. Because it would not make sense otherwise, one usually assumes that he just forgot to require that the whole set contains at least two points. The hypothesis that the answer to that question is positive became famous under the name \emph{Borsuk's conjecture}. Counterexamples are known for any $n\ge 64$, since 2013.
  Let $\Lambda$ be the (original, unscaled) Leech lattice, a now very well-known infinite discrete vector set in the 24-dimensional Euclidean space. The smallest norm of nonzero vectors in $\Lambda$ is $\sqrt{32}$. Let $M$ be the set of the 196560 vectors in $\Lambda$ having this norm.
  For each $x \in M$, $-x$ is in $M$. Let $H$ be the set of all subsets of $M$ that for each $x$ in $M$ contain either $x$ or $-x$. Each element of $H$ has the same diameter $d = \sqrt{96}$. For dimensions $n&lt;24$ one can analogously construct respective $M_n$ and $H_n$ from laminated $n$-dimensional sublattices $\Lambda_n$ of $\Lambda$. For uniformity, let $\Lambda_{24}=\Lambda$, $M_{24} = M$ and $H_{24} = H$.
  If $M_n$ is divisible into at most $n+1$ parts of diameter below $d$ then this applies to all elements of $H_n$, too. I have checked that this is the case for all $n \le 21$. For $n$ from 22 to 24, the minimum number of parts of diameter below $d$ that I was able to divide $M_n$ into are 25, 29 and 35, resp. The source package of this article contains a data file encoding an element of $H_{24}=H$ that I can not divide into less than 30 parts of smaller diameter.</description>

Abstract: We consider some integral-geometric quantities that have recently arisen in harmonic analysis and elsewhere, derive some sharp geometric inequalities relating them, and place them in a wider context.</description>
