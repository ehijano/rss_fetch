      <title>Global Gauge Symmetries and Spatial Asymptotic Boundary Conditions in Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Yang-Mills gauge theory on a Euclidean Cauchy surface the group of gauge symmetries carrying direct empirical significance is often believed to be $\mathcal{G}_\text{DES}=\mathcal{G}^I/\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$, where $\mathcal{G}^I$ is the group of boundary-preserving gauge symmetries and $\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$ is its subgroup of transformations that are generated by the constraints of the theory. These groups are identified respectively as the gauge transformations that become constant asymptotically and those that become the identity asymptotically. In the Abelian case $G=U(1)$ the quotient is then identified as the group of global gauge symmetries, i.e. $U(1)$ itself. However, known derivations of this claim are imprecise, both mathematically and conceptually. We derive the physical gauge group rigorously for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory. Our main new point is that the requirement to restrict to $\mathcal{G}^I$ does not follow from finiteness of energy only, but from the requirement that the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory be defined on a tangent bundle to configuration space. Moreover, we explain why the quotient consists precisely of a copy of the global gauge group for every homotopy class, even if the various gauge transformations apparently have different asymptotic rates of convergence. Lastly, we consider Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in our framework and show that asymptotic boundary conditions differ in the unbroken and broken phases.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic construction of the $\mathbb{H}^3$-Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory and correspondence with Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models are among the most basic and most studied Conformal Field Theories (CFT). They have had a huge influence not only in physics but also in mathematics, in representation theory and geometry. However their rigorous probabilistic construction and analysis starting from the path integral is still missing and all their properties have been obtained algebraically from their postulated affine Lie algebra symmetry. Initially considered as taking values in a compact semisimple Lie Group G, the WZW model also has a "dual" formulation where the group $G$ is replaced by the homogenous space $G^{\mathbb{C}}/G$, where $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ is the complexification of $G$, and it has been argued that the former can be (re-)constructed from the latter. For $G={\rm SU}(2)$, the space ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/{\rm SU}(2)$ can be identified with the three dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ and, in physics, the corresponding CFT has been studied as the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A surprising correspondence between the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW CFT and the Liouville CFT was found by Ribault and Teschner and later generalised by Hikida and Shomerus. This correspondence has been dubbed by Gaiotto-Teschner as the "quantum analytic Langlands correspondence" since the analytic Langlands correspondence of Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan seems to emerge in its formal semi classical limit. In this paper we give a rigorous construction of the path integral for the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW model on a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$, twisted by an arbitrary smooth gauge field on $\Sigma$. Using the probabilistic path integral we prove a correspondence between the correlation functions of the primary fields of the $\mathbb{H}^3$ model and those of Liouville CFT extending the expressions proposed by Ribault-Teschner and by Hikida-Schomerus to this general setup.</description>

      <title>Equidistant versus bipartite ground states for 1D classical fluids at fixed particle density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground-state properties of one-dimensional fluids of classical (i.e., non-quantum) particles interacting pairwisely via a potential, at the fixed particle density $\rho$. Restricting ourselves to periodic configurations of particles, two possibilities are considered: an equidistant chain of particles with the uniform spacing $A=1/\rho$ and its simplest non-Bravais modulation, namely a bipartite lattice composed of two equidistant chains, shifted with respect to one another. Assuming the long range of the interaction potential, the equidistant chain dominates if $A$ is small enough, $0&lt;A&lt;A_c$. At a critical value of $A=A_c$, the system undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition from the equidistant chain to a bipartite lattice. The energy and the order parameter are singular functions of the deviation from the critical point $A-A_c$ with universal (i.e., independent of the model's parameters) mean-field values of critical exponents. The tricritical point at which the curve of continuous second-order transitions meets with the one of discontinuous first-order transitions is determined. The general theory is applied to the Lennard-Jones model with the $(n,m)$ Mie potential for which the phase diagram is constructed. The inclusion of a hard core around each particle reveals a non-universal critical phenomenon with an $m$-dependent critical exponent.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems related to electrical networks and the geometry of non-negative Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a new solution of the classical black box problem (the discrete Calderon problem) in the theory of circular electrical networks. Our approach is based on the explicit embedding of electrical networks into non-negative Grassmannians and generalized chamber ansatz for it. Additionally, we reveal the relationship of this problem with combinatorial properties of spanning groves and the theory of the totally non-negative matrices.
  Key words: electrical networks, discrete Calderon problem, discrete electrical impedance tomography, non-negative Grassmannians, twist for positroid variety, Temperley trick, totally non-negative matrices, effective resistances.</description>

      <title>A Variational Principle for Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics: Heat Conducting Viscous Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended irreversible thermodynamics is a theory that extends the classical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics by going beyond the local-equilibrium assumption. A notable example of this is the Maxwell-Cattaneo heat flux model, which introduces a time lag in the heat flux response to temperature gradients. In this paper, we develop a variational formulation of the equations of extended irreversible thermodynamics by introducing an action principle for a nonequilibrium Lagrangian that treats thermodynamic fluxes as independent variables. A key feature of this approach is that it naturally extends both Hamilton's principle of reversible continuum mechanics and the earlier variational formulation of classical irreversible thermodynamics. The variational principle is initially formulated in the material (Lagrangian) description, from which the Eulerian form is derived using material covariance (or relabeling symmetries). The tensorial structure of the thermodynamic fluxes dictates the choice of objective rate in the Eulerian description, leading to the introduction of nonequilibrium stresses arising from both viscous and thermal effects to ensure thermodynamic consistency. This framework naturally results in the Cattaneo-Christov model for heat flux. We also investigate the extension of the approach to accommodate higher-order fluxes and the general form of entropy fluxes. The variational framework presented in this paper has promising applications in the development of structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical methods. It is particularly relevant for modeling systems where entropy production is a delicate issue that requires careful treatment to ensure consistency with the laws of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-Hamiltonian structures can be utilised to compute a maximal set of functions in involution for certain integrable systems, given by the eigenvalues of the recursion operator relating both Poisson structures. We show that the recursion operator relating two compatible Jacobi structures cannot produce a maximal set of functions in involution. However, as we illustrate with an example, bi-Hamiltonian structures can still be used to obtain a maximal set of functions in involution on a contact manifold, at the cost of symplectisation.</description>

      <title>Tunneling between magnetic wells in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional magnetic Laplacian is considered. We calculate the leading term of the splitting between the first two eigenvalues of the operator in the semiclassical limit under the assumption that the magnetic field does not vanish and has two symmetric magnetic wells with respect to the coordinate axes. This is the first result of quantum tunneling between purely magnetic wells under generic assumptions. The proof, which strongly relies on microlocal analysis, reveals a purely magnetic Agmon distance between the wells. Surprisingly, it is discovered that the exponential decay of the eigenfunctions away from the magnetic wells is not crucial to derive the tunneling formula. The key is a microlocal exponential decay inside the characteristic manifold, with respect to the variable quantizing the classical center guide motion.</description>

      <title>Statistical density of particles in one dimensional interaction and Jellium Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $n$ charged particles confined by a potential and interacting through the Riesz potential or a more general potential. In equilibrium, and for symmetric potential the particles arrange themselves symmetrically around the origin within a finite region. Various models will be studied by modifying both the confining potential and the interaction potential. Focusing on the statistical properties of the system, we analyze the position of the rightmost particle, $x_{\text{max}}$, and show that its typical fluctuations are described by a limiting distribution different from the Tracy-Widom distribution found in the one-dimensional log-gas. We also derive the large deviation functions governing the atypical fluctuations of $x_{\text{max}}$ far from its mean.</description>

      <title>Sharp Estimates for Large N Weingarten Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weingarten functions provide a tool for computing Haar measure matrix integrals of polynomials in the matrix entries. An important property of Weingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017 Benoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten functions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \to \infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$ limit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already has applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not optimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to $n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)\}$. The proof proceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we call the unitary (orthogonal) \textit{Weingarten process}. We believe this process may have further applications to the theory of Weingarten functions. We also prove two new bounds regarding the large $N$ limit of the Weingarten function in the regimes when $n=o(N^{4/5})$, and $n=o(N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ref. 1 asked whether deleting gates from a random quantum circuit architecture can ever make the architecture a better approximate $t$-design. We show that it can. In particular, we construct a family of architectures such that the approximate $2$-design depth decreases when certain gates are deleted. We also give some intuition for this construction and discuss the relevance of this result to the approximate $t$-design depth of the 1D brickwork. Deleting gates always decreases scrambledness in the short run, but can sometimes cause it to increase in the long run. Finally, we give analogous results for spectral gaps and when deleting edges of interaction graphs.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies III: Gravity, Generalized Inhomogeneous Quasi-linear PDEs, Mode Conversion, and Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the $\beta \ll 1$ or $\beta \gg 1$ regimes. In a series of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to inhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity, and provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This paper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation, and is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the method.</description>

Abstract: Benford's Law is an important instance of experimental mathematics that appears to constrain the information-theoretic behavior of numbers. Elias' encoding for integers is a remarkable approach to universality and optimality of codes. In the present analysis we seek to deduce a general law and its particular implications for these two cases from optimality and renormalization as applied to information-theoretical functionals. Both theoretical and experimental results corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Existence theorem on the UV limit of Wilsonian RG flows of Feynman measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In nonperturbative formulation of Euclidean signature quantum field theory (QFT), the vacuum state is characterized by the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) flow of Feynman measures. Such an RG flow is a family of Feynman measures on the space of ultraviolet (UV) regularized fields, linked by the Wilsonian renormalization group equation. In this paper we show that under mild conditions, a Wilsonian RG flow of Feynman measures extending to arbitrary regularization strenghts has a factorization property: there exists an ultimate Feynman measure (UV limit) on the distribution sense fields, such that the regularized instances in the flow are obtained from this UV limit via taking the marginal measure against the regulator. Existence theorems about the flow and UV limit of the corresponding action functional are also proved.</description>

Abstract: Four new integrable evolutions equations with operator Lax pairs are found for an octonion variable. The method uses a scaling ansatz to set up a general polynomial form for the evolution equation and the Lax pair, using KdV and mKdV scaling weights. A condition for linear differential operators to be a Lax pair over octonions is formulated and solved for the unknown coefficients in the polynomials.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the defocusing local-and-nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with non-zero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the Riemann-Hilbert method, the theory of inverse scattering transform is developed for the defocusing local-and-nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (which originates from the parity-symmetric reduction of the Manakov system) with non-zero boundary conditions. First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed rigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the reverse-space nonlocality introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on eigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the inverse problem, and the reconstruction formulas are derived by considering arbitrary simple zeros of scattering coefficients. In the reflectionless case, the N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic analysis, the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton.</description>

      <title>Anderson localized states for the nonlinear Maryland model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Anderson localization for a nonlinear perturbation of the Maryland model $H=\varepsilon\Delta+\cot\pi(\theta+j\cdot\alpha)\delta_{j,j'}$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Specifically, if $\varepsilon,\delta$ are sufficiently small, we construct a large number of time quasi-periodic and space exponentially decaying solutions (i.e., Anderson localized states) for the equation $i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=Hu+\delta|u|^{2p}u$ with a Diophantine $\alpha$. Our proof combines eigenvalue estimates of the Maryland model with the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain method, which originates from KAM theory for Hamiltonian PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from an elementary calculation of super Lie group elements associating with non(anti)-commutative Grassmann parameters, we derive several closed expressions of Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula which represent multiplication properties of super Lie group elements in the corresponding superspace. We then show that parametrization of superspace in general may become infinite dimensional due to the presence of non(anti)commutativity. We show that a Dirac-K\"ahler Twisted SUSY Algebra (also referred to as Marcus B-type Twisted SUSY Algebra or Geometric Langlands Twisted SUSY Algebra) with a certain type of deformation, which we call an exponential deformation, may circumvent this problem. We also provide, in terms of gauge covariantization of the SUSY algebra, a geometric understanding of the exponential deformation, and see that the framework constructed in this paper may serve as a non(anti)commutative superspace framework providing the gauge covariant link formulation of twisted super Yang-Mills on a lattice.</description>

      <title>2-Adic quantum mechanics, continuous-time quantum walks, and the space discreteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques of p-adic analysis, it is possible to formulate a rigorous version of the quantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, consistent with the existence of the Planck length. Such a model cannot be formulated if we use R^{3} as a model for physical space. The experimental testability of physical theories at the Planck scale is currently impossible. Here, we provide an indirect, theoretical argument that shows that the p-adic QM has physical content. We show that a large class of Schr\"odinger equations describes the scaling limits of continuous-time quantum walks on graphs (stochastic automata). These quantum walks appear as fundamental tools in quantum computing. We conjecture that this interpretation is valid in a general framework. The `new theory' does not have Lorentz symmetry, and the Einstein causality is violated. This fact does not contradict the so-called no-communication theorem; such a result requires as a primary hypothesis that R^{4} be a valid model for space-time at the Planck scale. Thus, the no-communication theorem under the discreteness of the space is an open problem.</description>

      <title>On a family of Poisson brackets on gl(n) compatible with the Sklyanin bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a family of compatible quadratic Poisson brackets on gl(n), generalizing the Sklyanin one. For any of the brackets in the family, the argument shift determines the compatible linear bracket. The main interest for us is the use of the bi-Hamiltonian formalism for some pencils from this family, as a method for constructing involutive subalgebras for a linear bracket starting by the center of the quadratic bracket. We give some interesting examples of families of this type.
  We construct the centers of the corresponding quadratic brackets using the antidiagonal principal minors of the Lax matrix. Special attention should be paid to the condition of the log-canonicity of the brackets of these minors with all the generators of the Poisson algebra of the family under consideration. A similar property arises in the context of Poisson structures consistent with cluster transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or Wigner $3j$ symbols are known to be proportional to a $_3F_2(1)$ hypergeometric series, and Racah $6j$ coefficients to a $_4F_3(1)$. In general, however, non-trivial $9j$ symbols can not be expressed as a $_5F_4$. In this letter, we show, using the Dougall-Ramanujan identity, that special stretched $9j$ symbols can be reformulated as $_5F_4(1)$ hypergeometric series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the action of local conformal transformations on several measures related to the Gaussian free field and Schramm--Loewner evolutions. The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure ($\kappa\in(0,4]$); its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map, which we relate to the "$bc$-ghost system" from bosonic string theory. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformal welding of quantum surfaces.</description>

      <title>Peakons and pseudo-peakons of higher order b-family equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The peakon equations have garnered significant attention due to their rich mathematical structure and potential applications in various physical contexts. In this study, we extend the well-known b-family system, $m_t+m_xv+bv_xm=0,\quad m=(1-\partial_x^2)v,$ to a more general higher-order one with $m=(1-\partial_x^2)^Jv$ for an arbitrary positive integer $J$. We conjecture the existence of a b-independent pseudo-peakon solution of the form, $v=c\left(1+\left|x-ct\right|+\sum_{i=1}^{J-2}a_i\left|x-ct\right|^{i+1}\right)\mbox{\rm e}^{-\left|x-ct\right|}$ which includes $J-1$ arbitrary constants $a_1,\ a_2,\ \cdots,\ a_{J-1}$ for all $J\geq 2$. In additional to the b-independent psudo-peakon solution, we conclude that there are one b-independent peakon, one b-dependent peakon (for odd J) or two b-dependent peakons (for even J), and $J-3$ (for odd J) or $J-4$ (for even J) complex peakons. This comprehensive analysis provides deeper insights into the structure and behavior of peakons and pseudo-peakons within the extended b-family framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the time-dependent relationship between the mean and variance of travel time on a single corridor under rush hour like congestion patterns. To model this phenomenon, we apply the LWR ((Lighthill &amp; Whitham, 1955), (Richards, 1956)) theory on a homogenous freeway with a discontinuous bottleneck at its downstream end, assuming a uni-modal demand profile with a stochastic peak. We establish conditions for typical counterclockwise hysteresis loops under these assumptions. It is demonstrated that shapes of the fundamental diagram which always produce a counterclockwise loop can be interpreted as an indication of aggressive driving behavior, while deviations may occur under defensive driving. This classification enables a detailed explanation of the qualitative physical mechanisms behind this pattern, as well as an analysis of the causes for quantitatively limited deviations. Some of the mathematical properties of the LWR model identified in our analysis have not yet been addressed in the literature and we critically examine the extent to which these reflect actual traffic flow behavior. Our considerations are supported by numerical experiments. The obtained results aim to improve the fundamental understanding of the physical causes of this hysteresis pattern and to facilitate its better estimation in traffic planning and control.</description>

      <title>Singular diffusion limit of a tagged particle in zero range processes with Sinai-type random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a singular diffusion limit for the position of a tagged particle in zero range interacting particle processes on a one dimensional torus with a Sinai-type random environment via two steps. In the first step, a regularization is introduced by averaging the random environment over an $\varepsilon N$-neighborhood. With respect to such an environment, the microscopic drift of the tagged particle is in form $\frac{1}{N}W_\varepsilon'$, where $W_\varepsilon'$ is a regularized White noise. Scaling diffusively, we find the nonequilibrium limit of the tagged particle $x^\varepsilon_t$ is the unique weak solution of $d x_t^{\varepsilon} = 2\frac{\Phi(\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^{\varepsilon}))}{\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^\varepsilon)} \,W_{\varepsilon}'(x_t^\varepsilon) + \sqrt{\frac{\Phi(\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^\varepsilon))}{\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^\varepsilon)}} \,dB_t$, in terms of the hydrodynamic mass density $\rho^\varepsilon$ recently identified and homogenized interaction rate $\Phi$.
  In the second step, we show that $x^\varepsilon$, as $\varepsilon$ vanishes, converges in law to the diffusion $x^0$ described informally by $d x_t^0 = 2\frac{\Phi(\rho^{0}(t, x_t^{0}))}{\rho^{0}(t, x_t^0)} \,W'(x_t^0) + \sqrt{\frac{\Phi(\rho^{0}(t, x_t^0))}{\rho^{0}(t, x_t^0)}} \,dB_t$, where $W'$ is a spatial White noise and $\rho^0$ is the para-controlled limit of $\rho^\varepsilon$ also recently identified, solving the singular PDE $ \partial_t \rho^0 = \frac{1}{2}\Delta \Phi(\rho^0) - 2\nabla \big(W' \Phi(\rho^0)\big)$.</description>

      <title>Invariance principle for the Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos via a high dimensional CLT with low rank increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) is a canonical random fractal measure obtained by exponentiating log-correlated Gaussian processes, first constructed in the seminal work of Kahane (1985). Since then it has served as an important building block in constructions of quantum field theories and Liouville quantum gravity. However, in many natural settings, non-Gaussian log-correlated processes arise. In this paper, we investigate the universality of GMC through an invariance principle. We consider the model of a random Fourier series, a process known to be log-correlated. While the Gaussian Fourier series has been a classical object of study, recently, the non-Gaussian counterpart was investigated and the associated multiplicative chaos constructed by Junnila in 2016. We show that the Gaussian and non-Gaussian variables can be coupled so that the associated chaos measures are almost surely mutually absolutely continuous throughout the entire sub-critical regime. This solves the main open problem from Kim and Kriechbaum (2024) who had earlier established such a result for a part of the regime. The main ingredient is a new high dimensional CLT for a sum of independent (but not i.i.d.) random vectors belonging to rank one subspaces with error bounds involving the isotropic properties of the covariance matrix of the sum, which we expect will find other applications. The proof relies on a path-wise analysis of Skorokhod embeddings as well as a perturbative result about square roots of positive semi-definite matrices which, surprisingly, appears to be new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.12057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the \emph{absorbing boundary rule}, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schr\"odinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an ``absorbing'' boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how, under some technical assumptions on the regularity (i.e., smoothness) of the detecting surface, the Lumer-Phillips theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. We also prove that the joint distribution of the detection times and places, according to the absorbing boundary rule, is governed by a POVM.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <title>Abstract semiclassical analysis of the van Hove model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the semiclassical limit $\hslash\to 0$ of a completely solvable model in quantum field theory: the van Hove model, describing a scalar field created and annihilated by an immovable source. Despite its simplicity, the van Hove model possesses many characterizing features of quantum fields, especially in the infrared region. In particular, the existence of non-Fock ground and equilibrium states in the presence of infrared singular sources makes a representation-independent algebraic approach of utmost importance. We make use of recent representation-independent techniques of infinite dimensional semiclassical analysis to establish the Bohr correspondence principle for the dynamics, equilibrium states, and long-time asymptotics in the van Hove model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of non-relativistic fermions in $\mathbb R^d$ interacting through a pair potential. Employing methods developed by Buchholz in the framework of resolvent algebras, we identify an extension of the CAR algebra where the dynamics acts as a group of *-automorphisms, which are continuous in time in all sectors for fixed particle numbers. In addition, we identify a suitable dense subalgebra where the time evolution is also strongly continuous. Finally, we briefly discuss how this framework could be used to construct KMS states in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19035v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the Ruijsenaars' action-angle duality in classical many-body integrable systems through the spectral duality transformation relating the classical spin chains and Gaudin models. For this purpose, the Lax matrices of many-body systems are represented in the multi-pole (Gaudin-like) form by introducing a fictitious spectral parameter. This form of Lax matrices is also interpreted as classical-classical version of quantum-classical duality.</description>

      <title>Duality of Navier-Stokes to a one-dimensional system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01389v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Navier-Stokes (NS) equations describe fluid motion via a high-dimensional, nonlinear system of partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their fundamental role, their behavior in turbulent regimes remains poorly understood, and their global regularity is an open Millennium Problem. Here, we show that \textbf{the NS system can be transformed to a nonlinear equation for the momentum loop \( \vec{P}(\theta, t)\), reducing the original problem in \( \mathbb{R}_3 \) to a one-dimensional problem}. A key consequence is the \textbf{No Explosion Theorem}, which rules out finite-time singularities for stochastic initial conditions, suggesting a pathway to proving NS regularity for deterministic data. Additionally, we derive an exact solution of the momentum loop equation, the \textbf{Euler ensemble}, which describes the \textbf{asymptotic state of decaying turbulence}. This solution, validated by numerical and experimental data, replaces heuristic turbulence models with an analytically derived structure. While the Euler ensemble solves a specific boundary problem, its universality as an attractor remains an open question. By reducing NS to a \textbf{nonlinear equation} on \( S_1 \), this work opens new pathways toward resolving turbulence and fluid mechanics' fundamental challenges.</description>

Abstract: We analyze semi-classical Schr\"odinger operators with potentials of class $C^{1,1/2}$ and establish commutator estimates for the associated projection operators in Schatten norms. These are then applied to prove quantitative versions of the local and phase space Weyl laws in $L^p$ spaces. We study both non-interacting, and interacting particle systems. In particular, we are able to treat the case of the minimizers of the Hartree energy in the case of repulsive singular pair interactions such as the Coulomb potential.</description>

Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the modular Hamiltonian associated to standard subspaces for a free scalar field in a globally hyperbolic spacetime in an arbitrary Gaussian state. We show how the modular Hamiltonian is related to the two-point function of the theory. For the restriction of the modular Hamiltonian to the subspace, we recover formulas that were obtained previously by Peschel, Casini and Huerta. We also show how the same results can be obtained more directly from the KMS condition, and generalize our results to general CCR algebras.</description>

      <title>Time-Global Regularity of the Navier-Stokes System with Hyper-Dissipation--Turbulent Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.05692v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of whether the hyper-dissipative (HD) Napier-Stokes (NS) system can exhibit spontaneous formation of singularities in the super-critical regime--the hyper-diffusion being generated by a fractional power of the Laplacian, say $\beta$, confined to interval $\bigl(1, \frac{5}{4}\bigr)$--has been a major open problem in the mathematical fluid dynamics since the foundational work of J.L. Lions in 1960s. In this work, an evidence of criticality of the Laplacian is presented, more precisely, a class of plausible blow-up scenarios is ruled out as soon as $\beta$ is greater than one. While the framework is based on the scale of sparseness of the super-level sets of the positive and negative parts of the components of the higher-order derivatives of the velocity recently introduced by the authors, a major novelty in the current work is classification of the HD flows near a potential spatiotemporal singularity in two main categories, homogeneous (the case consistent with a near-steady behavior) and non-homogenous (the case consistent with the formation and decay of turbulence). The main theorem states that in the non-homogeneous case any $\beta$ greater than one prevents a singularity. In order to illustrate the impact of this result in a methodology-free setting, a two-parameter family of dynamically rescaled blow-up profiles is considered, and it is shown that as soon as $\beta$ is greater than one, a new region in the parameter space is ruled out. More importantly, the region is a neighborhood (in the parameter space) of the self-similar profile, i.e., the approximately self-similar blow-up, a prime suspect in possible singularity formation, is ruled out for all HD NS models.</description>

      <title>An $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree and $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey chain of Andrews, Schilling and the author is extended to a four-parameter $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree. As main application of this tree, we prove the Kanade-Russell conjecture for a three-parameter family of Rogers-Ramanujan-type identities related to the principal characters of the affine Lie algebra $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$. Combined with known $q$-series results, this further implies an $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$-analogue of the celebrated Andrews-Gordon $q$-series identities. We also use the $\mathrm{A}_2$ Bailey tree to prove a Rogers-Selberg-type identity for the characters of the principal subspaces of $\mathrm{A}_2^{(1)}$ indexed by arbitrary level-$k$ dominant integral weights $\lambda$. This generalises a result of Feigin, Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin for $\lambda=k\Lambda_0$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Nahm sums for symmetrizable matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nahm sums are specific $q$-hypergeometric series associated with symmetric positive definite matrices. In this paper we study Nahm sums associated with symmetrizable matrices. We show that one direction of Nahm's conjecture, which was proven by Calegari, Garoufalidis, and Zagier for the symmetric case, also holds for the symmetrizable case. This asserts that the modularity of a Nahm sum implies that a certain element in a Bloch group associated with the Nahm sum is a torsion element. During the proof, we investigate the radial asymptotics of Nahm sums. Finally, we provide lists of candidates of modular Nahm sums for symmetrizable matrices based on numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of NAE-SAT solutions in the condensation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The local behavior of typical solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) describes many important phenomena including clustering thresholds, decay of correlations, and the behavior of message passing algorithms. When the constraint density is low, studying the planted model is a powerful technique for determining this local behavior which in many examples has a simple Markovian structure. The work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, M\"{u}ller (2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold.
  Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random CSPs in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) class. Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation $O(n^{-1/2})$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a liquid-gas phase transition for continuous Gibbs point process in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with Quermass interaction. The Hamiltonian we consider is a linear combination of the volume $\mathcal{V}$, the surface measure $\mathcal{S}$ and the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic $\chi$ of a halo of particles (i.e. an union of balls centred at the positions of particles). We show the non-uniqueness of infinite volume Gibbs measures for special values of activity and temperature, provided that the temperature is low enough. Moreover we show the non-differentiability of the pressure at these critical points. Our main tool is an adaptation of the Pirogov-Sina\"i-Zahradnik theory for continuous systems with interaction exhibiting a saturation property.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of compiling graphs under the parity transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish a mathematical framework that utilizes concepts from graph theory to formalize the parity transformation, an encoding strategy for compiling optimization problems on quantum devices. We introduce the transformation as a mapping that encompasses all possible compiled hypergraphs and investigate its uniqueness properties in more detail. Specifically, by introducing so-called loop labelings, we derive an alternative expression of the preimage of any set of compiled hypergraphs under this encoding procedure when all equivalence classes of graphs are being considered. We then deduce equivalent conditions for the injectivity of the parity transformation on any subset of all equivalences classes of graphs. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate that the parity transformation is not an injective mapping, and also introduce an important class of physical layouts and their corresponding set of constraints whose preimage is uniquely determined. In addition, we provide an algorithm which is based on classical algorithms from theoretical computer science and computes a compiled physical layout in this class in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Gibbs States are Unentangled and Efficiently Preparable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted by $\rho = e^{-\beta H}/ \operatorname{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution over product states for all $\beta &lt; 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a constant. This proof of sudden death of thermal entanglement resolves the fundamental question of whether many-body systems can exhibit entanglement at high temperature.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over product states. In particular, for any $\beta &lt; 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^2)$, we can prepare a state $\varepsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one quantum circuit and $\operatorname{poly}(n, 1/\varepsilon)$ classical overhead.</description>

Abstract: We consider 1+1 field generalization of the elliptic Calogero-Moser model. It is shown that the Lax connection satisfies the classical non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structure of Maillet type. Next, we consider 1+1 field analogue of the spin Calogero-Moser model and its multipole (or multispin) extension. Finally, we discuss the field analogue of the classical IRF-Vertex correspondence, which relates utralocal and non-ultralocal $r$-matrix structures.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. Using the FEP allows us to model the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations among subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations among subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>On the field analogue of elliptic spin Calogero-Moser model: Lax pair and equations of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lax pair for the field analogue of the classical spin elliptic Calogero-Moser is proposed. Namely, using the previously known Lax matrix we suggest an ansatz for the accompany matrix. The presented construction is valid when the matrix of spin variables ${\mathcal S}\in{\rm Mat}(N,\mathbb C)$ satisfies the condition ${\mathcal S}^2=c_0{\mathcal S}$ with some constant $c_0\in\mathbb C$. It is proved that the Lax pair satisfies the Zakharov-Shabat equation with unwanted term, thus providing equations of motion on the unreduced phase space. The unwanted term vanishes after additional reduction. In the special case ${\rm rank}(\mathcal S)=1$ we show that the reduction provides the Lax pair of the spinless field Calogero-Moser model obtained earlier by Akhmetshin, Krichever and Volvovski.</description>

      <title>The Existence and Distribution of Photon Spheres Near Spherically Symmetric Black Holes -- A Geometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14035v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon sphere has attracted significant attention since the capture of black hole shadow images by Event Horizon Telescope. Recently, a number of studies have highlighted that the number of photon spheres and their distributions near black holes are strongly constrained by black hole properties. Specifically, for black holes with event horizons and proper asymptotic behaviors, the number of stable and unstable photon spheres satisfies the relation $n_{\text{stable}} - n_{\text{unstable}} = -1$. In this study, we provide a new proof on this relation using a geometric analysis, which is carried out using intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of black hole spacetimes. Firstly, we demonstrate the existence of photon spheres near black holes assuming most general asymptotic behaviors (asymptotically flat black holes, asymptotically de-Sitter and anti-de-Sitter black holes). Subsequently, we prove that the stable and unstable photon spheres near black holes must be one-to-one alternatively separated from each other, such that each unstable photon sphere is sandwiched between two stable photon spheres (and each stable photon sphere is sandwiched between two unstable photon spheres). Our analysis is applicable to any spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stable bi-frequency spinor modes as Dark Matter candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that spinor systems with scalar self-interaction, such as the Dirac--Klein--Gordon system with Yukawa coupling or the Soler model, generically have bi-frequency solitary wave solutions. We develop the approach to stability properties of such waves and use the radial reduction to show that indeed the (linear) stability is available for a wide range of parameters. We show that only bi-frequency modes can be dynamically stable and suggest that stable bi-frequency modes can serve as storages of the Dark Matter. The approach is based on linear stability results of one-frequency solitary waves in (3+1)D Soler model, which we obtain as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Engineering of Anyons on M5-Probes via Flux Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These extended lecture notes survey a novel derivation of anyonic topological order (as seen in fractional quantum Hall systems) on single magnetized M5-branes probing Seifert orbi-singularities ("geometric engineering" of anyons), which we motivate from fundamental open problems in the field of quantum computing.
  The rigorous construction is non-Lagrangian and non-perturbative, based on previously neglected global completion of the M5-brane's tensor field by flux-quantization consistent with its non-linear self-duality and its twisting by the bulk C-field. This exists only in little-studied non-abelian generalized cohomology theories, notably in a twisted equivariant (and "twistorial") form of unstable Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis H").
  As a result, topological quantum observables form Pontrjagin homology algebras of mapping spaces from the orbi-fixed worldvolume into a classifying 2-sphere. Remarkably, results from algebraic topology imply from this the quantum observables and modular functor of abelian Chern-Simons theory, as well as braid group actions on defect anyons of the kind envisioned as hardware for topologically protected quantum gates.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Between Compatibility and Deterministic Underlying States in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between the pairwise compatibility of all observables in a scenario, and our ability to create a deterministic underlying-state model for that scenario (a type of hidden-variable model, typically used in the contextuality and nonlocality literature, where quantum states are treated as probability measures over ``better-defined states''). We first argue that the quantum state update rule implies that underlying-state models must update their states in agreement with the rules of conditional probability. We then demonstrate that deterministic underlying-state models meeting this criterion exist if and only if the system's observables are pairwise compatible, which is equivalent to the theoretical predictions of sequential measurements being independent of measurement order.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE expansion in super-renormalizable QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the issue regarding the asymptotic behavior of power-expansion/OPE-expansion in supper-renormalizable theory. Using an $O(N)$-model with $N$-components scalars coupled through quartic interaction at the next-to-leading $\frac{1}{N}$ order in the large-$N$ expansion, we show that the IR subtractions cause addition factorial enhancements for high order/power terms in the coefficient functions. Moreover, there are also factorial enhancements for the operator condensates, and the factorial enhancements cancel between coefficient functions and operators only off-diagonally across different powers. The factorial enhancements can be both alternating and non-alternating. The former are similar to ``UV renormalon'' of coefficient functions and cancel with factorial enhancements of operators at lower powers in diagrams with negative degrees of UV divergences. The latter are similar to ``IR renormalon'' and cancel with factorial enhancements of higher dimensional renormalized operators in diagrams with positive degrees of UV divergences. The factorial enhancement itself will render the momentum-space power expansion divergent.</description>

      <title>Mixing rate exponent of planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022) recently proved the scaling relations for planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation. In particular, they showed that the one-arm exponent and the mixing rate exponent are sufficient to derive the other near-critical exponents. The scaling limit of critical FK percolation is conjectured to be a conformally invariant random collection of loops called the conformal loop ensemble (CLE). In this paper, we define the CLE analog of the mixing rate exponent. Assuming the convergence of FK percolation to CLE, we show that the mixing rate exponent for FK percolation agrees with that of CLE. We prove that the CLE$_\kappa$ mixing rate exponent equals $\frac{3 \kappa}{8}-1$, thereby answering Question 3 of Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022). The derivation of the CLE exponent is based on an exact formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative between the marginal laws of the odd-level and even-level CLE loops, which is obtained from the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and CLE.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>
