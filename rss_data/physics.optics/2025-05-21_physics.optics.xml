      <title>Liquid combs: broadband light with equidistance and without stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadband light sources with well-defined spectral structures are vital for science and technology. However, the evenly spaced lines of frequency combs represent only a small subset of all possible structured white-light sources. We demonstrate liquid combs: optical states that preserve spectral equidistance but lack temporal stability. By engineering the gain and dispersion of semiconductor laser cavities, we produce light that possesses rapid phase fluctuations but maintains relative phase differences between modes that vary identically. We show experimentally that this phenomenon occurs in multiple laser platforms -- across multiple octaves -- through the creation of a metrological technique that determines the phase differences. We also show theoretically that this is a general phenomenon that can be described using a mean-field theory. These liquid combs are attractive for many applications due to having wider bandwidths than frequency combs, and more generally, they represent the long-sought realization of structured white-light sources that are not combs.</description>

      <title>Two-photon microscopy through scattering media harnessing speckle autocorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon (2P) microscopy is a powerful technique for deep-tissue fluorescence imaging; however, tissue scattering limits its effectiveness for depth imaging using conventional approaches. Despite typical strategies having been put forward to extend depth imaging capabilities based on wave-front shaping (WFS), computationally recovering images remains a significant challenge using 2P signal. In this work, we demonstrate the successful reconstruction of fluorescent objects behind scattering layers using 2P microscopy, utilizing the optical memory effect (ME) along with the speckle autocorrelation technique and a phase retrieval algorithm. Our results highlight the effectiveness of this method, offering significant potential for improving depth imaging capabilities in 2P microscopy through scattering media.</description>

Abstract: Polarization control and switchability are among the most unique features of "metasurfaces" as compared with diffractive optics technologies of the past. Here, we review how the polarization control afforded by the advent of present-day metasurfaces compares to diffractive elements of previous decades, clarifying from a functional perspective what is new, and what is not.</description>

      <title>Generic full-vector angular spectrum method for calculating diffraction of arbitrary electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous vector angular spectrum methods have been presented to model the vectorial nature of diffractive electromagnetic field, facilitating optical field engineering in polarization-related and high numerical aperture systems. However, balancing accuracy and efficiency in state-of-the-art vector methods is challenging, especially with not well-defined incident fields. Here, we propose a full-vector angular spectrum method for accurate, efficient, robust diffraction computation, allowing truly arbitrary incidence by precisely modeling the projection rule among Cartesian polarization components. We address a prior oversight, that the longitudinal electric field's projection onto the diffracted field was insufficiently considered. Notably, our method inherently handles reflection and transmission at dielectric interfaces, which can be viewed as k-space filters. For rotationally symmetric system, it achieves unprecedented computation times of a few seconds, speeding up optical design via faster input-output mapping in optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Information-optimal measurement: From fixed sampling protocols to adaptive spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All measurements of continuous signals rely on taking discrete snapshots, with the Nyquist-Shannon theorem dictating sampling paradigms. We present a broader framework of information-optimal measurement, showing that traditional sampling is optimal only when we are entirely ignorant about the system under investigation. This insight unlocks methods that efficiently leverage prior information to overcome long-held fundamental sampling limitations. We demonstrate this for optical spectroscopy - vital to research and medicine - and show how adaptively selected measurements yield higher information in medical blood analysis, optical metrology, and hyperspectral imaging. Through our rigorous statistical framework, performance never falls below conventional sampling while providing complete uncertainty quantification in real time. This establishes a new paradigm where measurement devices operate as information-optimal agents, fundamentally changing how scientific instruments collect and process data.</description>

      <title>Chiral Valley Edge States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valleytronics has emerged as a promising paradigm, enabling comprehensive control of the valley degree of freedom (DoF) for energy-efficient and high-speed information processing. However, backscattering-induced valley depolarization remains a fundamental limitation, stemming from the weak topological protection of the valley Hall phase. Here, we propose and demonstrate the concept of chiral valley edge states, which integrate the robust unidirectional chiral edge states with valley DoF. By controlling the valley Dirac masses, we selectively confine the chiral edge band around a single valley, enabling back-scattering-free propagation while imparting valley polarization. Our strategy not only addresses the valley depolarization issue but also introduces a unique functionality--valley multiplexing--allowing independent and arbitrary control over waves associated with different valley polarizations. We demonstrate our concept experimentally within hybrid topological photonic crystal systems composed of Chern and valley photonic crystals. Moreover, two key components for valley multiplexing are demonstrated: a valley (de-)multiplexer and a valley-locked waveguide crossing, facilitating non-interfering signal routing. Our results establish a novel interplay between the topological quantum Hall and valley Hall phases, offering a new framework for robust valley-based information processing.</description>

      <title>Phonon Mean Free Path Spectroscopy By Raman Thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we exemplify on a bulk silicon sample that Raman thermometry is capable of phonon mean free path (PMFP) spectroscopy. Our experimental approach is similar to the variation of different characteristic length scales $l_{c}$ during thermal reflectance measurements in the time or frequency domain and transient thermal grating spectroscopy. In place of $l_{c}$, we vary the laser focus spot size ($w_{e}$) and the light penetration depth ($h_{\alpha}$) during one-laser Raman thermometry (1LRT) measurements. For our largest $w_{e}$ values, the derived effective thermal conductivities $\kappa_{eff}$ converge towards the bulk thermal conductivity $\kappa_{bulk}$ for silicon. However, towards smaller $w_{e}$ values, we observe a pronounced increase for the $\kappa_{eff}$ values, which amounts up to a factor of 5.3 at 293K and even 8.3 at 200K. We mainly assign this phenomenon to quasi-ballistic phonon transport. As a result, we can compare our measured $\kappa_{eff}(w_{e})$ trends with the thermal accumulation function $\kappa_{cum}$ and its dependence on the phonon mean free path $l_{ph}$, which we derive from ab initio solutions of the linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE). Since the variation of $w_{e}$ can be experimentally cumbersome, we also suggest varying $h_{\alpha}(\lambda)$ via the applied Raman laser wavelength $\lambda$ during 1LRT. In this regard, we present proof-of-principle 1LRT measurements, yielding a step-like $\kappa_{eff}(\lambda)$ trend for four different $\lambda$ values, which we also interpret in terms of quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results shall seed future PMFP spectroscopy based on 1LRT, which can directly be benchmarked against state-of-art theory by comparison of $\kappa_{\text{cum}}$ trends and not only $\kappa$ values, aiming to test our understanding of the intricate phonon transport physics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Arbitrary Electromagnetic Fields and Temporal Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that arbitrary 3D electromagnetic fields are transient solutions to Maxwell's equations and provide a simple equation to find how the field evolves over time. Multiple 3D fields can be realized at different times by superposing with an initial phase. Phase optimization algorithms allow for a phase-only modulated input signal. The necessary input wavepacket before a focus lens to create the 3D field can be found by finding the time-variation through a spatial plane. These results provide a way for designing arbitrary transient 3D waves and finding the wavepacket needed to input into a focusing lens.</description>

      <title>Single-photon detection enabled by negative differential conductivity in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting individual light quanta is essential for quantum information, space exploration, advanced machine vision, and fundamental science. Here, we introduce a novel single photon detection mechanism using highly photosensitive non-equilibrium electron phases in moir\'e materials. Using tunable bands in bilayer graphene/hexagonal-boron nitride superlattices, we engineer negative differential conductance and a sensitive bistable state capable of detecting single photons. Operating in this regime, we demonstrate single-photon counting at mid-infrared (11.3 microns) and visible wavelengths (675 nanometres) and temperatures up to 25 K. This detector offers new prospects for broadband, high-temperature quantum technologies with CMOS compatibility and seamless integration into photonic integrated circuits (PICs). Our analysis suggests the mechanism underlying our device operation originates from negative differential velocity, and represents an important milestone in the field of high-bias transport in two-dimensional moir\'e quantum materials.</description>

Abstract: We present a frequency-correlated non-degenerate photon-pair source consisting of a second-order nonlinear crystal that generates ultraviolet UV-A and infrared light via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Quantum imaging and sensing techniques like quantum imaging with undetected light and quantum ghost imaging leverage on wavelength correlations between down-converted photon pairs to decouple sensing and detection wavelengths, thereby exploiting established camera technology within the visible spectrum. Our results open up novel quantum sensing application scenarios in the ultraviolet domain, with potential implications for advancements in biomedical and non-destructive testing fields.</description>

      <title>A heralded quantum amplifier of multi-photon states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum networking systems will inevitably require methods to overcome photon loss. While the no-cloning theorem forbids perfect and deterministic amplification of unknown quantum states, probabilistic heralded amplification schemes offer a viable path forward. Yet, for over a decade, successful multi-photon state amplification has remained out of reach, despite the fundamental importance of such states in achieving quantum advantage in optical applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity and post-selection-free amplifier for multi-photon states. We achieve heralded amplification of states with up to two photons in a single optical mode, with over a hundredfold intensity gain, and verify the coherence-preserving operation of our scheme. Our approach is scalable to higher photon numbers and enables noiseless amplification of complex multi-photon quantum states, with applications in large-scale quantum communication systems, distributed quantum metrology, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Carrier Thermalization and Biexciton Formation in a Polar ZnO/Zn$_{0.84}$Mg$_{0.16}$O Quantum Well Probed by Ultrafast Broadband Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of excitons in a 2.6 nm-thick $\mathrm{ZnO/Zn_{0.84}Mg_{0.16}O}$ quantum well grown on a c-axis sapphire substrate, using non-degenerate time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. A pump pulse at 266 nm generates photocarriers within the ZnMgO barriers, and their dynamics is monitored through time-resolved differential reflectance measurements using a supercontinuum probe spanning the 345-400 nm spectral range. Photocarriers generated in the barriers rapidly relax into the quantum well, where they form excitons within sub-picosecond timescales. These excitons quickly thermalize and become localized, likely due to interface disorder or well-width fluctuations, as supported by photoluminescence measurements showing a clear Stokes shift and the absence of free exciton emission. A phonon-assisted absorption process, leading to the effective thermalization of excitons, is observed and analyzed. We identify moreover a negative differential reflectance feature as a photoinduced absorption into a biexciton state, with a binding energy ranging from 18 to 22 meV depending on temperature.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the dual generation of type-0 and type-II spontaneous parametric down conversions (SPDCs) within a single periodically poled rubidium-doped KTiOPO$_4$ (PPRKTP) waveguide. By coupling a 45 degree linearly polarized pump laser into the waveguide, both SPDC processes are concurrently excited: the type-0 SPDC process is facilitated via third-order quasi-phase matching (QPM) utilizing the nonlinear coefficient $d_{33}$ , while the type-II SPDC process employs first-order QPM with the nonlinear coefficient $d_{24}$. This dual-SPDC scheme holds potential for applications in quantum communication protocols targeting the telecommunication wavelength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy of H2 and D2 molecules physisorbed within a plasmonic picocavity at 10 K. The intense Raman peaks resulting from the rotational and vibrational transitions are observed at subnanometer gap distances of the junction formed by an Ag tip and an Ag(111) surface, where a picocavity-enhanced field plays a crucial role. A significant redshift of the H-H stretch frequency is observed as the gap distance decreases, while the D-D stretch frequency is unaffected. Density functional theory, path-integral molecular dynamics, and quantum anharmonic vibrational energy calculations suggest that this unexpected isotope effect is explained by a different molecular density between H2 and D2 on the surface.</description>

      <title>A Physical Interpretation of Imaginary Time Delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering matrix $S$ linearly relates the vector of incoming waves to outgoing wave excitations, and contains an enormous amount of information about the scattering system and its connections to the scattering channels. Time delay is one way to extract information from $S$, and the transmission time delay $\tau_T$ is a complex (even for Hermitian systems with unitary scattering matrices) measure of how long a wave excitation lingers before being transmitted. The real part of $\tau_T$ is a well-studied quantity, but the imaginary part of $\tau_T$ has not been systematically examined experimentally, and theoretical predictions for its behavior have not been tested. Here we experimentally test the predictions of Asano, et al. [Nat. Comm. 7, 13488 (2016)] for the imaginary part of transmission time delay in a non-unitary scattering system. We utilize Gaussian time-domain pulses scattering from a 2-port microwave graph supporting a series of well-isolated absorptive modes to show that the carrier frequency of the pulses is changed in the scattering process by an amount in agreement with the imaginary part of the independently determined complex transmission time delay, $\text{Im}[\tau_T]$, from frequency-domain measurements of the sub-unitary $S$ matrix. Our results also generalize and extend those of Asano, et al., establishing a means to predict pulse propagation properties of non-Hermitian systems over a broad range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Optimization of Core-Shell Particles with Discrete Materials for Directional Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic structures traditionally grapples with the complexities of discrete parameters, such as real materials, often resorting to costly global optimization methods. This paper introduces an approach that leverages generative deep learning to map discrete parameter sets into a continuous latent space, enabling direct gradient-based optimization. For scenarios with non-differentiable physics evaluation functions, a neural network is employed as a differentiable surrogate model. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated by optimizing the directional scattering properties of core-shell nanoparticles composed of a selection of realistic materials. We derive suggestions for core-shell geometries with strong forward scattering and minimized backscattering. Our findings reveal significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance when compared to global optimization techniques. Beyond nanophotonics design problems, this framework holds promise for broad applications across all types of inverse problems constrained by discrete variables.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>Roughness-Limited Performance in Ultra-Low-Loss Lithium Niobate Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving low optical loss is critical for scaling complex photonic systems. Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) offers strong electro-optic and nonlinear properties in a compact platform, making it ideal for quantum and nonlinear optics. While $Q$ factors above $10^7$ have been achieved, they remain below the intrinsic material limit. We present a systematic study of scattering losses due to roughness in TFLN racetrack cavities, isolating contributions from sidewall and interface roughness. Quality factors up to $27 \times 10^6$ are demonstrated in waveguides with widths of $2.2\lambda$ ($\sim3.5\,\mu$m), where interface roughness dominates, and up to $1.2 \times 10^7$ in narrower waveguides $0.8\lambda$ wide ($\sim1.2\,\mu$m), where sidewall roughness is the primary limitation. Our modeling framework, based on 3D wave simulations informed by AFM-measured roughness, is material-independent and broadly applicable across integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Protecting information in a parametrically driven hybrid quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14354v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <title>A convolutional neural network technique for online tracking of the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure liquids, liquid mixtures and suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have used convolutional neural network in a classification task to track the radius evolution of levitating evaporating microdroplets of pure diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol water polystyrene microparticles suspension, dipropylene glycol water mixture and dipropylene glycol water silica nanoparticles suspension. We discretized a wider radii range into short radii segments, labeled them with class numbers and generated theoretically light scattering patterns from Mie theory. Then the network was trained on the theoretical images and used to classify unlabeled experimentally recorded Mie scattering patterns from the evaporating microdroplets. A plot of the class average radii versus the camera s time step revealed the profile of the entire droplet radius evolution. We were able to work with approximately 1500 classes and showed that the technique has the potential to distinguish droplet size difference of 5 nm. We expect it to be applicable for online or real time tracking of droplet evaporation.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Synthetic Gauge Fields in Ultracold Atoms via Spatially Engineered Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms, typically manipulated by scalar beams with uniform polarization, have propelled advances in quantum simulation, computation, and metrology. Yet, vector beams (VBs) -- structured light with spatially varying polarization -- remain unexplored in this context, despite their enhanced tunability and broad optical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel scheme to generate synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atoms via VB-mediated coupling of internal states. This approach enables angular stripe phases across an expanded parameter range, achieving a three-order-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and facilitating experimental observation. We further present an all-optical method to create topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology governed by VB parameters. Our findings establish VBs as powerful tools for quantum control and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>A Mega-FPS low light camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From biology and astronomy to quantum optics, there is a critical need for high frame rate, high quantum efficiency imaging. In practice, most cameras only satisfy one of these requirements. Here we introduce interlaced fast kinetics imaging, a technique that allows burst video acquisition at frame rates up to 3.33 Mfps using a commercial EMCCD camera with single-photon sensitivity. This approach leverages EMCCD's intrinsic fast row transfer dynamics by introducing a tilted lens array into the imaging path, creating a spatially distributed grid of exposed pixels, each aligned to its own column of the sensor. The remaining unexposed pixels serve as in-situ storage registers, allowing subsequent frames to be captured after just one row shift operation. Our interlaced fast kinetics camera maintains 50% contrast for square wave intensity modulation frequencies up to 1.61 MHz. We provide benchmarks of the video performance by capturing two dimensional videos of spatially evolving patterns that repeat every 2$\mu$s, with spatial resolution of 11$\times$15 pixels. Our approach is compatible with commercial EMCCDs and opens a new route to ultra-fast imaging at single-photon sensitivity with applications from fast fluorescence imaging to photon correlation measurement.</description>
