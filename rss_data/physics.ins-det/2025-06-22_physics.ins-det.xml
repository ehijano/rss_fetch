      <title>Simulation studies of the isovector reorientation effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The isovector reorientation (IVR) effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target provides a novel means to probe the nuclear isovector potential which gives rise to the nuclear symmetry energy. The simulations studies on the experimental measurement of IVR effect using SAMURAI terminal at RIKEN Nishina center have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. By introducing a well designed polarimeter to detect the $\mathrm{p}(\vec{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d})\mathrm{p}$ elastic scattering, the monitoring of the tensor polarization of deuteron beam can be implemented. The protons and neutrons produced by the breakup of polarized deuterons scattering off heavy targets are designed to be measured by proton drift chamber (PDC) combined with the SAMURAI magnet and NEBULA detector, respectively. The detector responses are simulated using Geant4 framework, while the events of the deuteron elastic breakup are generated by an Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. The results of reconstructing the deuteron breakup events demonstrate the feasibility to detect the IVR effect at SAMURAI with both longitudinal and transverse tensor polarized deuteron beams with a polarization degree of approximate 80\%.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of acceptor removal mechanism and impact ionization on proton irradiated 300 $\mu$m thick LGAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs) are the leading 4D sensing technology selected for use in the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). However, their proximity to the interaction point makes them highly susceptible to radiation-induced damage. Such degradation effects can be effectively studied through TCAD simulations. In this work, we extend the validation of a previously developed proton damage model for transitional sensors. The enhanced model for LGAD also incorporates an acceptor removal mechanism and modifications in impact ionization behavior, resulting in a more comprehensive and reliable tool for fabrication and performance analysis.</description>

      <title>Bias Variation Compensation in Perimeter-Gated SPAD TRNGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random number generators that utilize arrays of entropy source elements suffer from bias variation (BV). Despite the availability of efficient debiasing algorithms, optimized implementations of hardware friendly options depend on the bit bias in the raw bit streams and cannot accommodate a wide BV. In this work, we present a 64 x 64 array of perimeter gated single photon avalanche diodes (pgSPADs), fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS technology, as a source of entropy to generate random binary strings with a BV compensation technique. By applying proper gate voltages based on the devices' native dark count rates, we demonstrate less than 1% BV for a raw-bit generation rate of 2 kHz/pixel at room temperature. The raw bits were debiased using the classical iterative Von Neumann's algorithm and the debiased bits were found to pass all of the 16 tests from NIST's Statistical Test Suite.</description>

      <title>Test beam measurements and computer simulations of the ATLAS ITk R2 silicon strip detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS Inner Tracker, the future innermost part of the ATLAS detector, is an all-silicon tracker composed of pixel and strip modules, designed to cope with the extreme conditions expected during High-Luminosity LHC runs. Thorough testing of modules during the individual phases of their development is critical to ensure the required performance level of the whole tracker. This document presents results obtained from electron beam measurements of the ATLAS ITk R2 end-cap strip module. Key performance metrics are presented and discussed for both perpendicular and angled beam incidence. Computer simulations of the module were performed in the Allpix-Squared framework and the results were compared to experimental data.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the absolute single-photon detection efficiency of HRPPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixelated High Rate Picosecond Photon Detectors (HRPPDs) by Incom Inc. are promising photosensors for use in Ring Imaging CHerenkov (RICH) detectors, where a high gain, sub-mm position resolution and sub-100ps timing resolution are required in a single photon mode. Quantum Efficiency (QE) has been measured for the first batch of EIC HRPPDs both by Incom and EIC research groups at Jefferson Lab and Brookhaven Lab, with peak values at $\sim$365 nm typically exceeding 30%. In this study, we present a first direct measurement of HRPPD Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) being equal to 19.3 $\pm$ 0.2 (stat) $\pm$ 0.8 (sys)% at 398.6 nm, in a photoelectron pulse counting mode using a picosecond diode laser. HRPPD QE at the same spot and at the same wavelength was evaluated to be 24.3 $\pm$ 0.1 (stat) $\pm$ 0.5 (sys)%, leading to a Collection Efficiency (CE) estimate of $\sim$79%, which is consistent with the expectations.</description>

      <title>Improvement of Nuclide Detection through Graph Spectroscopic Analysis Framework and its Application to Nuclear Facility Upset Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to improve the detection limit for radionuclides using spectroscopic radiation detectors and the arrival time of each detected radiation quantum. We enable this method using a neural network with an attention mechanism. We illustrate the method on the detection of Cesium release from a nuclear facility during an upset, and our method shows $2\times$ improvement over the traditional spectroscopic method. We hypothesize that our method achieves this performance increase by modulating its detection probability by the overall rate of probable detections, specifically by adapting detection thresholds based on temporal event distributions and local spectral features, and show evidence to this effect. We believe this method is applicable broadly and may be more successful for radionuclides with more complicated decay chains than Cesium; we also note that our method can generalize beyond the addition of arrival time and could integrate other data about each detection event, such as pulse quality, location in detector, or even combining the energy and time from detections in different detectors.</description>

      <title>Performance studies of thin gas gap Resistive Plate Chamber prototypes with low Global Warming Potential gases for the ANUBIS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) have traditionally operated with high Global Warming Potential (GWP) gas mixtures, adding to the environmental footprint of large-scale physics experiments. In response, efforts are underway to explore environmentally friendly alternatives as a long-term solution and low-GWP as a feasible short- to medium-term replacement for standard RPC gases. This study tests a few mixtures in 50 cm $\times$ 50 cm, 1 mm single-gap High-Pressure Laminate (HPL) RPC prototypes, as part of ongoing efforts for the ANUBIS experiment, which will operate with a 9.8 m$^{3}$ active gas volume. Measurements of performance metrics, including current and efficiency, are conducted with both standard and modified mixtures to assess their viability in sustaining detector performance. The results are also relevant for large RPC systems in other experiments at the LHC, such as ATLAS and CMS, as well as in applications beyond the LHC, supporting a shift toward environmentally sustainable gas mixtures in particle physics detectors.</description>

      <title>Operation and performance of the CMS silicon strip tracker with proton-proton collisions at the CERN LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Salient aspects of the commissioning, calibration, and performance of the CMS silicon strip tracker are discussed, drawing on experience during operation with proton-proton collisions delivered by the CERN LHC. The data were obtained with a variety of luminosities. The operating temperature of the strip tracker was changed several times during this period and results are shown as a function of temperature in several cases. Details of the system performance are presented, including occupancy, signal-to-noise ratio, Lorentz angle, and single-hit spatial resolution. Saturation effects in the APV25 readout chip preamplifier observed during early Run 2 are presented, showing the effect on various observables and the subsequent remedy. Studies of radiation effects on the strip tracker are presented both for the optical readout links and the silicon sensors. The observed effects are compared to simulation, where available, and they generally agree well with expectations.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the photometric performance of a high-time-resolution photon-counting imager for optical astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical observations with high time resolution are essential for understanding the origin of sub-millisecond timescale astronomical phenomena, including giant radio pulses from the Crab Pulsar. We have developed a high-speed imaging system called the Imager of MPPC-based Optical photoN counter from Yamagata (IMONY). The system uses a customized Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC), which independently reads out signals from all $8\times8$ pixels and functions as an imager based on a Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode array. This system assigns timestamps to detected photons with a time resolution of 100 ns. We installed IMONY on the 3.8 m aperture Seimei Telescope in Okayama, Japan. We have successfully detected the 34-ms period of the Crab Pulsar and imaged stars in the sensor's field of view. However, we have also found that a small fraction of the pixels have shown double or multiple pulses that are used for photon arrival timing. This situation is likely due to circuit noise and may unfortunately result in overestimating the number of photons detected. In order to precisely estimate the photon flux of targets or the sky background, calibration of such over-counts is important. We measured the number of detected photons relative to the light intensity of each pixel in a laboratory environment. We estimated the number of spurious hit pulses caused by signal tail fluctuations exceeding the comparator threshold, based on the exponential distribution of time intervals between pulses. These are distinct from typical SiPM afterpulses and originate from electronic effects in our readout system. After applying the calibration to the observed data, we confirmed the linearity between the V-band magnitudes of stars and the number of detected photons.</description>

      <title>Detection of twisted radiowaves with Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the outer electron in an alkali atom in the presence of structured electromagnetic waves is described. The interaction of the alkali Rydberg atom with twisted radiowaves is considered. The two schemes for Rydberg-atom based detector of twisted radiowaves are proposed. According to the theoretical model for these detectors, they can record a source of twisted radiowaves with power down to several nW. The first scheme of the detector employs the nondipole transitions between Rydberg states induced by twisted radio photons. The second scheme involves the array of Rydberg-atom based antennas, every antenna measuring the dipole transitions excited by plane radiowaves comprising the twisted one.</description>

      <title>The Hyper-Kamiokande experiment: input to the update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyper-Kamiokande is a large infrastructure for particle and astroparticle physics being built in Japan and aiming to start operations by the end of 2027 whose objective is to address the most important questions in science today, for instance how the universe began and evolved.
  It aims to measure with the highest precision the leptonic Charge-Parity violation parameter using both a Mega-Watt intense neutrino beam and high-statistics atmospheric neutrino samples. The combination of these samples will break the degeneracies between the effects of the Mass Ordering and Charge-Parity violation, allowing for their measurement without relying on external information.
  Hyper-Kamiokande is also a neutrino observatory for astrophysical events that will collect the highest statistics due to its size. It will also be able to precisely measure solar neutrino oscillations and other astrophysics events as supernova bursts, relic supernova neutrinos, etc.
  Furthermore, due to its size and particle identification capability, the experiment has an excellent potential to search for proton decay, providing a significant improvement in discovery sensitivity over current searches for the proton lifetime and nucleon decays.
  Hyper-Kamiokande is expected to run at least 20 years from the start of operations and is supported by 10 countries in Europe that are contributing to its construction, future operation and data analysis. Prototyping and assembly are also being carried out at CERN. The reduction of the flux systematic uncertainties would benefit from new hadron production measurements at the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, also with a low-energy beam. A final upgrade of the magnetised off-axis near detector (ND280++) for the high-statistics phase in the 2030s aim to be sought and would benefit from CERN support.</description>

      <title>Directional Dark Field for Nanoscale Full-Field Transmission X-Ray Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark-field X-ray imaging offers unique insights into material structures by visualizing X-ray scattering rather than attenuation, revealing features invisible to conventional imaging techniques. While established approaches like grating-based and speckle-based imaging have demonstrated the utility of dark-field contrast in medical diagnostics and materials science, these methods have been primarily limited to laboratory and micro-CT systems. Building on the recent demonstration of dark-field imaging at the nanoscale using transmission X-ray microscopy, we extend this technique to retrieve directional small-angle scattering information. By analyzing both a test object and human primary tooth enamel, we show that our transmission X-ray microscopy setup can successfully retrieve directional scattering information with minimal modifications of existing systems. This advancement expands the capabilities of nanoscale dark-field imaging, offering new opportunities for investigating structural properties in a wide range of scientific fields.</description>

      <title>Quality assurance tests and techniques to investigate and improve hermeticity of ATLAS Phase II Resistive Plate Chamber detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Phase II upgrade of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer will involve the installation of approximately 1000 next-generation Resistive Plate Chamber (RPC) singlets. This upgrade aims to enhance detector coverage, increase hit efficiency, and improve timing precision, ultimately strengthening the precision and robustness of the muon trigger system. The upgrade is essential for maintaining the performance of the muon spectrometer in the high-luminosity environment of the HL-LHC, where increased radiation and event rates pose significant challenges. Currently, detector production is underway, with gas gaps being commercially produced in Italy. To ensure the integrity of these gas gaps, especially their mechanical properties and gas tightness, several investigative techniques have been proposed and implemented.
  This study discusses the results of Thermal Cycling tests performed on ATLAS RPC gas gaps. These tests were conducted between $-33^{\circ}$C and $+35^{\circ}$C in a climate room at University of Cambridge and $-20^{\circ}$C and $+30^{\circ}$C in laboratories at INFN Frascati, providing insights into the effects of mechanical stress due to thermal expansion on gas leaks. Additionally, it outlines various methods employed to assess and enhance the gas tightness of the detectors. The ultimate objective is to produce hermetic RPC detectors, minimising the emission of environmentally harmful gases and mitigating their impact on global warming.</description>

      <title>Measurement of SiPM Dark Currents and Annealing Recovery for Fluences Expected in ePIC Calorimeters at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) will be used to read out all calorimeters in the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). A thorough characterization of the radiation damage expected for SiPMs under anticipated EIC fluences is essential for accurate simulations, detector design, and effective operational strategies. In this study, we evaluate radiation damage for the specific SiPM models chosen for ePIC across the complete fluence range anticipated at the EIC, $10^8$ to $10^{12}$ 1-MeV $n_{\mathrm{eq}}$/cm$^2$ per year, depending on the calorimeter location. The SiPMs were irradiated using a 64 MeV proton beam provided by the University of California, Davis 76" Cyclotron. We measured the SiPM dark-current as a function of fluence and bias voltage and investigated the effectiveness of high-temperature annealing to recover radiation damage. These results provide a comprehensive reference for the design, simulation, and operational planning of all ePIC calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>A plug-and-play solution for characterizing two-way optical frequency transfer over free-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical clock networks connected by phase-coherent links offer significant potential for advancing fundamental research and diverse scientific applications. Free-space optical frequency transfer extends fiber-based connectivity to remote areas and holds the potential for global coverage via satellite links. Here we present a compact and robust portable, rack-integrated two-way free-space link characterization system. Equipped with plug-and-play capabilities, the system enables straightforward interfacing with various optical systems and facilitates quick deployment for field experiments. In this work, we achieve a fractional frequency instability of $2.0 \times 10^{-19}$ for an averaging time of 10 s over a 3.4 km horizontal fully folded intra-city free-space link. Moreover, the system maintains an uptime of $94\%$ over 15 hours, illustrating its reliability and effectiveness for high-precision optical frequency comparisons over free-space.</description>

      <title>nuSCOPE: A short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN for high-precision cross-section measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino cross-section experiments at the GeV scale is crucial in the precision era of oscillation physics and lepton flavor studies. In this document, we present a novel neutrino beam design that leverages the experience and R&amp;D achievements of the NP06/ENUBET and NuTag Collaborations and explore its potential implementation at CERN. This beam enables flux monitoring at the percent level and provides a neutrino energy measurement independent of final state particle reconstruction at the neutrino detector. As a result, it eliminates the two primary sources of systematic uncertainty in cross-section measurements: flux normalization and energy bias caused by nuclear effects. We provide a detailed description of the beam technology and instrumentation, along with an overview of its physics potential, with particular emphasis on cross-sections relevant to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this talk is to give an overview of the current status of the development of the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer ground based gravitational wave (GW) detectors and of their foreseen scientific goals. These detectors will be up to a factor 8 more sensitive across the band covered by current detectors, namely LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA, and will extend the accessible frequency band towards the low frequency regime, i.e., below 10 Hz. These improvements will not only enhance the number and quality of GW observations, but will also enable researchers to have access to sources and physical processes which are out of reach for current detectors and explore the possibility of detecting previously unknown GW sources. The improvement in sensitivity in the low frequency regime will also increase the observation time of compact binary coalescence events, strengthening the collaboration with electromagnetic observatories for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star events. In fact, current detectors proved that joint observations of GW events with electromagnetic observatories are not only possible, but they can also give us unprecedented insights on the underlying physics of astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Applying TDI to Hardware-Simulated Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many years of development have gone into producing instruments that meet the required noise performance of the LISA interferometric detection system. Concurrently, software simulations have been used to extensively develop the data analysis libraries to be used in the LISA pipeline, not least among which are the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) algorithms. To bridge the gap between these two, we are developing a hardware-in-the-loop testbed to apply realistic, time-varying delays to signals traveling between phasemeters. We have shown that the testbed adds a sufficiently low amount of noise across the entire relevant LISA spectrum. We have also injected a realistic gravitational wave signal, generated via the LISA Data Challenge codebase, and successfully extracted it using TDI to remove the obscuring frequency noise of the carrier signal. Future efforts will expand the testbed to create a representative simulation of the entire LISA constellation, with an eye towards its use as a tool to aid in the development of the LISA data analysis pipelines.</description>
