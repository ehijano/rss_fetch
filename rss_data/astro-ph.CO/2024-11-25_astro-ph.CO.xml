      <title>Origin of cosmological neutrino mass bounds: background $\textit{versus}$ perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological upper bound on the total neutrino mass is the dominant limit on this fundamental parameter. Recent observations-soon to be improved-have strongly tightened it, approaching the lower limit set by oscillation data. Understanding its physical origin, robustness, and model-independence becomes pressing. Here, we explicitly separate for the first time the two distinct cosmological neutrino-mass effects: the impact on background evolution, related to the energy in neutrino masses; and the "kinematic" impact on perturbations, related to neutrino free-streaming. We scrutinize how they affect CMB anisotropies, introducing two effective masses enclosing $\textit{background}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Backg.}$) and $\textit{perturbations}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$) effects. We analyze CMB data, finding that the neutrino-mass bound is mostly a background measurement, i.e., how the neutrino energy density evolves with time. The bound on the "kinematic" variable $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$ is largely relaxed, $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.} &lt; 0.8\,\mathrm{eV}$. This work thus adds clarity to the physical origin of the cosmological neutrino-mass bound, which is mostly a measurement of the neutrino equation of state, providing also hints to evade such a bound.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Clustering with LSST: Effects of Number Count Bias from Blending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will survey the southern sky to create the largest galaxy catalog to date, and its statistical power demands an improved understanding of systematic effects such as source overlaps, also known as blending. In this work we study how blending introduces a bias in the number counts of galaxies (instead of the flux and colors), and how it propagates into galaxy clustering statistics. We use the $300\,$deg$^2$ DC2 image simulation and its resulting galaxy catalog (LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration et al. 2021) to carry out this study. We find that, for a LSST Year 1 (Y1)-like cosmological analyses, the number count bias due to blending leads to small but statistically significant differences in mean redshift measurements when comparing an observed sample to an unblended calibration sample. In the two-point correlation function, blending causes differences greater than 3$\sigma$ on scales below approximately $10'$, but large scales are unaffected. We fit $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and linear galaxy bias in a Bayesian cosmological analysis and find that the recovered parameters from this limited area sample, with the LSST Y1 scale cuts, are largely unaffected by blending. Our main results hold when considering photometric redshift and a LSST Year 5 (Y5)-like sample.</description>

      <title>Soliton self-gravity and core-halo relation in fuzzy dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) is an attractive dark matter candidate composed of ultralight particles. In this paper, toward a clear understanding of the core-halo relation in the FDM halos, we consider a simple model of the soliton-halo system, in which the self-gravitating soliton core is formed in the presence of Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halo potential as an external field. Solving numerically the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equation, the self-gravitating soliton is obtained as a ground-state solution, which is characterized by the two key parameters, i.e., size of soliton core and its strength of self-gravity relative to those of the NFW halo. Using our soliton-halo model, we investigate the properties of soliton cores found in cosmological simulation, and the key parameters characterizing these solitons are reconstructed in a self-consistent manner. Results suggest that (1) the soliton core properties depend critically on both the self-gravity of the soliton and the external potential of the host halo, and (2) the scatter observed in the core-halo relation cannot be explained solely by the one in the halo's concentration-mass relation, as previously suggested, but also significantly influenced by intrinsic features of the soliton core, potentially arising from local dynamics at the halo center. We also demonstrate that the FDM mass can be reconstructed from the simulation data characterizing the halo density profile, providing a basis for applying the model to observational studies.</description>

      <title>Bayesian "Deep" Process Convolutions: An Application in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear matter power spectrum in cosmology describes how matter density fluctuations vary with scale in the universe, providing critical insights into large-scale structure formation. The matter power spectrum includes both smooth regions and highly oscillatory features. Cosmologists rely on noisy, multi-resolution realizations of large N-body simulations to study these phenomena, which require appropriate smoothing techniques to learn about underlying structures. We introduce a Bayesian Deep Process Convolution (DPC) model that flexibly adapts its smoothness parameter across the input space, enabling it to capture both smooth and variable structure within a single framework. The DPC model leverages common patterns across related functions to improve estimation in regions with sparse data. Compared to existing methods, the DPC model offers superior accuracy and uncertainty quantification in simulated data, and qualitatively superior performance with the cosmological data. This methodology will be useful in cosmology and other fields requiring flexible modeling of smooth nonstationary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Analysis with Calibrated Neural Quantile Estimation and Approximate Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in extracting information from current and upcoming surveys of cosmological Large-Scale Structure (LSS) is the limited availability of computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations. We introduce Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a new Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that leverages a large number of approximate simulations for training and a small number of high-fidelity simulations for calibration. This approach guarantees an unbiased posterior and achieves near-optimal constraining power when the approximate simulations are reasonably accurate. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that cosmological parameters can be inferred at field level from projected 2-dim dark matter density maps up to $k_{\rm max}\sim1.5\,h$/Mpc at $z=0$ by training on $\sim10^4$ Particle-Mesh (PM) simulations with transfer function correction and calibrating with $\sim10^2$ Particle-Particle (PP) simulations. The calibrated posteriors closely match those obtained by directly training on $\sim10^4$ expensive PP simulations, but at a fraction of the computational cost. Our method offers a practical and scalable framework for SBI of cosmological LSS, enabling precise inference across vast volumes and down to small scales.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in the cosmic acceleration inferred from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumption that they are standard(isable) candles, the lightcurves of Type Ia supernovae have been analyzed in the framework of the standard Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology to conclude that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating due to dark energy. While the original claims in the late 1990s were made using overlapping samples of less than 100 supernovae in total, catalogues of nearly 2000 supernovae are now available. In light of recent developments such as the cosmic dipole anomaly and the larger than expected bulk flow in the local Universe (which does not converge to the Cosmic Rest Frame), we analyze the newer datasets using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator and find that the acceleration of the expansion rate of the Universe is unequivocally anisotropic. The associated debate in the literature highlights the artifices of using supernovae as standardisable candles, while also providing deeper insights into a consistent relativistic view of peculiar motions as departures from the Hubble expansion of the Universe. The effects of our being `tilted observers' embedded in a deep bulk flow may have been mistaken for cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Window convolution of the galaxy clustering bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In galaxy survey analysis, the observed clustering statistics do not directly match theoretical predictions but rather have been processed by a window function that arises from the survey geometry including the sky footprint, redshift-dependent background number density and systematic weights. While window convolution of the power spectrum is well studied, for the bispectrum with a larger number of degrees of freedom, it poses a significant numerical and computational challenge. In this work, we consider the effect of the survey window in the tripolar spherical harmonic decomposition of the bispectrum and lay down a formal procedure for their convolution via a series expansion of configuration-space three-point correlation functions, which was first proposed by Sugiyama et al. (2019). We then provide a linear algebra formulation of the full window convolution, where an unwindowed bispectrum model vector can be directly premultiplied by a window matrix specific to each survey geometry. To validate the pipeline, we focus on the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1) luminous red galaxy (LRG) sample in the South Galactic Cap (SGC) in the redshift bin $0.4 \leqslant z \leqslant 0.6$. We first perform convergence checks on the measurement of the window function from discrete random catalogues, and then investigate the convergence of the window convolution series expansion truncated at a finite of number of terms as well as the performance of the window matrix. This work highlights the differences in window convolution between the power spectrum and bispectrum, and provides a streamlined pipeline for the latter for current surveys such as DESI and the Euclid mission.</description>

      <title>Avoiding lensing bias in cosmic shear analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, using the pseudo-$C_\ell$ technique, how to estimate cosmic shear and galaxy-galaxy lensing power spectra that are insensitive to the effects of multiple sources of lensing bias including source-lens clustering, magnification bias and obscuration effects. All of these effects are of significant concern for ongoing and near-future Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. Their common attribute is that they all introduce a cosmological dependence into the selection of the galaxy shear sample. Here, we show how a simple adaptation of the pseudo-$C_\ell$ method can help to suppress these biases to negligible levels in a model-independent way. Our approach is based on making pixelised maps of the shear field and then using a uniform weighting of those shear maps when extracting power spectra. To produce unbiased measurements, the weighting scheme must be independent of the cosmological signal, which makes the commonly-used inverse-variance weighting scheme unsuitable for cosmic shear measurements. We demonstrate this explicitly. A frequently-cited motivation for using inverse-variance weights is to minimize the errors on the resultant power spectra. We find that, for a Stage-IV-like survey configuration, this motivation is not compelling: the precision of power spectra recovered from uniform-weighted maps is only very slightly degraded compared to those recovered from an inverse-variance analysis, and we predict no degradation in cosmological parameter constraints. We suggest that other 2-point statistics, such as real-space correlation functions, can be rendered equally robust to these lensing biases by applying those estimators to pixelised shear maps using a uniform weighting scheme.</description>

      <title>Emulating Recombination with Neural Networks using Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With an aim towards modeling cosmologies beyond the LCDM paradigm, we demonstrate the automatic construction of recombination history emulators while enforcing a prior of causal dynamics. These methods are particularly useful in the current era of precision cosmology, where extremely constraining datasets provide insights into a cosmological model dominated by unknown contents. Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data in particular provide a clean glimpse into the interaction of dark matter, baryons, and radiation in the early Universe, but interpretation of this data requires knowledge of the evolution of the ionization history of the Universe. The exploration of new physics with new CMB data will require fast and flexible calculation of this ionization history. We develop a differentiable machine learning model for recombination physics using a neural network ordinary differential equation model (Universal Differential Equations, UDEs), building towards automatic dimensionality reduction and the avoidance of manual tuning based on cosmological model.</description>

      <title>TOPO: Time-Ordered Provable Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00072v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TOPO (Time-Ordered Provable Outputs), a tool designed to enhance reproducibility and data integrity in astrophysical research, providing a trustless alternative to data analysis blinding. Astrophysical research frequently involves probabilistic algorithms, high computational demands, and stringent data privacy requirements, making it difficult to guarantee the integrity of results. TOPO provides a secure framework for verifying reproducible data analysis while ensuring sensitive information remains hidden. Our approach utilizes deterministic hashing to generate unique digital fingerprints of outputs, and Merkle Trees to store outputs in a time-ordered manner. This enables efficient verification of specific components or the entire dataset while making it computationally infeasible to manipulate results - thereby mitigating the risk of human interference and confirmation bias, key objectives of blinding methods. We demonstrate TOPO's utility in a cosmological context using TOPO-Cobaya, showcasing how blinding and verification can be seamlessly integrated into Markov Chain Monte Carlo calculations, rendering the process cryptographically provable. This method addresses pressing challenges in the reproducibility crisis and offers a robust, verifiable framework for astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Classifying CHIME Fast Radio Bursts and Investigating Empirical Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are highly energetic millisecond-duration astrophysical phenomena typically categorized as repeaters or non-repeaters. However, observational limitations may lead to misclassifications, suggesting a larger proportion of repeaters than currently identified. In this study, we leverage unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify FRBs using data from the CHIME/FRB catalog, including both the first catalog and a recent repeater catalog. By employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms (k-means and HDBSCAN), we successfully segregate repeaters and non-repeaters into distinct clusters, identifying over 100 potential repeater candidates. Our analysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\rm log \,}\Delta t_{sc} - {\rm log \,}T_B$, and $r - \gamma$ correlations, which provide new insights into the physical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying potential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their origins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational data and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <title>AKRA 2.0: Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm for masked shear catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic shear surveys serve as a powerful tool for mapping the underlying matter density field, including non-visible dark matter. A key challenge in cosmic shear surveys is the accurate reconstruction of lensing convergence ($\kappa$) maps from shear catalogs impacted by survey boundaries and masks, which seminal Kaiser-Squires (KS) method are not designed to handle. To overcome these limitations, we previously proposed the Accurate Kappa Reconstruction Algorithm (AKRA), a prior-free maximum likelihood map-making method. Initially designed for flat sky scenarios with periodic boundary conditions, AKRA has proven successful in recovering high-precision $\kappa$ maps from masked shear catalogs. In this work, we upgrade AKRA to AKRA 2.0 by integrating the tools designed for spherical geometry. This upgrade employs spin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms to reconstruct the convergence field over the full sky. To optimize computational efficiency, we implement a scale-splitting strategy that segregates the analysis into two parts: large-scale analysis on the sphere (referred to as AKRA-sphere) and small-scale analysis on the flat sky (referred to as AKRA-flat); the results from both analyses are then combined to produce final reconstructed $\kappa$ map. We tested AKRA 2.0 using simulated shear catalogs with various masks, demonstrating that the reconstructed $\kappa$ map by AKRA 2.0 maintains high accuracy. For the reconstructed $\kappa$ map in unmasked regions, the reconstructed convergence power spectrum $C_\kappa^{\rm{rec}}$ and the correlation coefficient with the true $\kappa$ map $r_\ell$ achieve accuracies of $(1-C_\ell^{\rm{rec}}/C_\ell^{\rm{true}}) \lesssim 1\%$ and $(1-r_\ell) \lesssim 1\%$, respectively. Our algorithm is capable of straightforwardly handling further issues such as inhomogeneous shape measurement noise, which we will address in subsequent analysis.</description>

      <title>Hitting the slopes: A spectroscopic view of UV continuum slopes of galaxies reveals a reddening at z &gt; 9.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The UV continuum slope of galaxies, $\beta$, is a powerful diagnostic. Understanding the redshift evolution of $\beta$ and its dependence on key galaxy properties can shed light on the evolution of galaxy physical properties over cosmic time. In this study, we present $\beta$ measurements for 295 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at $5.5&lt;z&lt;14.3$ selected primarily from JADES, where $\beta$ has been measured from high quality JWST NIRSpec/PRISM spectra. We find a median $\beta=-2.3$ across our full sample, and find mild increase in blueness of $\beta$ with increasing redshift and fainter UV magnitudes. Interestingly, we find evidence for the average $\beta$ at $z &gt; 9.5$ to begin to redden, deviating from the trend observed at $z &lt; 9.5$. By producing stacked spectra in bins of redshift and $\beta$, we derive trends between $\beta$ and dust attenuation, metallicity, ionization parameter, and stellar age indicators directly from spectra, finding a lack of dust attenuation to be the dominant driver of bluer $\beta$ values. We further report six galaxies with $\beta&lt;-3.0$, which show a range of spectroscopic properties and signs of significant LyC photon leakage. Finally, we show that the redder $\beta$ values at $z &gt; 9.5$ may require rapid build-up of dust reservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the nebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular continuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our modeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at $T &gt; 15,000$ K can reproduce the range of $\beta$ that we see in our sample. Higher gas temperatures driven by hot, massive stars can boost the fraction of nebular continuum emission, potentially explaining the observed $\beta$ values as well as bright UV magnitudes seen across galaxies at $z &gt; 10$.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of the beryllium isotopes $^{7}$Be to $^{12}$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic \textit{ab initio} study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^7\text{Be}$ to $^{12}\text{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N$^3$LO interaction. Our calculations achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. Our geometrical analysis reveals prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, and complex nuclear molecular dynamics, underscoring the strong clustering features inherent to beryllium isotopes.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The star-forming properties of HI selected galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between atomic gas, the star-formation history of a galaxy and its environment are intrinsically linked, and we need to decouple these dependencies to understand their role in galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper, we analyse the star formation histories (SFHs) of 187 galaxies from the MIGHTEE-HI Survey Early Science Release data, focusing on the relationships between HI properties and star formation. A strong correlation emerges between a galaxy's HI-to-stellar mass ratio and the time of formation, alongside an inverse correlation between stellar mass and time of formation, regardless of the inferred SFH. Additionally, galaxies with lower stellar masses and higher HI-to-stellar mass ratios exhibit longer gas depletion times compared to more massive galaxies, which appear to have depleted their gas and formed stars more efficiently. This suggests that smaller, gas-rich galaxies have higher depletion times due to shallower potential wells and less efficient star formation. Furthermore, we explore the connection between spin-filament alignment and HI content. We find no significant correlation between peak star formation activity and proximity to filaments. However, we do find that the two galaxies in our sample within 1 Mpc of a filament have very low gas-depletion timescales and have their spin axis misaligned with the filament, suggestive of a link between the galaxy properties and proximity to a filament.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dark Matter Production in Supergravity $\alpha$-Attractor Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitational particle production (GPP) of dark matter (DM) under supergravity framework, where $\alpha$-attractor inflation model is used. The particle spectrum is computed numerically and the dark matter number density is obtained. We show how the dark matter mass, gravitino mass and inflation model parameters modify the results, and find the corresponding reheating temperature which leads to sufficient DM production. In our setup, supergravity corrections suppress the efficiency of GPP, and make the isocurvature constraint much weaker compared with the normal case. With tensor to scalar ratio ranges from $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$, and dark matter mass from $10^{-2} m_\phi - m_\phi$, the required reheating temperature should be around $10^3 \textrm{GeV} - 10^7 \textrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Thermalization effects on the dynamics of growing vacuum bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of growing vacuum bubbles. The bubble walls interact with the surrounding fluid and may, consequently, reach a terminal velocity. If the mean free path of the particles in the fluid is much shorter than the bubble wall thickness, the fluid is locally in thermal equilibrium and the wall's terminal velocity can be determined by entropy conservation. On the other hand, if local thermal equilibrium inside the wall cannot be maintained, the wall velocity can be estimated from the pressure impacted by ballistic particle dynamics at the wall. We find that the latter case leads to slightly slower bubble walls. Expectedly, we find the largest differences in the terminal velocity when the fluid is entirely ballistic. This observation indicates that the non-equilibrium effects inside walls are relevant. To study bubble evolution, we perform hydrodynamic lattice simulations in the case of local thermal equilibrium and $N$-body simulations in the ballistic case to investigate the dynamical effects during expansion. Both simulations show that even if a stationary solution exists in theory it may not be reached depending on the dynamics of the accelerating bubble walls.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical covariance matrices for two-point correlation function for DESI 2024 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03007v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimized way of producing the fast semi-analytical covariance matrices for the Legendre moments of the two-point correlation function, taking into account survey geometry and mimicking the non-Gaussian effects. We validate the approach on simulated (mock) catalogs for different galaxy types, representative of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1, used in 2024 analyses. We find only a few percent differences between the mock sample covariance matrix and our results, which can be expected given the approximate nature of the mocks, although we do identify discrepancies between the shot-noise properties of the DESI fiber assignment algorithm and the faster approximation (emulator) used in the mocks. Importantly, we find a close agreement (&lt;=8% relative differences) in the projected errorbars for distance scale parameters for the baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. This confirms our method as an attractive alternative to simulation-based covariance matrices, especially for non-standard models or galaxy sample selections, making it particularly relevant to the broad current and future analyses of DESI data.</description>

      <title>Absolute reference for microwave polarization experiments -- The COSMOCal project and its proof of concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB), a remnant of the Big Bang, provides unparalleled insights into the primordial universe, its energy content, and the origin of cosmic structures. The success of forthcoming terrestrial and space experiments hinges on meticulously calibrated data. Specifically, the ability to achieve an absolute calibration of the polarization angles with a precision of &lt; 0.1 deg is crucial to identify the signatures of primordial gravitational waves and cosmic birefringence within the CMB polarization. We introduce the COSMOCal project, designed to deploy a polarized source in space for calibrating microwave frequency observations. The project aims to integrate microwave polarization observations from small and large telescopes, ground-based and in space, into a unified scale, enhancing the effectiveness of each observatory and allowing robust combination of data. To demonstrate the feasibility and confirm the observational approach of our project, we developed a prototype instrument that operates in the atmospheric window centered at 260 GHz, specifically tailored for use with the NIKA2 camera at the IRAM 30 m telescope. We present the instrument components and their laboratory characterization. The results of tests performed with the fully assembled prototype using a KIDs-based instrument, similar concept of NIKA2, are also reported. This study paves the way for an observing campaign using the IRAM 30m telescope and contributes to the development of a space-based instrument.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.</description>

      <title>Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Alimi &amp; Koskas have highlighted in $w$CDM models derived from general relativity (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. This paper shows that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different N-body solver and that it is also robust to adding neutrinos to the cold DM component. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in modified gravity models. Thus, we examine whether the invariance observed by Alimi \&amp; Koskas remains robust in the case of Hu &amp; Sawicki models of modified gravity using DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder numerical simulations. By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of $w$CDM models of general relativity (GR). These deviations suggest that the nature of the gravitation significantly influences the shape of the DM halos. We then interpret this deviation observed in the modified gravity models from the GR models as due to the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such $f(R)$-type theories. This one modifies the sphericization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the deviation from cosmological invariance in the shape of DM halos is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>Constraining Primordial Non-Gaussianity with Density-Split Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining tight constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) is a key step in discriminating between different models for cosmic inflation. The constraining power from large-scale structure (LSS) measurements is expected to overtake that from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies with the next generation of galaxy surveys including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and Euclid. We consider whether Density-Split Clustering (DSC) can help improve PNG constraints from these surveys for local, equilateral and orthogonal types. DSC separates a surveyed volume into regions based on local density and measures the clustering statistics within each environment. Using the Quijote simulations and the Fisher information formalism, we compare PNG constraints from the standard halo power spectrum, DSC power spectra and joint halo/DSC power spectra. We find that the joint halo/DSC power spectra outperform the halo power spectrum by factors of $\sim$ 1.4, 8.8, and 3.6 for local, equilateral and orthogonal PNG, respectively. This is driven by the higher-order information that DSC captures on small scales. We find that applying DSC to a halo field does not allow sample variance cancellation on large scales by providing multiple tracers of the same volume with different local PNG responses. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier space analysis for DSC and study the impact of several modifications to the pipeline, such as varying the smoothing radius and the number of density environments and replacing random query positions with lattice points.</description>

      <title>Testing for Intrinsic Type Ia Supernova Luminosity Evolution at z&gt;2 with JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is opening new frontiers of transient discovery and follow-up at high-redshift. Here we present the discovery of a spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernova (SN Ia; SN 2023aeax) at z=2.15 with JWST, with cadenced NIRCam observations that enable multi-band light curve fitting. SN 2023aeax lands at the edge of traditional low-z cosmology color cuts because of its blue color (peak rest-frame B-V~-0.3), but we still apply a fiducial standardization approach with the BayeSN model and find that the SN 2023aeax luminosity distance measurement is in agreement (~0.1sigma) with LambdaCDM. SN 2023aeax is only the second spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia in the dark matter-dominated Universe at z&gt;2 (the other is SN 2023adsy), giving it rare leverage to constrain any potential evolution in SN Ia standardized luminosities. Similar to SN 2023adsy (B-V~0.8), SN 2023aeax has a fairly extreme (but opposite) color, which may be due to the small sample size or a secondary factor, such as host galaxy properties. Nevertheless, the SN 2023aeax spectrum is well-represented by normal low-z SN Ia spectra and we find no definitive evolution in SN Ia standardization with redshift. Still, the first two spectroscopically confirmed z&gt;2 SNe Ia have peculiar colors and combine for a ~1sigma distance slope relative to LambdaCDM, the implications of which require a larger sample and dedicated host galaxy observations to investigate.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter induced event rate in an Earth-based detector is predicted to show an annual modulation as a result of the Earth's orbital motion around the Sun. We searched for this modulation signature using the ionization signal of the DarkSide-50 liquid argon time projection chamber. No significant signature compatible with dark matter is observed in the electron recoil equivalent energy range above $40~{\rm eV_{ee}}$, the lowest threshold ever achieved in such a search.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Kerr-Newman-like Metric Endowed with a Magnetic Dipole and Mass Quadrupole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00270v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate all-terrain spacetimes for astrophysical applications are presented. The metrics possess five relativistic multipole moments, namely mass, rotation, mass quadrupole, charge, and magnetic dipole moment. All these spacetimes approximately satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. The first metric is generated by means of the Hoenselaers-Perj\'es method from given relativistic multipoles. The second metric is a perturbation of the Kerr-Newman metric, which makes it a relevant approximation for astrophysical calculations. The last metric is an extension of the Hartle-Thorne metric that is important for obtaining internal models of compact objects perturbatively. The electromagnetic field is calculated using Cartan forms for locally nonrotating observers. These spacetimes are relevant to infer properties of compact objects from astrophysical observations. Furthermore, the numerical implementations of these metrics are straightforward, making them versatile for simulating the potential astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>ODIN: Identifying Protoclusters and Cosmic Filaments Traced by Ly$\alpha$-emitting Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the formation and evolution of massive cosmic structures, studying them at high redshift, in the epoch when they formed the majority of their mass is essential. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey is undertaking the widest-area narrowband program to date, to use Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) to trace the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe on the scale of 10 - 100 cMpc at three cosmic epochs. In this work, we present results at $z$ = 3.1 based on early ODIN data in the COSMOS field. We identify and characterize protoclusters and cosmic filaments using multiple methods and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We then compare our observations against the IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The two are in excellent agreement, with a similar number and angular size of structures identified above a specified density threshold. We are able to recover the simulated protoclusters with $\log$(M$_{z=0}$/$M_\odot$) $\gtrsim$ 14.4 in $\sim$ 60% of the cases. With these objects we show that the descendant masses of the protoclusters in our sample can be estimated purely based on our 2D measurements, finding a median $z$ = 0 mass of $\sim10^{14.5}$M$_\odot$. The lack of information on the radial extent of each protocluster introduces a $\sim$0.4 dex uncertainty in its descendant mass. Finally, we show that the recovery of the cosmic web in the vicinity of protoclusters is both efficient and accurate. The similarity of our observations and the simulations imply that our structure selection is likewise robust and efficient, demonstrating that LAEs are reliable tracers of the LSS.</description>
