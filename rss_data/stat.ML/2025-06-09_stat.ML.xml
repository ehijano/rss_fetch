      <title>Online Conformal Model Selection for Nonstationary Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the MPS (Model Prediction Set), a novel framework for online model selection for nonstationary time series. Classical model selection methods, such as information criteria and cross-validation, rely heavily on the stationarity assumption and often fail in dynamic environments which undergo gradual or abrupt changes over time. Yet real-world data are rarely stationary, and model selection under nonstationarity remains a largely open problem. To tackle this challenge, we combine conformal inference with model confidence sets to develop a procedure that adaptively selects models best suited to the evolving dynamics at any given time. Concretely, the MPS updates in real time a confidence set of candidate models that covers the best model for the next time period with a specified long-run probability, while adapting to nonstationarity of unknown forms. Through simulations and real-world data analysis, we demonstrate that MPS reliably and efficiently identifies optimal models under nonstationarity, an essential capability lacking in offline methods. Moreover, MPS frequently produces high-quality sets with small cardinality, whose evolution offers deeper insights into changing dynamics. As a generic framework, MPS accommodates any data-generating process, data structure, model class, training method, and evaluation metric, making it broadly applicable across diverse problem settings.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Causal Discovery through a Sequential Edge Orientation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have established the identifiability of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) under additive noise models (ANMs), spurring the development of various causal discovery methods. However, most existing methods make restrictive model assumptions, rely heavily on general independence tests, or require substantial computational time. To address these limitations, we propose a sequential procedure to orient undirected edges in a completed partial DAG (CPDAG), representing an equivalence class of DAGs, by leveraging the pairwise additive noise model (PANM) to identify their causal directions. We prove that this procedure can recover the true causal DAG assuming a restricted ANM. Building on this result, we develop a novel constraint-based algorithm for learning causal DAGs under nonlinear ANMs. Given an estimated CPDAG, we develop a ranking procedure that sorts undirected edges by their adherence to the PANM, which defines an evaluation order of the edges. To determine the edge direction, we devise a statistical test that compares the log-likelihood values, evaluated with respect to the competing directions, of a sub-graph comprising just the candidate nodes and their identified parents in the partial DAG. We further establish the structural learning consistency of our algorithm in the large-sample limit. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is computationally efficient, robust to model misspecification, and consistently outperforms many existing nonlinear DAG learning methods.</description>

      <title>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator. These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational budget.</description>

      <title>Adaptive stable distribution and Hurst exponent by method of moments moving estimator for nonstationary time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonstationarity of real-life time series requires model adaptation. In classical approaches like ARMA-ARCH there is assumed some arbitrarily chosen dependence type. To avoid their bias, we will focus on novel more agnostic approach: moving estimator, which estimates parameters separately for every time $t$: optimizing $F_t=\sum_{\tau&lt;t} (1-\eta)^{t-\tau} \ln(\rho_\theta (x_\tau))$ local log-likelihood with exponentially weakening weights of the old values. In practice such moving estimates can be found by EMA (exponential moving average) of some parameters, like $m_p=E[|x-\mu|^p]$ absolute central moments, updated by $m_{p,t+1} = m_{p,t} + \eta (|x_t-\mu_t|^p-m_{p,t})$. We will focus here on its applications for alpha-Stable distribution, which also influences Hurst exponent, hence can be used for its adaptive estimation. Its application will be shown on financial data as DJIA time series - beside standard estimation of evolution of center $\mu$ and scale parameter $\sigma$, there is also estimated evolution of $\alpha$ parameter allowing to continuously evaluate market stability - tails having $\rho(x) \sim 1/|x|^{\alpha+1}$ behavior, controlling probability of potentially dangerous extreme events.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-Order Optimization Finds Flat Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeroth-order methods are extensively used in machine learning applications where gradients are infeasible or expensive to compute, such as black-box attacks, reinforcement learning, and language model fine-tuning. Existing optimization theory focuses on convergence to an arbitrary stationary point, but less is known on the implicit regularization that provides a fine-grained characterization on which particular solutions are finally reached. We show that zeroth-order optimization with the standard two-point estimator favors solutions with small trace of Hessian, which is widely used in previous work to distinguish between sharp and flat minima. We further provide convergence rates of zeroth-order optimization to approximate flat minima for convex and sufficiently smooth functions, where flat minima are defined as the minimizers that achieve the smallest trace of Hessian among all optimal solutions. Experiments on binary classification tasks with convex losses and language model fine-tuning support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>The Generative Leap: Sharp Sample Complexity for Efficiently Learning Gaussian Multi-Index Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider generic Gaussian Multi-index models, in which the labels only depend on the (Gaussian) $d$-dimensional inputs through their projection onto a low-dimensional $r = O_d(1)$ subspace, and we study efficient agnostic estimation procedures for this hidden subspace. We introduce the \emph{generative leap} exponent $k^\star$, a natural extension of the generative exponent from [Damian et al.'24] to the multi-index setting. We first show that a sample complexity of $n=\Theta(d^{1 \vee \k/2})$ is necessary in the class of algorithms captured by the Low-Degree-Polynomial framework. We then establish that this sample complexity is also sufficient, by giving an agnostic sequential estimation procedure (that is, requiring no prior knowledge of the multi-index model) based on a spectral U-statistic over appropriate Hermite tensors. We further compute the generative leap exponent for several examples including piecewise linear functions (deep ReLU networks with bias), and general deep neural networks (with $r$-dimensional first hidden layer).</description>

      <title>Winner-takes-all for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TimeMCL, a method leveraging the Multiple Choice Learning (MCL) paradigm to forecast multiple plausible time series futures. Our approach employs a neural network with multiple heads and utilizes the Winner-Takes-All (WTA) loss to promote diversity among predictions. MCL has recently gained attention due to its simplicity and ability to address ill-posed and ambiguous tasks. We propose an adaptation of this framework for time-series forecasting, presenting it as an efficient method to predict diverse futures, which we relate to its implicit quantization objective. We provide insights into our approach using synthetic data and evaluate it on real-world time series, demonstrating its promising performance at a light computational cost.</description>

      <title>On Fitting Flow Models with Large Sinkhorn Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow models transform data gradually from one modality (e.g. noise) onto another (e.g. images). Such models are parameterized by a time-dependent velocity field, trained to fit segments connecting pairs of source and target points. When the pairing between source and target points is given, training flow models boils down to a supervised regression problem. When no such pairing exists, as is the case when generating data from noise, training flows is much harder. A popular approach lies in picking source and target points independently. This can, however, lead to velocity fields that are slow to train, but also costly to integrate at inference time. In theory, one would greatly benefit from training flow models by sampling pairs from an optimal transport (OT) measure coupling source and target, since this would lead to a highly efficient flow solving the Benamou and Brenier dynamical OT problem. In practice, recent works have proposed to sample mini-batches of $n$ source and $n$ target points and reorder them using an OT solver to form better pairs. These works have advocated using batches of size $n\approx 256$, and considered OT solvers that return couplings that are either sharp (using e.g. the Hungarian algorithm) or blurred (using e.g. entropic regularization, a.k.a. Sinkhorn). We follow in the footsteps of these works by exploring the benefits of increasing $n$ by three to four orders of magnitude, and look more carefully on the effect of the entropic regularization $\varepsilon$ used in the Sinkhorn algorithm. Our analysis is facilitated by new scale invariant quantities to report the sharpness of a coupling, while our sharded computations across multiple GPU or GPU nodes allow scaling up $n$. We show that in both synthetic and image generation tasks, flow models greatly benefit when fitted with large Sinkhorn couplings, with a low entropic regularization $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Testing Hypotheses of Covariate Effects on Topics of Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an approach to topic modelling with document-level covariates that remains tractable in the face of large text corpora. This is achieved by de-emphasizing the role of parameter estimation in an underlying probabilistic model, assuming instead that the data come from a fixed but unknown distribution whose statistical functionals are of interest. We propose combining a convex formulation of non-negative matrix factorization with standard regression techniques as a fast-to-compute and useful estimate of such a functional. Uncertainty quantification can then be achieved by reposing non-parametric resampling methods on top of this scheme. This is in contrast to popular topic modelling paradigms, which posit a complex and often hard-to-fit generative model of the data. We argue that the simple, non-parametric approach advocated here is faster, more interpretable, and enjoys better inferential justification than said generative models. Finally, our methods are demonstrated with an application analysing covariate effects on discourse of flavours attributed to Canadian beers.</description>

      <title>When can in-context learning generalize out of task distribution?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a remarkable capability of pretrained transformers that allows models to generalize to unseen tasks after seeing only a few examples. We investigate empirically the conditions necessary on the pretraining distribution for ICL to emerge and generalize \emph{out-of-distribution}. Previous work has focused on the number of distinct tasks necessary in the pretraining dataset. Here, we use a different notion of task diversity to study the emergence of ICL in transformers trained on linear functions. We find that as task diversity increases, transformers undergo a transition from a specialized solution, which exhibits ICL only within the pretraining task distribution, to a solution which generalizes out of distribution to the entire task space. We also investigate the nature of the solutions learned by the transformer on both sides of the transition, and observe similar transitions in nonlinear regression problems. We construct a phase diagram to characterize how our concept of task diversity interacts with the number of pretraining tasks. In addition, we explore how factors such as the depth of the model and the dimensionality of the regression problem influence the transition.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction Adaptive to Unknown Subpopulation Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is widely used to equip black-box machine learning models with uncertainty quantification enjoying formal coverage guarantees. However, these guarantees typically break down in the presence of distribution shifts, where the data distribution at test time differs from the training (or calibration-time) distribution. In this work, we address subpopulation shifts, where the test environment exhibits an unknown and differing mixture of subpopulations compared to the calibration data. We propose new methods that provably adapt conformal prediction to such shifts, ensuring valid coverage without requiring explicit knowledge of subpopulation structure. Our algorithms scale to high-dimensional settings and perform effectively in realistic machine learning tasks. Extensive experiments on vision (with vision transformers) and language (with large language models) benchmarks demonstrate that our methods reliably maintain coverage and controls risk in scenarios where standard conformal prediction fails.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot protein stability prediction by inverse folding models: a free energy interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse folding models have proven to be highly effective zero-shot predictors of protein stability. Despite this success, the link between the amino acid preferences of an inverse folding model and the free-energy considerations underlying thermodynamic stability remains incompletely understood. A better understanding would be of interest not only from a theoretical perspective, but also potentially provide the basis for stronger zero-shot stability prediction. In this paper, we take steps to clarify the free-energy foundations of inverse folding models. Our derivation reveals the standard practice of likelihood ratios as a simplistic approximation and suggests several paths towards better estimates of the relative stability. We empirically assess these approaches and demonstrate that considerable gains in zero-shot performance can be achieved with fairly simple means.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Radon-Nikodym Estimator (RNE), a flexible, plug-and-play framework for diffusion inference-time density estimation and control, based on the concept of the density ratio between path distributions. RNE connects and unifies a variety of existing density estimation and inference-time control methods under a single and intuitive perspective, stemming from basic variational inference and probabilistic principles therefore offering both theoretical clarity and practical versatility. Experiments demonstrate that RNE achieves promising performances in diffusion density estimation and inference-time control tasks, including annealing, composition of diffusion models, and reward-tilting.</description>

      <title>Grokking Beyond the Euclidean Norm of Model Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grokking refers to a delayed generalization following overfitting when optimizing artificial neural networks with gradient-based methods. In this work, we demonstrate that grokking can be induced by regularization, either explicit or implicit. More precisely, we show that when there exists a model with a property $P$ (e.g., sparse or low-rank weights) that generalizes on the problem of interest, gradient descent with a small but non-zero regularization of $P$ (e.g., $\ell_1$ or nuclear norm regularization) results in grokking. This extends previous work showing that small non-zero weight decay induces grokking. Moreover, our analysis shows that over-parameterization by adding depth makes it possible to grok or ungrok without explicitly using regularization, which is impossible in shallow cases. We further show that the $\ell_2$ norm is not a reliable proxy for generalization when the model is regularized toward a different property $P$, as the $\ell_2$ norm grows in many cases where no weight decay is used, but the model generalizes anyway. We also show that grokking can be amplified solely through data selection, with any other hyperparameter fixed.</description>

Abstract: A phenomenon known as ''Neural Collapse (NC)'' in deep classification tasks, in which the penultimate-layer features and the final classifiers exhibit an extremely simple geometric structure, has recently attracted considerable attention, with the expectation that it can deepen our understanding of how deep neural networks behave. The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been proposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work that extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for practical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar phenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the cumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal Neural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following three properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to their within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class means align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a one-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to logits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the class order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly local and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables and the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM framework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a variety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR, highlighting the use of fixed thresholds.</description>

      <title>Optimized projection-free algorithms for online learning: construction and worst-case analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies and develop projection-free algorithms for online learning with linear optimization oracles (a.k.a. Frank-Wolfe) for handling the constraint set. More precisely, this work (i) provides an improved (optimized) variant of an online Frank-Wolfe algorithm along with its conceptually simple potential-based proof, and (ii) shows how to leverage semidefinite programming to jointly design and analyze online Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms numerically in a variety of settings-that include the design of the variant (i). Based on the semidefinite technique, we conclude with strong numerical evidence suggesting that no pure online Frank-Wolfe algorithm within our model class can have a regret guarantee better than O(T^3/4) (T is the time horizon) without additional assumptions, that the current algorithms do not have optimal constants, that the algorithm benefits from similar anytime properties O(t^3/4) not requiring to know T in advance, and that multiple linear optimization rounds do not generally help to obtain better regret bounds.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Quantum HyperNetworks</title>

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BiNNs), which employ single-bit precision weights, have emerged as a promising solution to reduce memory usage and power consumption while maintaining competitive performance in large-scale systems. However, training BiNNs remains a significant challenge due to the limitations of conventional training algorithms. Quantum HyperNetworks offer a novel paradigm for enhancing the optimization of BiNN by leveraging quantum computing. Specifically, a Variational Quantum Algorithm is employed to generate binary weights through quantum circuit measurements, while key quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement facilitate the exploration of a broader solution space. In this work, we establish a connection between this approach and Bayesian inference by deriving the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), when direct access to the output distribution is available (i.e., in simulations), and introducing a surrogate ELBO based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric for scenarios involving implicit distributions, as commonly encountered in practice. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), improving trainability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Sequential Monte Carlo approximations of Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao gradient flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a probability distribution $\pi$. It is well known that this can be written as an optimisation problem over the space of probability distribution in which we aim to minimise the Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$. We consider several partial differential equations (PDEs) whose solution is a minimiser of the Kullback--Leibler divergence from $\pi$ and connect them to well-known Monte Carlo algorithms. We focus in particular on PDEs obtained by considering the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao geometry over the space of probabilities and show that these lead to a natural implementation using importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo. We propose a novel algorithm to approximate the Wasserstein--Fisher--Rao flow of the Kullback--Leibler divergence which empirically outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
  We study tempered versions of these PDEs obtained by replacing the target distribution with a geometric mixture of initial and target distribution and show that these do not lead to a convergence speed up.</description>

      <title>On Efficient Estimation of Distributional Treatment Effects under Covariate-Adaptive Randomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the estimation of distributional treatment effects in randomized experiments that use covariate-adaptive randomization (CAR). These include designs such as Efron's biased-coin design and stratified block randomization, where participants are first grouped into strata based on baseline covariates and assigned treatments within each stratum to ensure balance across groups. In practice, datasets often contain additional covariates beyond the strata indicators. We propose a flexible distribution regression framework that leverages off-the-shelf machine learning methods to incorporate these additional covariates, enhancing the precision of distributional treatment effect estimates. We establish the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator and introduce a valid inference procedure. Furthermore, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound for distributional treatment effects under CAR and demonstrate that our regression-adjusted estimator attains this bound. Simulation studies and empirical analyses of microcredit programs highlight the practical advantages of our method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based hypothesis tests offer a flexible, non-parametric tool to detect high-order interactions in multivariate data, beyond pairwise relationships. Yet the scalability of such tests is limited by the computationally demanding permutation schemes used to generate null approximations. Here we introduce a family of permutation-free high-order tests for joint independence and partial factorisations of $d$ variables. Our tests eliminate the need for permutation-based approximations by leveraging V-statistics and a novel cross-centring technique to yield test statistics with a standard normal limiting distribution under the null. We present implementations of the tests and showcase their efficacy and scalability through synthetic datasets. We also show applications inspired by causal discovery and feature selection, which highlight both the importance of high-order interactions in data and the need for efficient computational methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reward modelling from preference data is a crucial step in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values, requiring robust generalisation to novel prompt-response pairs. In this work, we propose to frame this problem in a causal paradigm, providing the rich toolbox of causality to identify the persistent challenges, such as causal misidentification, preference heterogeneity, and confounding due to user-specific factors. Inheriting from the literature of causal inference, we identify key assumptions necessary for reliable generalisation and contrast them with common data collection practices. We illustrate failure modes of naive reward models and demonstrate how causally-inspired approaches can improve model robustness. Finally, we outline desiderata for future research and practices, advocating targeted interventions to address inherent limitations of observational data.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Study of (Hyper) Self-Attention through the Lens of Interactions: Representation, Training, Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-attention has emerged as a core component of modern neural architectures, yet its theoretical underpinnings remain elusive. In this paper, we study self-attention through the lens of interacting entities, ranging from agents in multi-agent reinforcement learning to alleles in genetic sequences, and show that a single layer linear self-attention can efficiently represent, learn, and generalize functions capturing pairwise interactions, including out-of-distribution scenarios. Our analysis reveals that self-attention acts as a mutual interaction learner under minimal assumptions on the diversity of interaction patterns observed during training, thereby encompassing a wide variety of real-world domains. In addition, we validate our theoretical insights through experiments demonstrating that self-attention learns interaction functions and generalizes across both population distributions and out-of-distribution scenarios. Building on our theories, we introduce HyperFeatureAttention, a novel neural network module designed to learn couplings of different feature-level interactions between entities. Furthermore, we propose HyperAttention, a new module that extends beyond pairwise interactions to capture multi-entity dependencies, such as three-way, four-way, or general n-way interactions.</description>

      <title>Antithetic Noise in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of antithetic initial noise in diffusion models. Across unconditional models trained on diverse datasets, text-conditioned latent-diffusion models, and diffusion-posterior samplers, we find that pairing each initial noise with its negation consistently yields strongly negatively correlated samples. To explain this phenomenon, we combine experiments and theoretical analysis, leading to a symmetry conjecture that the learned score function is approximately affine antisymmetric (odd symmetry up to a constant shift), and provide evidence supporting it. Leveraging this negative correlation, we enable two applications: (1) enhancing image diversity in models like Stable Diffusion without quality loss, and (2) sharpening uncertainty quantification (e.g., up to 90% narrower confidence intervals) when estimating downstream statistics. Building on these gains, we extend the two-point pairing to a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimator, which further improves estimation accuracy. Our framework is training-free, model-agnostic, and adds no runtime overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups, particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g., statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g., predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics} provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database (Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).</description>

      <title>An Optimized Franz-Parisi Criterion and its Equivalence with SQ Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandeira et al. (2022) introduced the Franz-Parisi (FP) criterion for characterizing the computational hard phases in statistical detection problems. The FP criterion, based on an annealed version of the celebrated Franz-Parisi potential from statistical physics, was shown to be equivalent to low-degree polynomial (LDP) lower bounds for Gaussian additive models, thereby connecting two distinct approaches to understanding the computational hardness in statistical inference. In this paper, we propose a refined FP criterion that aims to better capture the geometric ``overlap" structure of statistical models. Our main result establishes that this optimized FP criterion is equivalent to Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds -- another foundational framework in computational complexity of statistical inference. Crucially, this equivalence holds under a mild, verifiable assumption satisfied by a broad class of statistical models, including Gaussian additive models, planted sparse models, as well as non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA), single-index (SI) models, and convex truncation detection settings. For instance, in the case of convex truncation tasks, the assumption is equivalent with the Gaussian correlation inequality (Royen, 2014) from convex geometry.
  In addition to the above, our equivalence not only unifies and simplifies the derivation of several known SQ lower bounds -- such as for the NGCA model (Diakonikolas et al., 2017) and the SI model (Damian et al., 2024) -- but also yields new SQ lower bounds of independent interest, including for the computational gaps in mixed sparse linear regression (Arpino et al., 2023) and convex truncation (De et al., 2023).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models have had a profound impact on many application areas, including those where data are intrinsically infinite-dimensional, such as images or time series. The standard approach is first to discretize and then to apply diffusion models to the discretized data. While such approaches are practically appealing, the performance of the resulting algorithms typically deteriorates as discretization parameters are refined. In this paper, we instead directly formulate diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions and apply them to the generative modelling of functions. We prove that our formulations are well posed in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide dimension-independent distance bounds from the sample to the target measure. Using our theory, we also develop guidelines for the design of infinite-dimensional diffusion models. For image distributions, these guidelines are in line with current canonical choices. For other distributions, however, we can improve upon these canonical choices. We demonstrate these results both theoretically and empirically, by applying the algorithms to data distributions on manifolds and to distributions arising in Bayesian inverse problems or simulation-based inference.</description>

      <title>MCMC-Correction of Score-Based Diffusion Models for Model Composition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models can be parameterized in terms of either a score or an energy function. The energy parameterization is attractive as it enables sampling procedures such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that incorporates a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) correction step based on energy differences between proposed samples. Such corrections can significantly improve sampling quality, particularly in the context of model composition, where pre-trained models are combined to generate samples from novel distributions. Score-based diffusion models, on the other hand, are more widely adopted and come with a rich ecosystem of pre-trained models. However, they do not, in general, define an underlying energy function, making MH-based sampling inapplicable. In this work, we address this limitation by retaining the score parameterization and introducing a novel MH-like acceptance rule based on line integration of the score function. This allows the reuse of existing diffusion models while still combining the reverse process with various MCMC techniques, viewed as an instance of annealed MCMC. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we show that our MH-like samplers offer comparable improvements to those obtained with energy-based models, without requiring explicit energy parameterization.</description>

      <title>Do we need rebalancing strategies? A theoretical and empirical study around SMOTE and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03819v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a common rebalancing strategy for handling imbalanced tabular data sets. However, few works analyze SMOTE theoretically. In this paper, we derive several non-asymptotic upper bound on SMOTE density. From these results, we prove that SMOTE (with default parameter) tends to copy the original minority samples asymptotically. We confirm and illustrate empirically this first theoretical behavior on a real-world data-set.bFurthermore, we prove that SMOTE density vanishes near the boundary of the support of the minority class distribution. We then adapt SMOTE based on our theoretical findings to introduce two new variants. These strategies are compared on 13 tabular data sets with 10 state-of-the-art rebalancing procedures, including deep generative and diffusion models. One of our key findings is that, for most data sets, applying no rebalancing strategy is competitive in terms of predictive performances, would it be with LightGBM, tuned random forests or logistic regression. However, when the imbalance ratio is artificially augmented, one of our two modifications of SMOTE leads to promising predictive performances compared to SMOTE and other state-of-the-art strategies.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation with Temporal-Difference Heterogeneous Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Deep Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (Deep LTMLE), a novel approach to estimate the counterfactual mean of outcome under dynamic treatment policies in longitudinal problem settings. Our approach utilizes a transformer architecture with heterogeneous type embedding trained using temporal-difference learning. After obtaining an initial estimate using the transformer, following the targeted minimum loss-based likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework, we statistically corrected for the bias commonly associated with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our method also facilitates statistical inference by enabling the provision of 95% confidence intervals grounded in asymptotic statistical theory. Simulation results demonstrate our method's superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators. To demonstrate our method in practice, we applied our method to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes for standard versus intensive blood pressure management strategies in a real-world cardiovascular epidemiology cohort study.</description>

      <title>BOLD: Boolean Logic Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Deep learning is computationally intensive, with significant efforts focused on reducing arithmetic complexity, particularly regarding energy consumption dominated by data movement. While existing literature emphasizes inference, training is considerably more resource-intensive. This paper proposes a novel mathematical principle by introducing the notion of Boolean variation such that neurons made of Boolean weights and inputs can be trained -- for the first time -- efficiently in Boolean domain using Boolean logic instead of gradient descent and real arithmetic. We explore its convergence, conduct extensively experimental benchmarking, and provide consistent complexity evaluation by considering chip architecture, memory hierarchy, dataflow, and arithmetic precision. Our approach achieves baseline full-precision accuracy in ImageNet classification and surpasses state-of-the-art results in semantic segmentation, with notable performance in image super-resolution, and natural language understanding with transformer-based models. Moreover, it significantly reduces energy consumption during both training and inference.</description>

      <title>Adjusting Model Size in Continual Gaussian Processes: How Big is Big Enough?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07588v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many machine learning models require setting a parameter that controls their size before training, e.g. number of neurons in DNNs, or inducing points in GPs. Increasing capacity typically improves performance until all the information from the dataset is captured. After this point, computational cost keeps increasing, without improved performance. This leads to the question "How big is big enough?" We investigate this problem for Gaussian processes (single-layer neural networks) in continual learning. Here, data becomes available incrementally, and the final dataset size will therefore not be known before training, preventing the use of heuristics for setting a fixed model size. We develop a method to automatically adjust model size while maintaining near-optimal performance. Our experimental procedure follows the constraint that any hyperparameters must be set without seeing dataset properties, and we show that our method performs well across diverse datasets without the need to adjust its hyperparameter, showing it requires less tuning than others.</description>

      <title>Deconfounding Multi-Cause Latent Confounders: A Factor-Model Approach to Climate Model Bias Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global Climate Models (GCMs) are crucial for predicting future climate changes by simulating the Earth systems. However, the GCM Outputs exhibit systematic biases due to model uncertainties, parameterization simplifications, and inadequate representation of complex climate phenomena. Traditional bias correction methods, which rely on historical observation data and statistical techniques, often neglect unobserved confounders, leading to biased results. This paper proposes a novel bias correction approach to utilize both GCM and observational data to learn a factor model that captures multi-cause latent confounders. Inspired by recent advances in causality based time series deconfounding, our method first constructs a factor model to learn latent confounders from historical data and then applies them to enhance the bias correction process using advanced time series forecasting models. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of precipitation outputs. By addressing unobserved confounders, our approach offers a robust and theoretically grounded solution for climate model bias correction.</description>

      <title>Non-convex matrix sensing: Breaking the quadratic rank barrier in the sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13276v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements, two classes of algorithms have been widely studied in the literature: convex approaches based on nuclear norm minimization, and non-convex approaches that use factorized gradient descent. Under certain statistical model assumptions, it is known that nuclear norm minimization recovers the ground truth as soon as the number of samples scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom of the ground truth. In contrast, while non-convex approaches are computationally less expensive, existing recovery guarantees assume that the number of samples scales at least quadratically with the rank $r$ of the ground-truth matrix. In this paper, we close this gap by showing that the non-convex approaches can be as efficient as nuclear norm minimization in terms of sample complexity. Namely, we consider the problem of reconstructing a positive semidefinite matrix from a few Gaussian measurements. We show that factorized gradient descent with spectral initialization converges to the ground truth with a linear rate as soon as the number of samples scales with $ \Omega (rd\kappa^2)$, where $d$ is the dimension, and $\kappa$ is the condition number of the ground truth matrix. This improves the previous rank-dependence in the sample complexity of non-convex matrix factorization from quadratic to linear. Our proof relies on a probabilistic decoupling argument, where we show that the gradient descent iterates are only weakly dependent on the individual entries of the measurement matrices. We expect that our proof technique is of independent interest for other non-convex problems.</description>

      <title>Distributional Matrix Completion via Nearest Neighbors in the Wasserstein Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of distributional matrix completion: Given a sparsely observed matrix of empirical distributions, we seek to impute the true distributions associated with both observed and unobserved matrix entries. This is a generalization of traditional matrix completion, where the observations per matrix entry are scalar-valued. To do so, we utilize tools from optimal transport to generalize the nearest neighbors method to the distributional setting. Under a suitable latent factor model on probability distributions, we establish that our method recovers the distributions in the Wasserstein metric. We demonstrate through simulations that our method (i) provides better distributional estimates for an entry compared to using observed samples for that entry alone, (ii) yields accurate estimates of distributional quantities such as standard deviation and value-at-risk, and (iii) inherently supports heteroscedastic distributions. In addition, we demonstrate our method on a real-world dataset of quarterly earnings prediction distributions. We also prove novel asymptotic results for Wasserstein barycenters over one-dimensional distributions.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Nonparametric Variable Selection for Scalable Symbolic Regression with Large $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering symbolic expressions that characterize nonlinear relationships in data, gaining increasing attention for its interpretability, compactness, and robustness. However, existing SR methods do not scale to datasets with a large number of input variables (referred to as extreme-scale SR), which is common in modern scientific applications. This ``large $p$'' setting, often accompanied by measurement error, leads to slow performance of SR methods and overly complex expressions that are difficult to interpret. To address this scalability challenge, we propose a method called PAN+SR, which combines a key idea of ab initio nonparametric variable selection with SR to efficiently pre-screen large input spaces and reduce search complexity while maintaining accuracy. The use of nonparametric methods eliminates model misspecification, supporting a strategy called parametric-assisted nonparametric (PAN). We also extend SRBench, an open-source benchmarking platform, by incorporating high-dimensional regression problems with various signal-to-noise ratios. Our results demonstrate that PAN+SR consistently enhances the performance of 19 contemporary SR methods, enabling several to achieve state-of-the-art performance on these challenging datasets.</description>

      <title>SDE Matching: Scalable and Simulation-Free Training of Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Latent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) is a powerful tool for time series and sequence modeling. However, training Latent SDEs typically relies on adjoint sensitivity methods, which depend on simulation and backpropagation through approximate SDE solutions, which limit scalability. In this work, we propose SDE Matching, a new simulation-free method for training Latent SDEs. Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative dynamics, we extend these ideas to the domain of stochastic dynamics for time series and sequence modeling, eliminating the need for costly numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate that SDE Matching achieves performance comparable to adjoint sensitivity methods while drastically reducing computational complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Denoising diffusions sample from a probability distribution $\mu$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ by constructing a stochastic process $({\hat{\boldsymbol x}}_t:t\ge 0)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ such that ${\hat{\boldsymbol x}}_0$ is easy to sample, but the distribution of $\hat{\boldsymbol x}_T$ at large $T$ approximates $\mu$. The drift ${\boldsymbol m}:\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}^d$ of this diffusion process is learned my minimizing a score-matching objective.
  Is every probability distribution $\mu$, for which sampling is tractable, also amenable to sampling via diffusions? We provide evidence to the contrary by studying a probability distribution $\mu$ for which sampling is easy, but the drift of the diffusion process is intractable -- under a popular conjecture on information-computation gaps in statistical estimation. We show that there exist drifts that are superpolynomially close to the optimum value (among polynomial time drifts) and yet yield samples with distribution that is very far from the target one.</description>

      <title>Estimating stationary mass, frequency by frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we observe a trajectory of length $n$ from an exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic process over a finite but potentially large state space. We consider the problem of estimating the probability mass placed by the stationary distribution of any such process on elements that occur with a certain frequency in the observed sequence. We estimate this vector of probabilities in total variation distance, showing universal consistency in $n$ and recovering known results for i.i.d. sequences as special cases. Our proposed methodology -- implementable in linear time -- carefully combines the plug-in (or empirical) estimator with a recently-proposed modification of the Good--Turing estimator called WingIt, which was originally developed for Markovian sequences. En route to controlling the error of our estimator, we develop new performance bounds on WingIt and the plug-in estimator for exponentially $\alpha$-mixing stochastic processes. Importantly, the extensively used method of Poissonization can no longer be applied in our non i.i.d. setting, and so we develop complementary tools -- including concentration inequalities for a natural self-normalized statistic of mixing sequences -- that may prove independently useful in the design and analysis of estimators for related problems. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Conditioning Diffusions Using Malliavin Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In generative modelling and stochastic optimal control, a central computational task is to modify a reference diffusion process to maximise a given terminal-time reward. Most existing methods require this reward to be differentiable, using gradients to steer the diffusion towards favourable outcomes. However, in many practical settings, like diffusion bridges, the reward is singular, taking an infinite value if the target is hit and zero otherwise. We introduce a novel framework, based on Malliavin calculus and centred around a generalisation of the Tweedie score formula to nonlinear stochastic differential equations, that enables the development of methods robust to such singularities. This allows our approach to handle a broad range of applications, like diffusion bridges, or adding conditional controls to an already trained diffusion model. We demonstrate that our approach offers stable and reliable training, outperforming existing techniques. As a byproduct, we also introduce a novel score matching objective. Our loss functions are formulated such that they could readily be extended to manifold-valued and infinite dimensional diffusions.</description>

Abstract: We introduce kernel density machines (KDM), a nonparametric estimator of a Radon--Nikodym derivative, based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. KDM applies to general probability measures on countably generated measurable spaces under minimal assumptions. For computational efficiency, we incorporate a low-rank approximation with precisely controlled error that grants scalability to large-sample settings. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and finite-sample error bounds, establishing a strong foundation for practical use. Empirical results based on simulated and real data demonstrate the efficacy and precision of KDM.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates causal effect identification in latent variable Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Models (lvLiNGAM) using higher-order cumulants, addressing two prominent setups that are challenging in the presence of latent confounding: (1) a single proxy variable that may causally influence the treatment and (2) underspecified instrumental variable cases where fewer instruments exist than treatments. We prove that causal effects are identifiable with a single proxy or instrument and provide corresponding estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our approaches compared to existing methods, advancing the theoretical and practical understanding of causal inference in linear systems with latent confounders.</description>

Abstract: Active learning of Gaussian process (GP) surrogates has been useful for optimizing experimental designs for physical/computer simulation experiments, and for steering data acquisition schemes in machine learning. In this paper, we develop a method for active learning of piecewise, Jump GP surrogates. Jump GPs are continuous within, but discontinuous across, regions of a design space, as required for applications spanning autonomous materials design, configuration of smart factory systems, and many others. Although our active learning heuristics are appropriated from strategies originally designed for ordinary GPs, we demonstrate that additionally accounting for model bias, as opposed to the usual model uncertainty, is essential in the Jump GP context. Toward that end, we develop an estimator for bias and variance of Jump GP models. Illustrations, and evidence of the advantage of our proposed methods, are provided on a suite of synthetic benchmarks, and real-simulation experiments of varying complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new class of fast Krasnoselkii--Mann methods with variance reduction to solve a finite-sum co-coercive equation $Gx = 0$. Our algorithm is single-loop and leverages a new family of unbiased variance-reduced estimators specifically designed for a wider class of root-finding algorithms. Our method achieves both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ last-iterate convergence rates in terms of $\mathbb{E}[\| Gx^k\|^2]$, where $k$ is the iteration counter and $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ is the total expectation. We also establish almost sure $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates $\{x^k\}$ to a solution of $Gx=0$. We instantiate our framework for two prominent estimators: SVRG and SAGA. By an appropriate choice of parameters, both variants attain an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n + n^{2/3}\epsilon^{-1})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-solution, where $n$ represents the number of summands in the finite-sum operator $G$. Furthermore, under $\sigma$-strong quasi-monotonicity, our method achieves a linear convergence rate and an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+ \max\{n, n^{2/3}\kappa\} \log(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$, where $\kappa := L/\sigma$. We extend our approach to solve a class of finite-sum inclusions (possibly nonmonotone), demonstrating that our schemes retain the same theoretical guarantees as in the equation setting. Finally, numerical experiments validate our algorithms and demonstrate their promising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Computational Limits of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Fine-Tuning for Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the computational limits of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for finetuning transformer-based models using fine-grained complexity theory. Our key observation is that the existence of low-rank decompositions within the gradient computation of LoRA adaptation leads to possible algorithmic speedup. This allows us to (i) identify a phase transition behavior of efficiency assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH), and (ii) prove the existence of almost linear algorithms by controlling the LoRA update computation term by term. For the former, we identify a sharp transition in the efficiency of all possible rank-$r$ LoRA update algorithms for transformers, based on specific norms resulting from the multiplications of the input sequence $X$, pretrained weights ${W^\star}$, and adapter matrices $\alpha B A/r$. Specifically, we derive a shared upper bound threshold for such norms, and show that efficient (sub-quadratic) approximation algorithms of LoRA exist only below this threshold. For the latter, we prove the existence of almost linear approximation algorithms for LoRA adaptation by utilizing the hierarchical low-rank structures of LoRA gradients and approximating the gradients with a series of chained low-rank approximations. To showcase our theory, we consider two practical scenarios: partial (e.g., only $W_V$ and $W_Q$) and full adaptations (e.g., $W_Q$, $W_V$, and $W_K$) of weights in attention heads.</description>

      <title>Provable Complexity Improvement of AdaGrad over SGD: Upper and Lower Bounds in Stochastic Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods, such as AdaGrad, are among the most successful optimization algorithms for neural network training. While these methods are known to achieve better dimensional dependence than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for stochastic convex optimization under favorable geometry, the theoretical justification for their success in stochastic non-convex optimization remains elusive. In fact, under standard assumptions of Lipschitz gradients and bounded noise variance, it is known that SGD is worst-case optimal in terms of finding a near-stationary point with respect to the $l_2$-norm, making further improvements impossible. Motivated by this limitation, we introduce refined assumptions on the smoothness structure of the objective and the gradient noise variance, which better suit the coordinate-wise nature of adaptive gradient methods. Moreover, we adopt the $l_1$-norm of the gradient as the stationarity measure, as opposed to the standard $l_2$-norm, to align with the coordinate-wise analysis and obtain tighter convergence guarantees for AdaGrad. Under these new assumptions and the $l_1$-norm stationarity measure, we establish an upper bound on the convergence rate of AdaGrad and a corresponding lower bound for SGD. In particular, we identify non-convex settings in which the iteration complexity of AdaGrad is favorable over SGD and show that, for certain configurations of problem parameters, it outperforms SGD by a factor of $d$, where $d$ is the problem dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result to demonstrate a provable gain of adaptive gradient methods over SGD in a non-convex setting. We also present supporting lower bounds, including one specific to AdaGrad and one applicable to general deterministic first-order methods, showing that our upper bound for AdaGrad is tight and unimprovable up to a logarithmic factor under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Medical Knowledge Integration into Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of precision medicine is to provide individualized treatment at each stage of chronic diseases, a concept formalized by Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTR). These regimes adapt treatment strategies based on decision rules learned from clinical data to enhance therapeutic effectiveness. Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms allow to determine these decision rules conditioned by individual patient data and their medical history. The integration of medical expertise into these models makes possible to increase confidence in treatment recommendations and facilitate the adoption of this approach by healthcare professionals and patients. In this work, we examine the mathematical foundations of RL, contextualize its application in the field of DTR, and present an overview of methods to improve its effectiveness by integrating medical expertise.</description>

      <title>Learning Time-Varying Multi-Region Communications via Scalable Markovian Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00397v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and constructing brain communications that capture dynamic communications across multiple regions is fundamental to modern system neuroscience, yet current methods struggle to find time-varying region-level communications or scale to large neural datasets with long recording durations. We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Generalization with Gaussian Mixture Model Based Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08638v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in tasks like node and graph classification, but they often struggle to generalize, particularly to unseen or out-of-distribution (OOD) data. These challenges are exacerbated when training data is limited in size or diversity. To address these issues, we introduce a theoretical framework using Rademacher complexity to compute a regret bound on the generalization error and then characterize the effect of data augmentation. This framework informs the design of GRATIN, an efficient graph data augmentation algorithm leveraging the capability of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate any distribution. Our approach not only outperforms existing augmentation techniques in terms of generalization but also offers improved time complexity, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Prompt Tuning Transformers: Universality, Capacity and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the statistical and computational limits of prompt tuning for transformer-based foundation models. Our key contributions are prompt tuning on \emph{single-head} transformers with only a \emph{single} self-attention layer: (i) is universal, and (ii) supports efficient (even almost-linear time) algorithms under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Statistically, we prove that prompt tuning on such simplest possible transformers are universal approximators for sequence-to-sequence Lipschitz functions. In addition, we provide an exponential-in-$dL$ and -in-$(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound on the required soft-prompt tokens for prompt tuning to memorize any dataset with 1-layer, 1-head transformers. Computationally, we identify a phase transition in the efficiency of prompt tuning, determined by the norm of the \emph{soft-prompt-induced} keys and queries, and provide an upper bound criterion. Beyond this criterion, no sub-quadratic (efficient) algorithm for prompt tuning exists under SETH. Within this criterion, we showcase our theory by proving the existence of almost-linear time prompt tuning inference algorithms. These fundamental limits provide important necessary conditions for designing expressive and efficient prompt tuning methods for practitioners.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance (FRD): A Versatile Metric for Comparing Medical Imaging Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two sets of images belong to the same or different distributions or domains is a crucial task in modern medical image analysis and deep learning; for example, to evaluate the output quality of image generative models. Currently, metrics used for this task either rely on the (potentially biased) choice of some downstream task, such as segmentation, or adopt task-independent perceptual metrics (e.g., Fr\'echet Inception Distance/FID) from natural imaging, which we show insufficiently capture anatomical features. To this end, we introduce a new perceptual metric tailored for medical images, FRD (Fr\'echet Radiomic Distance), which utilizes standardized, clinically meaningful, and interpretable image features. We show that FRD is superior to other image distribution metrics for a range of medical imaging applications, including out-of-domain (OOD) detection, the evaluation of image-to-image translation (by correlating more with downstream task performance as well as anatomical consistency and realism), and the evaluation of unconditional image generation. Moreover, FRD offers additional benefits such as stability and computational efficiency at low sample sizes, sensitivity to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, feature interpretability, and correlation with radiologist-perceived image quality. Additionally, we address key gaps in the literature by presenting an extensive framework for the multifaceted evaluation of image similarity metrics in medical imaging -- including the first large-scale comparative study of generative models for medical image translation -- and release an accessible codebase to facilitate future research. Our results are supported by thorough experiments spanning a variety of datasets, modalities, and downstream tasks, highlighting the broad potential of FRD for medical image analysis.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Optimization Perspective of the Gauss-Newton Method for Feedforward Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14031v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of Gauss-Newton dynamics for training neural networks with smooth activation functions. In the underparameterized regime, the Gauss-Newton gradient flow induces a Riemannian gradient flow on a low-dimensional, smooth, embedded submanifold of the Euclidean output space. Using tools from Riemannian optimization, we prove \emph{last-iterate} convergence of the Riemannian gradient flow to the optimal in-class predictor at an \emph{exponential rate} that is independent of the conditioning of the Gram matrix, \emph{without} requiring explicit regularization. We further characterize the critical impacts of the neural network scaling factor and the initialization on the convergence behavior. In the overparameterized regime, we show that the Levenberg-Marquardt dynamics with an appropriately chosen damping schedule yields fast convergence rate despite potentially ill-conditioned neural tangent kernel matrices, analogous to the underparameterized regime. These findings demonstrate the potential of Gauss-Newton methods for efficiently optimizing neural networks in the near-initialization regime, particularly in ill-conditioned problems where kernel and Gram matrices have small singular values.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Justification for Asymmetric Actor-Critic Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.19116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning for partially observable environments, many successful algorithms have been developed within the asymmetric learning paradigm. This paradigm leverages additional state information available at training time for faster learning. Although the proposed learning objectives are usually theoretically sound, these methods still lack a precise theoretical justification for their potential benefits. We propose such a justification for asymmetric actor-critic algorithms with linear function approximators by adapting a finite-time convergence analysis to this setting. The resulting finite-time bound reveals that the asymmetric critic eliminates error terms arising from aliasing in the agent state.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Learning Sparse Superposed Features with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features within a representation space. In this work, we investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), in the form of relative \textit{triplet comparisons}. These features may represent various constructs, including dictionaries in LLMs or a covariance matrix of Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent's feedback is limited to distributional information. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two distinct applications: feature recovery from Recursive Feature Machines and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained on Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>BARK: A Fully Bayesian Tree Kernel for Black-box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform Bayesian optimization using a Gaussian process perspective on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). Our BART Kernel (BARK) uses tree agreement to define a posterior over piecewise-constant functions, and we explore the space of tree kernels using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. Where BART only samples functions, the resulting BARK model obtains samples of Gaussian processes defining distributions over functions, which allow us to build acquisition functions for Bayesian optimization. Our tree-based approach enables global optimization over the surrogate, even for mixed-feature spaces. Moreover, where many previous tree-based kernels provide uncertainty quantification over function values, our sampling scheme captures uncertainty over the tree structure itself. Our experiments show the strong performance of BARK on both synthetic and applied benchmarks, due to the combination of our fully Bayesian surrogate and the optimization procedure.</description>

      <title>Is Your Imitation Learning Policy Better than Mine? Policy Comparison with Near-Optimal Stopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10966v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks in challenging dexterous manipulation settings. As new methods are developed, they must be rigorously evaluated and compared against corresponding baselines through repeated evaluation trials. However, policy comparison is fundamentally constrained by a small feasible sample size (e.g., 10 or 50) due to significant human effort and limited inference throughput of policies. This paper proposes a novel statistical framework for rigorously comparing two policies in the small sample size regime. Prior work in statistical policy comparison relies on batch testing, which requires a fixed, pre-determined number of trials and lacks flexibility in adapting the sample size to the observed evaluation data. Furthermore, extending the test with additional trials risks inducing inadvertent p-hacking, undermining statistical assurances. In contrast, our proposed statistical test is sequential, allowing researchers to decide whether or not to run more trials based on intermediate results. This adaptively tailors the number of trials to the difficulty of the underlying comparison, saving significant time and effort without sacrificing probabilistic correctness. Extensive numerical simulation and real-world robot manipulation experiments show that our test achieves near-optimal stopping, letting researchers stop evaluation and make a decision in a near-minimal number of trials. Specifically, it reduces the number of evaluation trials by up to 32% as compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving the probabilistic correctness and statistical power of the comparison. Moreover, our method is strongest in the most challenging comparison instances (requiring the most evaluation trials); in a multi-task comparison scenario, we save the evaluator more than 160 simulation rollouts.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Fast Operator Splitting Methods for Stochastic Generalized Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop two classes of variance-reduced fast operator splitting methods to approximate solutions of both finite-sum and stochastic generalized equations. Our approach integrates recent advances in accelerated fixed-point methods, co-hypomonotonicity, and variance reduction. First, we introduce a class of variance-reduced estimators and establish their variance-reduction bounds. This class covers both unbiased and biased instances and comprises common estimators as special cases, including SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD. Next, we design a novel accelerated variance-reduced forward-backward splitting (FBS) algorithm using these estimators to solve finite-sum and stochastic generalized equations. Our method achieves both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ convergence rates on the expected squared norm $\mathbb{E}[ \| G_{\lambda}x^k\|^2]$ of the FBS residual $G_{\lambda}$, where $k$ is the iteration counter. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, almost sure convergence rates and almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution in stochastic accelerated methods. Unlike existing stochastic fixed-point algorithms, our methods accommodate co-hypomonotone operators, which potentially include nonmonotone problems arising from recent applications. We further specify our method to derive an appropriate variant for each stochastic estimator -- SVRG, SAGA, SARAH, and Hybrid-SGD -- demonstrating that they achieve the best-known complexity for each without relying on enhancement techniques. Alternatively, we propose an accelerated variance-reduced backward-forward splitting (BFS) method, which attains similar convergence rates and oracle complexity as our FBS method. Finally, we validate our results through several numerical experiments and compare their performance.</description>
