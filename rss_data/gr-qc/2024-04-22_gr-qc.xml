      <title>Imprints of Changing Mass and Spin on Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the imprints of gravitational radiation-reaction driven changes to a black hole's mass and spin on the corresponding ringdown waveform. We do so by comparing the dynamics of a perturbed black hole evolved with the full (nonlinear) versus linearized Einstein equations. As expected, we find that the quasinormal mode amplitudes extracted from nonlinear evolution deviate from their linear counterparts at third order in initial perturbation amplitude. For perturbations leading to a change in the black hole mass and spin of $\sim 5\%$, which is reasonable for a remnant formed in an astrophysical merger, we find that nonlinear distortions to the complex amplitudes of some quasinormal modes can be as large as $\sim 50\%$ at the peak of the waveform. Furthermore, the change in the mass and spin results in a drift in the quasinormal mode frequencies, which for large amplitude perturbations causes the nonlinear waveform to rapidly dephase with respect to its linear counterpart. %These two nonlinear effects together create a large distortion in both the amplitude and phase of the ringdown gravitational waveform. Surprisingly, despite these nonlinear effects creating significant deviations in the nonlinear waveform, we show that a linear quasinormal mode model still performs quite well from close to the peak amplitude onwards.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extra dimensions theories from gravitational quantum barrier experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum-bouncer experiment involving ultracold neutrons in a braneworld scenario. Extra-dimensional theories typically predict the strengthening of gravitational interactions over short distances. In this paper, we specifically study the anomalous gravitational interaction between the bouncing neutron and the reflecting mirror, resulting from hidden dimensions, and its effect on the outcome of this experiment in the context of a thickbrane model. This analysis allows us to identify which physical quantity of this extra-dimensional theory this neutron experiment is capable of constraining. Based on the experimental data, we found a new and independent empirical bound on free parameters of the model: the higher-dimensional gravitational constant and a parameter related to a transverse width of the confined matter inside the thickbrane. This new bound is valid in scenarios with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions greater than two. In this manner, by considering the thickness of the brane, we have been able to extend previous studies on this topic, which were limited to models with few codimensions, due to non-computability problems of power-law corrections of the gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>Cosmology from String T-duality and zero-point length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by String T-duality and taking into account the zero-point length correction, $l_0$, to the gravitational potential, we construct modified Friedmann equations by applying the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe. The cosmological viability of this extended scenario is investigated by studying influences on the evolution of the early Universe and performing the cosmographic analysis. Furthermore, we explore the inflationary paradigm under the slow-roll condition. By testing the model against observational data, the zero-point length is constrained around the Planck scale, in compliance with the original assumption from String T-duality. We also study the growth of density perturbations in the linear regime. It is shown that the zero-point length stands out as an alternative characterization for the broken-power-law spectrum, which provides a better fitting for the experimental measurements comparing to the simple power-law potential. Finally, we focus on implications for the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) spectrum. Should the zero-point length be running over energy scales, as is the case for all parameters and coupling constants in quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, deviations from General Relativity (GR) might be potentially tested through upcoming PGW observatories.</description>

      <title>Black Hole shadows of $\alpha'$-corrected black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the qualitative features induces by corrections to GR coming from String Theory, on the shadows of rotating black holes. We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $\alpha'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the ISCO and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $\alpha'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave probes of Barrow cosmology with LISA standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Barrow cosmological model, which proposes that quantum gravity effects create a complex, fractal structure for the universe's apparent horizon. We leverage the thermodynamics - gravity conjecture. By applying the Clausius relation to the apparent horizon of the Friedmann - Lema\^itre - Robertson - Walker universe within this framework, we derive modified field equations where the Barrow entropy is linked to the horizon. We assess the Barrow cosmology against current observations - cosmic microwave background , supernovae , and baryon acoustic oscillations data - and include projections for future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) standard sirens (SS). Our numerical results suggest a modest improvement in the Hubble tension for Barrow cosmology with phantom dark energy behavior, compared to the standard cosmological model. Furthermore, incorporating simulated LISA SS data alongside existing observational constraints tightens the limitations on cosmological parameters, particularly the deformation exponent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spacetimes from General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a non-commutative product for curved spacetimes, that can be regarded as a generalization of the Rieffel (or Moyal-Weyl) product. This product employs the exponential map and a Poisson tensor, and the deformed product maintains associativity under the condition that the Poisson tensor $\Theta$ satisfies $\Theta^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\nu}\Theta^{\rho\sigma}=0$, in relation to a Levi-Cevita connection. We proceed to solve the associativity condition for various physical spacetimes, uncovering non-commutative structures with compelling properties.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the model put forth by Ref. \cite{Oppenheim:2024rcp}, in which it is claimed that "post-quantum classical gravity" (PQCG), a stochastic theory of gravity, leads to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) behavior on galactic scales that reproduces galactic rotation curves. We show that this analysis has two basic problems: (i) the equations of PQCG do not lead to a new large scale force of the form claimed in the paper, and (ii) the form claimed is not of the MONDian form anyhow and so does not correspond to observed galactic dynamics. We also mention other potential problems that might arise from stochastic gravitational behavior.</description>

      <title>Reconciling $S_8$: Insights from Interacting Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We do a careful investigation of the prospects of dark energy (DE) interacting with cold dark matter (CDM) in alleviating the $S_8$ clustering tension. To this end, we consider various well-known parametrizations of the DE equation of state (EoS), and consider perturbations in both the dark sectors, along with an interaction term. Moreover, we perform a separate study for the phantom and non-phantom regimes. Using CMB, BAO and SNIa datasets, the constraints on the model parameters for each case have been obtained and a generic reduction in the $H_0-\sigma_{8,0}$ correlation has been observed, both for constant and dynamical DE EoS. This reduction, coupled with a significant negative correlation between the interaction term and $\sigma_{8,0}$, contributes to easing the clustering tension by lowering $\sigma_{8,0}$ to somewhere in between the early CMB and late-time clustering measurements for the phantom regime, for almost all the models under consideration. In addition, this is achieved without exacerbating the Hubble tension. In this regard, the CPL and JBP models perform the best in relaxing the $S_8$ tension to $&lt;1\sigma$. However, for the non-phantom regime the $\sigma_{8,0}$ tension tends to have worsened, which reassures the merits of phantom dark energy from latest data. We further do an investigation of the role of RSD datasets and find an overall reduction in tension, with a value of $\sigma_{8,0}$ relatively closer to the CMB value. We finally check if further extensions of this scenario, like the inclusion of the sound speed of dark energy and warm dark matter interacting with DE, can have some effects.</description>

      <title>Unequal-mass, highly-spinning binary black hole mergers in the stable mass transfer formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing database of gravitational-wave (GW) detections with the binary black holes (BHs) merging in the distant Universe contains subtle insights into their formation scenarios. One of the puzzling properties of detected GW sources is the possible (anti)correlation between mass ratio q of BH-BH binaries and their effective spin. We use rapid binary evolution models to demonstrate that the isolated binary evolution followed by efficient tidal spin-up of stripped helium core produces a similar pattern in Xeff vs q distributions of BH-BH mergers. In our models, the progenitors of unequal BH-BH systems in the stable mass transfer formation scenario are more likely to efficiently shrink their orbits during the second Roche-lobe overflow than the binaries that evolve into nearly equal-mass component systems. This makes it easier for unequal-mass progenitors to enter the tidal spin-up regime and later merge due to GW emission. Our results are, however, sensitive to some input assumptions, especially, the stability of mass transfer and the angular momentum loss during non-conservative mass transfer. We note that mass transfer prescriptions widely adopted in rapid codes favor the formation of BH-BH merger progenitors with unequal masses and moderate separations. We compare our results with detailed stellar model grids and find reasonable agreement after appropriate calibration of the physics models. We anticipate that future detections of unequal-mass BH-BH mergers could provide valuable constraints on the role of the stable mass transfer formation channel. A significant fraction of BH-BH detections with mass ratio q in range (0.4 - 0.7) would be consistent with the mass ratio reversal scenario during the first, relatively conservative mass transfer, and a non-enhanced angular momentum loss during the second, highly non-conservative mass transfer phase.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational-wave bursts from black hole binaries in the Galactic Center with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black hole binaries (BHBs) in galactic nuclei are gravitationally perturbed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the host galaxy, potentially inducing strong eccentricity oscillations through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. These highly eccentric binaries emit a train of gravitational-wave (GW) bursts detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) -- a planned space-based GW detector -- with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) up to ${\sim}100$ per burst. In this work, we study the GW signature of BHBs orbiting our galaxy's SMBH, Sgr A$^*$, which are consequently driven to very high eccentricities. We demonstrate that an unmodeled approach using a wavelet decomposition of the data effectively yields the time-frequency properties of each burst, provided that the GW frequency peaks between $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$--$10^{-1}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The wavelet parameters may be used to infer the eccentricity of the binary, measuring $\log_{10}(1-e)$ within an error of $20\%$. Our proposed search method can thus constrain the parameter space to be sampled by complementary Bayesian inference methods, which use waveform templates or orthogonal wavelets to reconstruct and subtract the signal from LISA data.</description>

      <title>Climbing over the potential barrier during inflation via null energy condition violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) may play a crucial role in enabling a scalar field to climb over high potential barriers, potentially significant in the very early universe. We propose a single-field model where the universe sequentially undergoes a first stage of slow-roll inflation, NEC violation, and a second stage of slow-roll inflation. Through the NEC violation, the scalar field climbs over high potential barriers, leaving unique characteristics on the primordial gravitational wave power spectrum, including a blue-tilted nature in the middle-frequency range and diminishing oscillation amplitudes at higher frequencies. Additionally, the power spectrum exhibits nearly scale-invariant behavior on both large and small scales.</description>

Abstract: Embedded walls are domain wall solutions which are unstable in the vacuum but stabilized in a plasma of the early Universe. We show how embedded walls in which the electroweak symmetry is restored can lead to an efficient scenario of electroweak baryogenesis. We construct an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics in which embedded walls exist and are stabilized in an electromagnetic plasma.</description>

      <title>Kerr Black Hole in Einstein--\AE{}ther Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While non-rotating black-hole solutions are well known in Einstein--\ae{}ther gravity, no axisymmetric solutions endowed with Killing horizons have been so far found outside of the slowly rotating limit. Here we show that the Kerr spacetime is also an exact vacuum solution of Einstein--\ae{}ther gravity in a phenomenologically viable corner of the parameter space; the corresponding \ae{}ther flow is characterised by a vanishing expansion. Such solution displays all the characteristic features of the Kerr metric (inner and outer horizons, ergoregion, etc.) with the remarkable exception of the causality-violating region in proximity of the ring singularity. However, due to the associated \ae{}ther flow, it is endowed with a special surface, inside the Killing horizon, which exhibits many features normally related to the universal horizon of the non-rotating solutions -- to which it tends in the limit of zero angular momentum. Hence, these Kerr black holes are very good mimickers of their general relativity counterparts while sporting important differences and specific structures. As such, they appear particularly well-suited candidates for future phenomenological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of asymptotically flat spacetime in even dimensions $d\geq 4$. We analyze the most general boundary condition and asymptotic symmetry compatible with Penrose's definition of asymptotic null infinity $\mathscr{I}$ through conformal compactification. Following Penrose's prescription and using a minimal version of the Bondi-Sachs gauge, we show that $\mathscr{I}$ is naturally equipped with a Carrollian stress tensor whose radial derivative defines the asymptotic Weyl tensor. This analysis describes asymptotic infinity as a stretched horizon in the conformally compactified spacetime. We establish that charge aspects conservation can be written as Carrollian Bianchi identities for the asymptotic Weyl tensor. We then provide a covariant renormalization for the asymptotic symplectic potential, which results in a finite symplectic flux and asymptotic charges. The renormalization scheme works even in the presence of logarithmic anomalies.</description>

      <title>Classical Kerr-Schild double copy in bigravity for maximally symmetric spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalized Kerr-Schild ansatz for bigravity, already considered in the literature, which leads to linear interactions between the metrics is used to study the bigravity equations in the context of the double copy. By contracting the resulting spin-2 field bigravity equations of motion using Killing vector fields, as is usually carried out in general relativity, we arrive to the single and zeroth copy equations for the mentioned ansatz. For the case of stationary solutions, we obtain two Maxwell and two conformally coupled scalar field equations for the single and zeroth copies respectively, and the linear interactions are absent. In the time-dependent case we obtain equations for the fields which are coupled. By decoupling these equations and at the zeroth copy level, we recover a massless and a massive field whose mass is proportional to the Fierz-Pauli mass and depends on the coefficients of the interaction potential between the metrics. This has been also previously documented in the literature and is now reinterpreted within the context of the double copy proposal.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Conformal Killing cosmology with Sinyukov tensors: geometry and growth of structures</title>

Abstract: We introduce perfect fluid Sinyukov-like tensors, a special kind of conformal Killing tensors, and prove a characterization of generalized RW spacetimes. In cosmological (RW) framework, we study the Friedmann equations of Conformal Killing Gravity. In addition to ordinary matter they contain a dark fluid and a Lambda term emergent from the conformal Killing extension. We then solve the equation for the evolution, in linear approximation, of the density contrast in matter-dominated universe. The main result is that the presence of the dark sector and the Lambda term gives no significative deviation from Lambda-CDM and ordinary GR results for the overdensity growth.</description>

      <title>What is a reference frame in General Relativity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In General Relativity, reference frames must be distinguished from coordinates. The former represent physical systems interacting with the gravitational system, aside from possible approximations, while the latter are mathematical artefacts. We propose a novel three-fold distinction between Idealised Reference Frames, Dynamical Reference Frames and Real Reference Frames. In doing so, the paper not only clarifies the physical significance of reference frames, but also sheds light on the similarities between idealised reference frames and coordinates. It also analyses the salience of reference frames to define local Dirac observables and to propose a physical interpretation to diffeomorphism gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory for Extreme Mass Ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an effective field theory describing a pair of gravitationally interacting point particles in an expansion in their mass ratio, also known as the self-force (SF) expansion. The 0SF dynamics are trivially obtained to all orders in Newton's constant by the geodesic motion of the light body in a Schwarzschild background encoding the gravitational field of the heavy body. The corrections at 1SF and higher are generated by perturbations about this configuration -- that is, the geodesic deviation of the light body and the fluctuation graviton -- but crucially supplemented by an operator describing the recoil of the heavy body as it interacts with the smaller companion. Using this formalism we compute new results at third post-Minkowskian order for the conservative dynamics of a system of gravitationally interacting massive particles coupled to a set of additional scalar and vector fields.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic Effects on the Squeezing of Axion Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is assumed in standard cosmology that the Universe underwent a period of inflation in its earliest phase, providing the seeds for structure formation through vacuum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field. These fluctuations get stretched by the quasi-exponential expansion of the Universe and become squeezed. The aim of this paper is to deepen the understanding of the squeezing process, considering the effect of self-interactions. Axion-like particles can provide a useful setup to study this effect. Specifically we focus on the consequences that a non-trivial evolution of the background axion field has on the squeezing of the perturbations. We follow the evolution of the axion's fluctuation modes from the horizon exit during inflation to the radiation-dominated epoch. We compute Bogoliubov coefficients and squeezing parameters, which are linked to the axion particle number and isocurvature perturbation. We find that the quantum mechanical particle production and the squeezing of the perturbations are enhanced, if one accounts for anharmonic effects, i.e., the effect of higher order terms in the potential. This effect becomes particularly strong towards the hilltop of the potential.</description>

      <title>A comparison between axion-like and power law potentials in cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compare the scalar field dynamics in axion-like and power law potentials for both positive and negative values of the exponents. We find that, for positive exponents, both the potentials exhibit similar scalar field dynamics and it can be difficult to distinguish them at least at the background level. Even though the potentials are oscillatory in nature for positive exponents scaling solutions can be achieved for larger values of the exponent for which the dynamics can be different during early times. Because of the presence of this scaling nature there is a turnaround in the values of the scalar field equation of state as we increase the values of the exponent in both the potentials. This indicates the deviation from the oscillatory behaviour for the larger values of the exponent. For negative values of the exponent, the dynamics of the scalar field is distinguishable and axion-like potential can give rise to cosmologically viable tracker solutions unlike the power law potentials. For negative values of the exponent, axion-like potential can behave like a cosmological constant around its minima and the dark energy scale can be related to the potential scale. Due to the cosmological constant like behavior of the axion-like potential for negative exponent around its minima the late time dynamics can be similar to $\Lambda$CDM and we get similar observational constraint on the parameters for both $\Lambda$CDM and axion-like potential with negative exponent. So, while for positive exponents we may not distinguish the two potentials for negative exponents the dynamics of the scalar field is distinguishable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we study classical aspects of superconformal field theory via symmetry principles. Specifically, by employing the powerful setup of conformal superspace, we obtain a plethora of new results in the fields of geometric and higher symmetries, (super)conformal higher-spin theory and conformal supergravity. These findings open up numerous novel research pathways.</description>

      <title>Dark Dimension and the Effective Field Theory limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>
