      <title>Study of the electromagnetic form factors of the nucleons in the timelike region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic form factors $G_{\rm E}$ and $G_{\rm M}$ of the proton and neutron in the timelike region are extracted in a study of the processes $e^+ e^-\to \bar{p}p$ and $e^+ e^-\to \bar{n}n$. The reaction amplitude is evaluated within the distorted wave Born approximation, with the interaction of the antinucleon-nucleon ($\bar{N}N$) pair taken into account. The latter is constructed within $SU(3)$ chiral effective field theory up to the next-to-leading order. An excellent description of the $e^+ e^-\to \bar{N}N$ data in the energy region from the $\bar{N}N$ threshold up to center-of-mass energies $E_{\rm cm}=2.2$~GeV is achieved. Results for the electromagnetic form factors $G_{\rm E}, G_{\rm M}$, $G_{\rm E}/G_{\rm M}$, and the subtracted effective form factors, $G_{\rm osc}$, are provided. These can be helpful for further studies of the properties of the nucleons.</description>

      <title>Nuclear charge radius predictions by kernel ridge regression with odd-even effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extended kernel ridge regression (EKRR) method with odd-even effects was adopted to improve the description of the nuclear charge radius using five commonly used nuclear models. These are: (i) the isospin dependent $A^{1/3}$ formula, (ii) relativistic continuum Hartree-Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory, (iii) Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) model HFB25, (iv) the Weizs\"acker-Skyrme (WS) model WS$^\ast$, and (v) HFB25$^\ast$ model. In the last two models, the charge radii were calculated using a five-parameter formula with the nuclear shell corrections and deformations obtained from the WS and HFB25 models, respectively. For each model, the resultant root-mean-square deviation for the 1014 nuclei with proton number $Z \geq 8$ can be significantly reduced to 0.009-0.013~fm after considering the modification with the EKRR method. The best among them was the RCHB model, with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.0092~fm. The extrapolation abilities of the KRR and EKRR methods for the neutron-rich region were examined and it was found that after considering the odd-even effects, the extrapolation power was improved compared with that of the original KRR method. The strong odd-even staggering of nuclear charge radii of Ca and Cu isotopes and the abrupt kinks across the neutron $N=126$ and 82 shell closures were also calculated and could be reproduced quite well by calculations using the EKRR method.</description>

      <title>Nucleon microscopy in proton-nucleus scattering via analysis of bremsstrahlung emission: role of incoherent emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic form factors of protons in proton-nucleus scattering via analysing of experimental cross-sections of accompanying bremsstrahlung photons. A new bremsstrahlung model for proton-nucleus scattering is developed, where a main focus is given on incoherent bremsstrahlung that has not been considered previously. In analysis we choose experimental bremsstrahlung data of $p$ + $^{197}$Au scattering at proton beam energy of 190 MeV obtained by TAPS collaboration. We find the following. (1) Inclusion of incoherent emission to calculations improves agreements with experimental data essentially, contribution of incoherent bremsstrahlung is essentially larger than coherent one. (2) Inclusion of form factors of the scattered proton improves agreement with experimental data in comparison with calculations with coherent and incoherent contributions without form factors. (3) Sensitivity of model in study of form factors of the scattered proton is high. This demonstrates a new opportunity to study internal structure of protons under influence of nuclear forces in nuclear scattering.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclear constraints on the existence and lifetime of a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study to what extent the unique observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei by their weak decay into known $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, with lifetimes of order 10$^{-10}$ s, rules out the existence of a deeply bound doubly-strange (${\cal S}$=$-$2) $H$ dibaryon. Treating ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}$ (the Nagara emulsion event) in a realistic $\Lambda-\Lambda-{^4}$He three-body model, we find that the ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}\to H + {^4{\rm He}}$ strong-interaction lifetime increases beyond 10$^{-10}$ s for $m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$, about 176 MeV below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, so that such a deeply bound $H$ is not in conflict with hypernuclear data. Constrained by $\Lambda$ hypernuclear $\Delta{\cal S}$=1 nonmesonic weak-interaction decay rates, we evaluate the $\Delta{\cal S}$=2 $H\to nn$ weak-decay lifetime of $H$ in the mass range $2m_n \lesssim m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$. The resulting $H$ lifetime is of order 10$^4$ s, many orders of magnitude shorter than required to qualify for a dark-matter candidate. A lower-mass absolutely stable $H$, $m_H\lesssim 2m_n$, is likely to be ruled out by established limits of nuclear stability such as for $^{16}$O.</description>

      <title>Strange quark matter as dark matter: 40 years later, a reappraisal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forty years ago, Witten suggested that dark matter could be composed of macroscopic clusters of strange quark matter. This idea was very popular for several years, but it dropped out of fashion once lattice QCD calculations indicated that the confinement/deconfinement transition, at small baryonic chemical potential, is not first order, which seemed to be a crucial requirement in order to produce large clusters of quarks. Here we revisit both the conditions under which strangelets can be produced in the Early Universe and the many phenomenological implications of their existence. Most of the paper discusses the limits on their mass distribution and a possible and simple scheme for their production. Finally, we discuss the most promising techniques to detect this type of objects.</description>

      <title>Analysis of QCD at finite isospin density: on the relationship between quark degrees of freedom in hadrons and equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quark contribution to the equation of state (EOS) of the isospin QCD matter using the two-flavor quark meson model at finite isospin density. This model includes the quark degrees of freedom through the lowest order of the loop correction. This model describes the crossover of the pion condensate from the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase at low density to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase at high density. In the absence of the quark degrees of freedom the pion condensate behaves as the bosonic object, but the quark substructure becomes important and suppress the pion condensate by Pauli blocking as density increase.
  As the isospin density increases, the EOS rapidly becomes stiff and approaches to the quark matter even before pion starts to overlap. Consequently, the sound velocity exceeds the conformal value $c_s^2 = 1/3$, forming a peak structure and then relax to the conformal value from above at high density. This is in good agreement with the recent lattice QCD (LQCD) result. In contrast, the perturbative QCD (pQCD) result suggests that the sound velocity approaches to the conformal value from below. This discrepancy comes from the non-perturbative effects arising from the pion condensate or the quark-antiquark correlation near the Fermi surface in the quark meson model. We also investigated the trace anomaly as another measure of conformality.
  The effects of finite temperature on sound velocity were also examined. On the isentropic trajectory, where $s/n_I$ is fixed, the thermal quarks were found to suppress the sound velocity and smear out the peak structure. The thermal mesons are considered to be important at zero density from LQCD, which is confirmed in this model calculation. The analysis is further extended to the condensed phase at high density, where it is found that thermal mesons do not significantly contribute to the EOS.</description>

      <title>Exact unified tetraquark equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently we formulated covariant equations describing the tetraquark in terms of an admixture of two-body states $D\bar D$ (diquark-antidiquark), $MM$ (meson-meson), and three-body-like states where two of the quarks are spectators while the other two are interacting [Phys. Rev. D 107, 094014 (2023)]. A feature of these equations is that they unify descriptions of seemingly unrelated models of the tetraquark, like, for example, the $D\bar D$ model of the Moscow group [Faustov et al., Universe 7, 94 (2021)] and the coupled channel $D \bar D-MM$ model of the Giessen group [Heupel et al., Phys. Lett. B718, 545 (2012)]. Here we extend these equations to the exact case where $q\bar{q}$ annihilation is incorporated explicitly, and all previously neglected terms (three-body forces, non-pole contributions to two-quark t matrices, etc.) are taken into account through the inclusion of a single $q\bar{q}$ potential $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on extra dimensions theories from gravitational quantum barrier experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the quantum-bouncer experiment involving ultracold neutrons in a braneworld scenario. Extra-dimensional theories typically predict the strengthening of gravitational interactions over short distances. In this paper, we specifically study the anomalous gravitational interaction between the bouncing neutron and the reflecting mirror, resulting from hidden dimensions, and its effect on the outcome of this experiment in the context of a thickbrane model. This analysis allows us to identify which physical quantity of this extra-dimensional theory this neutron experiment is capable of constraining. Based on the experimental data, we found a new and independent empirical bound on free parameters of the model: the higher-dimensional gravitational constant and a parameter related to a transverse width of the confined matter inside the thickbrane. This new bound is valid in scenarios with an arbitrary number of extra dimensions greater than two. In this manner, by considering the thickness of the brane, we have been able to extend previous studies on this topic, which were limited to models with few codimensions, due to non-computability problems of power-law corrections of the gravitational potential.</description>

      <title>Study of bottom quark dynamics via non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bottom quark energy loss via the nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. The space-time profile of quark-gluon plasma is obtained from the CLVisc hydrodynamics simulation, the dynamical evolution of heavy quarks inside the color deconfined QCD medium is simulated using a linear Boltzmann transport model that combines Yukawa and string potentials of heavy-quark-medium interactions, the hadronization of heavy quarks is performed using a hybrid coalescence-fragmentation model, and the decay of $B$ mesons is simulated via PYTHIA. Using this numerical framework, we calculate the transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) dependent $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of direct $D$ mesons, $B$ mesons, and non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ from $B$ meson decay in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=5.02$ TeV. We find the mass hierarchy of the nuclear modification of prompt $D$ and $B$ mesons depends on their $p_\mathrm{T}$. Both $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and $v_2$ of heavy flavor particles show strong $p_\mathrm{T}$ and centrality dependences due to the interplay between parton energy loss, medium geometry and flow, and hadronization of heavy quarks. Non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ share similar patterns of $R_\mathrm{AA}$ and $v_2$ to $B$ mesons except for a $p_\mathrm{T}$ shift during the decay processes. Therefore, future more precise measurements on non-prompt $D^0$ and $J/\psi$ can help further pin down the bottom quark dynamics inside the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>The MONUMENT Experiment: Ordinary Muon Capture studies for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MONUMENT experiment measures ordinary muon capture (OMC) on isotopes relevant for neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay and nuclear astrophysics. OMC is a particularly attractive tool for improving the theoretical description of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay. It involves similar momentum transfers and allows testing the virtual transitions involved in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay against experimental data. During the 2021 campaign, MONUMENT measured OMC on $^{76}$Se and $^{136}$Ba, the isotopes relevant for next-generation 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay searches, like LEGEND and nEXO. The experimental setup has been designed to accurately extract the total and partial muon capture rates, which requires precise reconstruction of energies and time-dependent intensities of the OMC-related $\gamma$ rays. The setup also includes a veto counter system to allow selecting a clean sample of OMC events. This work provides a detailed description of the MONUMENT setup operated during the 2021 campaign, its two DAQ systems, calibration and analysis approaches, and summarises the achieved detector performance. Future improvements are also discussed.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of compact stars with dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of compact stars admixed with non-self annihilating self-interacting fermionic dark matter, delineating the dependence on the nuclear equation of state by considering the two limiting parametrized equations of state for neutron star matter obtained by smoothly matching the low-density chiral effective theory and the high-density perturbative QCD. These two parametrizations are the limiting cases of a wide variety of smooth equations of state, i.e. the softest and stiffest possible one without a phase transition, that generate masses and radii compatible with 2M$_\odot$ observations and the tidal constraint from GW170817. With an exhaustive analysis of the possible stable mass-radius configurations, we determine the quantity of dark matter contained in stars with masses and radii compatible with the aforementioned astrophysical constraints. We find that for dark particle masses of a few tenths of GeV, the dark core collapses and no stable solutions are found irrespective on the chosen nuclear equation of state. For lower masses, the dark matter fraction is limited to 10%, being at most 1% for masses ranging from 0.1 to 10 GeV for the limiting soft nuclear equation of state. For the limiting stiff nuclear equation of state, the dark matter fraction can reach values of more than 10%, but the dark particle mass is being constrained to 0.3 GeV and 10 GeV for the weak self-interacting case and has to be at least 5 GeV for the strong self-interacting one. For dark particle masses of less than 0.1 GeV, stable neutron star configurations should have less than 1% of self-interacting dark matter to be compatible with the constraint of the tidal deformability from GW170817 irrespective on the chosen nuclear equation of state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractor is a concept that describes universal equilibration behavior in which systems lose microscopic details before hydrodynamics becomes applicable. We propose a setup to observe hydrodynamic attractors in ultracold atomic gases, taking advantage of the fact that driving the two-body $s$-wave scattering length causes phenomena equivalent to isotropic fluid expansions. We specifically consider two-component fermions with contact interactions in three dimensions and discuss their dynamics under a power-law drive of the scattering length in a uniform system, employing a hydrodynamic relaxation model. We analytically solve their dynamics and find the hydrodynamic attractor solution. Our results establish the cold atom systems as a new platform for exploring hydrodynamic attractors.</description>

Abstract: Particle production yields measured in central Au-Au collision at RHIC are obtained with free Fermi and Bose gases and also with a replacement of these statistics by non-extensive statistics. For the latter calculation, a set of different parameters was used with values of the Tsallis parameter $q$ chosen between 1.01 and 1.25, with 1.16 generating the best agreement with experimental data, an indication that non-extensive statistics may be one of the underlying features in heavy ion-collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{229}$Th nucleus has a unique transition at only 8 eV which could be used for a novel nuclear clock. We investigate theoretically the prospects of driving this transition with vortex light beams carrying orbital angular momentum. Numerical results are presented for two experimental configurations which are promising for the design of the planned nuclear clock: a trapped ion setup and a large ensemble of nuclei doped into CaF$_2$ crystals which are transparent in the frequency range of the nuclear transition. We discuss the feasibility of the vortex beam nuclear excitation and compare the excitation features with the case of plane wave beams.</description>

      <title>Emerging {\gamma}-soft-like spectrum in 196Pt in the SU3-IBM (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been argued that a spherical-like spectrum emerges in the SU3-IBM, opening up new approaches to understand the {\gamma}-softness in realistic nuclei. In a previous paper, {\gamma}-softness with degeneracy of the ground and quasi-{\gamma} bands was observed. In this paper, another special point connected with the middle degenerate point is discussed, which is found to be related with the properties of 196Pt. This emergent {\gamma}-softness has also been shown to be important for understanding the prolate-oblate asymmetric shape phase transition. The low-lying spectra, B(E2) values and quadrupole moments in 196Pt are discussed showing that the new model can account for several observed features. This is the first part of the discussions on the {\gamma}-soft-like spectrum of 196Pt.</description>

The need for more measurements and systematic calculations is discussed to allow the differentiation of different models of the Bohr-Weisskopf effect in nuclei.</description>

      <title>In-medium loop corrections and longitudinally polarized gauge bosons in high-energy showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08796</link>
      <description>arXiv:1806.08796v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The splitting processes of bremsstrahlung and pair production in a medium are coherent over large distances in the very high energy limit, which leads to a suppression known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We continue study of the case when the coherence lengths of two consecutive splitting processes overlap (which is important for understanding corrections to standard treatments of the LPM effect in QCD), avoiding soft-emission approximations. In this particular paper, we show (i) how the "instantaneous" interactions of Light-Cone Perturbation Theory must be included in the calculation to account for effects of longitudinally-polarized gauge bosons in intermediate states, and (ii) how to compute virtual corrections to LPM emission rates, which will be necessary in order to make infrared-safe calculations of the characteristics of in-medium QCD showering of high-energy partons. In order to develop these topics in as simple a context as possible, we will focus in the current paper not on QCD but on large-$N_f$ QED, where $N_f$ is the number of electron flavors.</description>

      <title>NNNLO pressure of cold quark matter: leading logarithm</title>

Abstract: At high baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, the equation of state of QCD allows a weak-coupling expansion in the QCD coupling $\alpha_s$. The result is currently known up to and including the full next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) $\alpha_s^2$. Starting at this order, the computations are complicated by the modification of particle propagation in a dense medium, which necessitates non-perturbative treatment of the scale $\alpha_s^{1/2} \mu_B$. In this work, we apply a Hard-Thermal-Loop scheme for capturing the contributions of this scale to the weak-coupling expansion, and use it to determine the leading-logarithm contribution to NNNLO: $\alpha_s^3 \ln^2 \alpha_s$. This result is the first improvement to the equation of state of massless cold quark matter in 40 years. The new term is negligibly small, and thus significantly increases our confidence in the applicability of the weak-coupling expansion.</description>

      <title>Flavor hierarchy of parton energy loss in quark-gluon plasma from a Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quenching of light and heavy flavor hadrons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions probes the color and flavor dependences of parton energy loss through a color-deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and thus reveals the properties of QCD matter at extremely high density and temperature. By combining a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of parton production, a general ansatz of parton energy loss functions and parton fragmentation functions, we calculate the nuclear modification of various hadron species -- charged hadrons, $D$ mesons and $B$-decayed $J/\psi$ -- over a wide transverse momentum regime. Comparing our calculations to the experimental data using the Bayesian statistical analysis, we perform a first simultaneous extraction of the energy loss functions of gluons ($g$), light quarks ($q$), charm quarks ($c$) and bottom quarks ($b$) inside the QGP. We find that the average parton energy loss at high energies follows the expected hierarchy of $\langle \Delta E_g \rangle &gt; \langle \Delta E_q \rangle \sim \langle \Delta E_c \rangle &gt; \langle \Delta E_b \rangle$, while the parton energy loss distribution can further test the QCD calculations of parton interaction with the dense nuclear matter. We also find that the reduction of experimental uncertainties can significantly improve the precision of the extracted parton energy loss functions inside the QGP.</description>

      <title>Probing the four-fermion operators via the transverse double spin asymmetry at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chirality-flipping operators of light fermions are currently poorly constrained by experimental analyses due to the lack of interference with Standard Model (SM) amplitudes in traditional observables. In this work, we propose to investigate the semi-leptonic scalar/tensor four-fermion operators of electron and quarks through the transverse double spin asymmetry (DSA) at Electron-Ion Collider, where both the electron and proton beams could be highly transversely polarized. Due to the chirality-flipping nature of these operators, we demonstrate that their interference with the SM results in an unsuppressed contribution to the DSA, and could lead to non-trivial azimuthal $\cos2\phi$ and $\sin2\phi$ distributions that are linearly dependent on their Wilson coefficients. This new method has the potential to significantly improve the current constraints on these scalar/tensor four-fermion operators without relying on theoretical assumptions about other types of new physics effects, particularly for the tensor type operator of the $u$-quark. Additionally, our findings indicate that both the real and imaginary parts of these operators can be simultaneously constrained and offer a new opportunity for probing potential $CP$-violation effects. However, it is important to note that these results would be sensitive to the quark transversity distributions, which are currently poorly constrained by the experimental data, but could be significantly improved at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Therefore, our work opens up a new avenue to utilize this new spin asymmetry for exploring the new physics effects from the scalar/tensor four-fermion operators.</description>
