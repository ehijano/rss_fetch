      <title>Nonlocal nucleon-nucleus optical potentials from chiral effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlocality in microscopic optical potentials derived from chiral effective field theory. For this purpose we employ the Perey-Buck ansatz, which connects the energy dependence of purely local optical potentials to a Gaussian spatial nonlocality. We find that the dominant source of energy dependence in the microscopic real optical potential indeed arises from spatial nonlocalities, while the energy dependence associated with the microscopic imaginary optical potential is a genuine time nonlocality. We present results for nonlocal nucleon-nucleus optical potentials for the calcium isotopic chain and study the dependence of the Woods-Saxon shape parameters on the isotopic number.</description>

      <title>rho-Meson Nucleon Scattering Length from CLAS Threshold Photoproduction Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending our study of the vector meson-nucleon scattering lengths (summary is given in Ref.~\cite{Strakovsky:2021vyk}), we are focusing on the $\rho$-meson case using recent CLAS threshold data for the reaction $\gamma p \to \rho p$ within the meson-baryon reaction model~\cite{CLAS:2018drk}. The total $\sigma_t(\gamma p\to \rho p)$ and $\sigma_t(\gamma p\to \omega p)$ cross sections are close below the momentum of the vector meson in CM $q = 0.2~\mathrm{GeV/c}$. Then the $\rho p$ photoproduction cross section grows rapidly. Our result for $\rho N$ scattering length is a factor of 4 smaller than the size of the hadron and the phenomenological determination of the $\omega$ nucleon scattering length using threshold photoproduction cross sections. The observed difference between $\rho N$ and $\omega N$ scattering lengths is of interest for further understanding within the hadron structure theory.</description>

      <title>\textit{Ab initio} study in the island of inversion within the two-major-shell valence space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an \textit{ab initio} study of nuclear structure in the island of inversion around neutron number $N=20$, using multishell effective Hamiltonians derived from valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group approach combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method. By progressively expanding the valence space from the \textit{sd} shell to the intermediate $sdf_{7/2}p_{3/2}$ space and, for the first time, to the full \textit{sdfp} shell, we investigate low-lying spectra, $E2$ transition strengths, deformation properties, and neutron occupancies in even-even Ne, Mg, and Si isotopes around $N=20$. Our results show that enlarging the valence space significantly improves the description of quadrupole collectivity, yielding better agreement with experimental data for key observables such as the lowered $2^+$ energies and the enhanced $B(E2;0^+_1\rightarrow2_1^+)$ values. The analysis reveals the critical role of cross-shell multi-particle multi-hole excitations in breaking the $N=20$ shell closure and establishing intruder-dominated ground states. It also demonstrates the ability of the VS-IMSRG+PGCM framework to capture both dynamical (short range) and static (long range) correlations across multiple major-oscillator shells.</description>

      <title>New phases in QCD at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phases of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at finite temperature and baryon density is crucial for describing matter in heavy-ion collisions and the interior of neutron stars. While the transition from the confined phase to the deconfined phase has been extensively studied at vanishing chemical potential, recent theoretical work suggests the existence of intermediate phases with partial deconfinement, where only a subset of the color degrees of freedom is deconfined. In this paper, we study the generalization of partial deconfinement in QCD in the Veneziano large-$N_{\rm c}$ limit ($N_{\rm f}/N_{\rm c}$ fixed) to finite baryon chemical potential. We find that the partially deconfined phase has finer structure, and hence that there are four phases in QCD at finite temperature and moderately large chemical potential: complete confinement, complete deconfinement, and two kinds of partial deconfinement. A key ingredient is the refined understanding of the meaning of the 'Gross-Witten-Wadia point', i.e., the opening of a gap in the distribution of Polyakov line phases: either string condensation or baryon condensation causes the GWW transition. As a by-product, we observe the emergence of the QCD critical point from the interplay between baryon condensation and partial deconfinement. While our approach is necessarily qualitative due to the fermion sign problem, it provides a unified theoretical framework for understanding the rich phase structure of dense QCD matter and offers new perspectives on the location and nature of the QCD critical point.</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Limit Cycle: Universal Form for General Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Efimov effect, a remarkable realization of discrete scale invariance, emerges in the three-body problem with short-range interactions and is understood as a renormalization group (RG) limit cycle within Short-Range Effective Field Theory (SREFT). While the analytic form of the three-body renormalization relation has been established for a sharp cutoff regulator, its universality for other regulators remains underexplored. In this letter, we derive the universal functional form of the three-body renormalization relation for general separable regulators through a detailed analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian and Faddeev equations. We find that the relation is characterized by three parameters. This universality is verified numerically for various regulators. Although the functional form remains the same, the parameters characterizing the limit cycle exhibit regulator dependence. These findings broaden the class of RG limit cycles in SREFT and offer a more complete understanding of three-body renormalization.</description>

      <title>Parton physics from a heavy-quark operator product expansion: Lattice QCD calculation of the fourth moment of the pion distribution amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is an essential non-perturbative input for a range of high-energy exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics. Building on our previous work, the continuum limit of the fourth Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined in quenched QCD using quark masses which correspond to a pion mass of $m_\pi = 550$ MeV. This calculation finds $\langle\xi^2\rangle = 0.202(8)(9)$ and $\langle \xi^4 \rangle = 0.039(28)(11)$ where the first error indicates the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty from the analysis and the second indicates the uncertainty from working with Wilson coefficients computed to next-to-leading order. These results are presented in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme at a renormalization scale of $\mu = 2$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Influence of Dark Matter on Hybrid and Twin Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of dark matter (DM) on both hybrid and twin stars within a two-fluid framework, where DM and normal matter interact only through gravity. A self-interacting fermionic DM model is considered, while for nucleonic and quark matter we employ the relativistic mean-field model and the constant sound-speed parametrization, respectively. Our results show that DM significantly influences the formation of hybrid and twin stars, depending on the transition pressure and the discontinuity in energy density at a fixed sound speed. The presence of DM reduces the number of twin or hybrid stars compared to the case without DM, and this effect directly depends on the DM mass and fraction. We further find that the formation of DM-core or DM-halo configurations is mainly governed by DM parameters, whereas the realization of twin or hybrid star scenarios is primarily controlled by quark parameters. Using the $2M_\odot$ constraint, we demonstrate that the parameter space for twin stars can be further restricted in both DM-core and DM-halo scenarios.</description>

      <title>Dissipative contributions to spin polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the Zubarev non-equilibrium density operator method and a first-order gradient expansion, we provide a comprehensive classification of all possible spin polarization effects. A key finding is that, with the unique exception of those induced by the gradient of the spin potential, all first-order dissipative corrections are chiral, implying their dependence on parity-breaking interactions or chiral imbalance. The work also introduces new non-dissipative phenomena akin to the Spin Hall Effect, including the Chiral Spin Hall Effect, which offers a novel observable to probe QCD topological configurations.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the Dipole Amplitude in the Dipole Picture as a mathematical Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the inference problem of constraining the dipole amplitude with inclusive deep inelastic scattering data can be written into a discrete linear inverse problem, in an analogous manner as can be done for computed tomography. To this formulation of the problem, we apply standard inverse problems methods and algorithms to reconstruct known dipole amplitudes from simulated reduced cross section data with realistic precision. The main difference of this approach to previous works is that this implementation does not require any fit parametrization of the dipole amplitude. The freedom from parametrization also enables us for the first time to quantify the uncertainties of the inferred dipole amplitude in a novel more general framework. This mathematical approach to small-$x$ phenomenology opens a path to parametrization bias free inference of the dipole amplitude from HERA and Electron--Ion Collider data.</description>

      <title>Tensor-polarized twist-3 parton distribution functions $f_{LT}(x)$ for the spin-1 deuteron by using twist-2 relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor-polarized twist-3 parton distribution functions (PDFs) $f_{LT}(x)$ are calculated for the spin-1 deuteron by using twist-2 relations, which are similar to the Wandzura-Wilczek relation and the Burkhardt-Cottingham sum rule in the spin-1/2 nucleon, together with tensor-polarized twist-2 PDFs $f_{1LL}(x)$. The PDFs are shown for $f_{LT}(x)$ at $Q^2 =2.5$ GeV$^2$, where the tensor-polarized PDFs $f_{1LL}(x)$ are provided. The $x$-dependence of $f_{LT}(x)$ is similar to $f_{1LL}(x)$, and the magnitude of $f_{LT}(x)$ is roughly of the order of $f_{1LL}(x)$. In experiments at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), higher-twist effects could be sizable because $Q^2$ values are not very large in comparison with the hadronic scale of 1 GeV$^2$. Therefore, the JLab experiments could provide a good opportunity to investigate the twist-3 distributions $f_{LT}(x)$ in addition to the twist-2 ones $f_{1LL}(x)$. Furthermore, these tensor-polarized PDFs could be investigated at future Electron-Ion Colliders (EICs) and hadron accelerator facilities such as the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility (NICA), and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).</description>

      <title>Few is different: deciphering many-body dynamics in mesoscopic quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent macroscopic descriptions of matter, such as hydrodynamics, are central to our description of complex physical systems across a wide spectrum of energy scales. The conventional understanding of these many-body phenomena has recently been shaken by a number of experimental findings. Collective behavior of matter has been observed in \emph{mesoscopic} systems, such as high-energy hadron-hadron collisions, or ultra-cold gases with only few strongly interacting fermions. In such systems, the separation of scales between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics (at the heart of any effective theory) is inapplicable. To address the conceptual challenges that arise from these observations and explore the universality of emergent descriptions of matter, the EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force was assembled. This document summarizes the RRTF discussions on recent theoretical and experimental advances in this rapidly developing field. Leveraging technological breakthroughs in the control of quantum systems, we can now quantitatively explore what it means for a system to exhibit behavior beyond the sum of its individual parts. In particular, the report highlights how the (in)applicability of hydrodynamics and other effective theories can be probed across three principal frontiers: the size frontier, the equilibrium frontier, and the interaction frontier.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations of deeply virtual Compton scattering: investigating twist-4 kinematic power corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we include kinematic power corrections up to twist-four to the deeply virtual Compton scattering dispersion relation. We demonstrate that, both for (pseudo-)scalar and spin-$1/2$ targets, the formal expression of the $n$-subtracted leading-twist dispersion relations is preserved. However, the expression of the subtracted constants is modified by the kinematic powers. Importantly, the minimal-subtracted dispersion relation for the helicity-conserving amplitude, previously thought to depend only on the Polyakov-Weiss $D$-term, now also depends on the double distributions $F$ and $K$. Such a mixing may be critical for the Jefferson Lab kinematic range, as it is not suppressed for typical values of $t$ and $Q^{2}$ in the valence region. We therefore expect a strong impact on attempts to extract pressure forces from DVCS data.</description>

Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, shows they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present study, we investigate the possible existence of negative charged kaons and neutral anti-kaons in neutron stars by employing the relativistic mean field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K}^{0}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to simultaneously explain the current variety of astrophysical objects, it is essential to resurrect a scenario of two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

Abstract: We present a method to calculate neutron scattering cross sections for deformed nuclei using many--body wavefunctions described with multiple reference states. Nuclear states are calculated with the generator coordinate method using a low energy effective Hamiltonian. Using these states, a non--local and energy dependent optical potential is consistently constructed, allowing to directly investigate the role of nuclear structure properties in nuclear scattering.
  The case of neutron scattering on $^{24}$Mg is presented.
  The results are compared to experiment and to phenomenological optical potentials at energies below 13 MeV, demonstrating the importance of low--energy collectivity in elastic and non--elastic scattering.</description>

Abstract: The question of whether there are enough superfluid neutrons in the inner crust of neutron stars to explain pulsar glitches remains a topic of debate. Previous band structure calculations suggest that the entrainment effect significantly reduces the superfluid density. In this letter, a new derivation of the BCS expression for the superfluid density is given. We compute it in the superfluid band theory framework through linear response theory, for a small relative velocity between superfluid and normal components, under the assumption that the pairing gap in the rest frame of the superfluid is constant and not affected by the perturbation. Our result suggests that a formula extensively used in neutron star physics is incomplete. Numerical evaluations for two realistic configurations reveal that the previously neglected contribution drastically alters the picture of the superfluid reservoir in the inner crust of neutron stars, suggesting that about 90% of the neutrons are effectively superfluid.</description>
