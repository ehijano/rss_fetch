      <title>Digital Twin-Guided Energy Management over Real-Time Pub/Sub Protocol in 6G Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the emergence of 6G IoT networks has accelerated the deployment of enhanced smart city services, the resource limitations of IoT devices remain as a significant problem. Given this limitation, meeting the low-latency service requirement of 6G networks becomes even more challenging. However, existing 6G IoT management strategies lack real-time operation and mostly rely on discrete actions, which are insufficient to optimise energy consumption. To address these, in this study, we propose a Digital Twin (DT)-guided energy management framework to jointly handle the low latency and energy efficiency challenges in 6G IoT networks. In this framework, we provide the twin models through a distributed overlay network and handle the dynamic updates between the data layer and the upper layers of the DT over the Real-Time Publish Subscribe (RTPS) protocol. We also design a Reinforcement Learning (RL) engine with a novel formulated reward function to provide optimal data update times for each of the IoT devices. The RL engine receives a diverse set of environment states from the What-if engine and runs Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to output continuous actions to the IoT devices. Based on our simulation results, we observe that the proposed framework achieves a 37% improvement in 95th percentile latency and a 30% reduction in energy consumption compared to the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Trajectory Optimization and Power Control for Hierarchical UAV Swarms in 6G Aerial Access Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (BSs) to extend the ubiquitous connectivity for ground users (GUs) in the sixth-generation (6G) era. However, it is challenging to cooperatively deploy multiple UAV swarms in large-scale remote areas. Hence, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical UAV swarms structure for 6G aerial access networks, where the head UAVs serve as aerial BSs, and tail UAVs (T-UAVs) are responsible for relay. In detail, we jointly optimize the dynamic deployment and trajectory of UAV swarms, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to concurrently minimize the energy consumption of UAV swarms and GUs, as well as the delay of GUs. However, the proposed MOP is a mixed integer nonlinear programming and NP-hard to solve. Therefore, we develop a K-means and Voronoi diagram based area division method, and construct Fermat points to establish connections between GUs and T-UAVs. Then, an improved non-dominated sorting whale optimization algorithm is proposed to seek Pareto optimal solutions for the transformed MOP. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the performance of proposed algorithms by comparing with baseline mechanisms, resulting in a 50% complexity reduction.</description>

      <title>Toward Edge General Intelligence with Agentic AI and Agentification: Concepts, Technologies, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks and the Internet of Things (IoT) has catalyzed the evolution from centralized cloud intelligence towards decentralized edge general intelligence. However, traditional edge intelligence methods, characterized by static models and limited cognitive autonomy, fail to address the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained scenarios inherent to emerging edge networks. Agentic artificial intelligence (Agentic AI) emerges as a transformative solution, enabling edge systems to autonomously perceive multimodal environments, reason contextually, and adapt proactively through continuous perception-reasoning-action loops. In this context, the agentification of edge intelligence serves as a key paradigm shift, where distributed entities evolve into autonomous agents capable of collaboration and continual adaptation. This paper presents a comprehensive survey dedicated to Agentic AI and agentification frameworks tailored explicitly for edge general intelligence. First, we systematically introduce foundational concepts and clarify distinctions from traditional edge intelligence paradigms. Second, we analyze important enabling technologies, including compact model compression, energy-aware computing strategies, robust connectivity frameworks, and advanced knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms. Third, we provide representative case studies demonstrating Agentic AI's capabilities in low-altitude economy networks, intent-driven networking, vehicular networks, and human-centric service provisioning, supported by numerical evaluations. Furthermore, we identify current research challenges, review emerging open-source platforms, and highlight promising future research directions to guide robust, scalable, and trustworthy Agentic AI deployments for next-generation edge environments.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Cloud-Edge-Terminal Collaborative Intelligence in AIoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of things (IoT) devices in smart cities, transportation, healthcare, and industrial applications, coupled with the explosive growth of AI-driven services, has increased demands for efficient distributed computing architectures and networks, driving cloud-edge-terminal collaborative intelligence (CETCI) as a fundamental paradigm within the artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) community. With advancements in deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and edge computing, CETCI has made significant progress with emerging AIoT applications, moving beyond isolated layer optimization to deployable collaborative intelligence systems for AIoT (CISAIOT), a practical research focus in AI, distributed computing, and communications. This survey describes foundational architectures, enabling technologies, and scenarios of CETCI paradigms, offering a tutorial-style review for CISAIOT beginners. We systematically analyze architectural components spanning cloud, edge, and terminal layers, examining core technologies including network virtualization, container orchestration, and software-defined networking, while presenting categorizations of collaboration paradigms that cover task offloading, resource allocation, and optimization across heterogeneous infrastructures. Furthermore, we explain intelligent collaboration learning frameworks by reviewing advances in federated learning, distributed deep learning, edge-cloud model evolution, and reinforcement learning-based methods. Finally, we discuss challenges (e.g., scalability, heterogeneity, interoperability) and future trends (e.g., 6G+, agents, quantum computing, digital twin), highlighting how integration of distributed computing and communication can address open issues and guide development of robust, efficient, and secure collaborative AIoT systems.</description>

      <title>Network Calculus Results for TSN: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards that enables the industry to provide real-time guarantees for time-critical communications with Ethernet hardware. TSN supports various queuing and scheduling mechanisms and allows the integration of multiple traffic types in a single network. Network Calculus (NC) can be used to calculate upper bounds for latencies and buffer sizes within these networks, for example, for safety or real-time traffic. We explain the relevance of NC for TSN-based computer communications and potential areas of application. Different NC analysis approaches have been published to examine different parts of TSN and this paper provides a survey of these publications and presents their main results, dependencies, and differences. We present a consistent presentation of the most important results and suggest an improvement to model the output of sending end-devices. To ease access to the current research status, we introduce a common notation to show how all results depend on each other and also identify common assumptions. Thus, we offer a comprehensive overview of NC for industrial networks and identify possible areas for future work.</description>

      <title>Saving Energy with Relaxed Latency Constraints: A Study on Data Compression and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of edge computing, data generated by end devices can be pre-processed before transmission, possibly saving transmission time and energy. On the other hand, data processing itself incurs latency and energy consumption, depending on the complexity of the computing operations and the speed of the processor. The energy-latency-reliability profile resulting from the concatenation of pre-processing operations (specifically, data compression) and data transmission is particularly relevant in wireless communication services, whose requirements may change dramatically with the application domain. In this paper, we study this multi-dimensional optimization problem, introducing a simple model to investigate the tradeoff among end-to-end latency, reliability, and energy consumption when considering compression and communication operations in a constrained wireless device. We then study the Pareto fronts of the energy-latency trade-off, considering data compression ratio and device processing speed as key design variables. Our results show that the energy costs grows exponentially with the reduction of the end-to-end latency, so that considerable energy saving can be obtained by slightly relaxing the latency requirements of applications. These findings challenge conventional rigid communication latency targets, advocating instead for application-specific end-to-end latency budgets that account for computational and transmission overhead.</description>

      <title>Combining Static and Dynamic Traffic with Delay Guarantees in Time-Sensitive Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To support reliable and low-latency communication, Time-Sensitive Networking introduced protocols and interfaces for resource allocation in Ethernet. However, the implementation of these allocation algorithms has not yet been covered by the standards. Our work focuses on deadline-guaranteeing resource allocation for networks with static and dynamic traffic. To achieve this, we combine offline network optimization heuristics with online admission control and, thus, allow for new flow registrations while the network is running. We demonstrate our solution on Credit-Based Shaper networks by using the delay analysis framework Network Calculus. We compare our approach with an intuitive and a brute-force algorithm, where we can achieve significant improvements, both, in terms of quality and runtime. Thereby, our results show that we can guarantee maximum end-to-end delays and also increase the flexibility of the network while requiring only minimal user input.</description>

      <title>Adaptive 6G Networks-in-Network Management for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) for future 6G industrial networks, establishing an efficient controller for the Networks-in-Network (NiN) concept. The proposed architecture integrates nomadic as well as static sub-networks (SNs with diverse Quality of Service (QoS) requirements within the coverage area of an overlayer network, managed by a centralized spectrum manager (SM). Control plane connectivity between the SNs and the DSM is ensured by the self-organizing KIRA routing protocol. The demonstrated system enables scalable, zero-touch connectivity and supports nomadic SNs through seamless discovery and reconfiguration. SNs are implemented for modular Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) scenarios, as well as for mission-critical control loops and for logistics or nomadic behavior. The DSM framework dynamically adapts spectrum allocation to meet real-time demands while ensuring reliable operation. The demonstration highlights the potential of DSM and NiNs to support flexible, dense, and heterogeneous wireless deployments in reconfigurable manufacturing environments.</description>

      <title>LeoTCP: Low-Latency and High-Throughput Data Transport for LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks consist of thousands of satellites orbiting the Earth, enabling low-latency and high-throughput communications across the globe. Such networks present unprecedented challenges due to their dynamic nature, which state-of-the-art data transport protocols do not address. These challenges include: (1) non-congestive latency variation and loss, caused by continuous satellite movement and fluctuating link quality due to weather effects; (2) transient hotspots leading to buffer build-up, latency inflation, and potential packet loss; and (3) frequent handovers, which may result in temporary connectivity loss and re-routing through paths with unknown congestion and delay characteristics. In this paper, we introduce LeoTCP, a novel data transport protocol designed specifically to address these challenges. LeoTCP leverages in-network telemetry (INT) to gather congestion information on a per-hop basis. Using this information, LeoTCP (1) minimises both buffer occupancy and latency for end users, (2) maximises application throughput and network utilisation, and (3) swiftly reacts to network hotspots. We compare LeoTCP to state-of-the-art data transport protocols using a LEO satellite simulation model and targeted micro-benchmarks, both based on OMNeT++/INET. The simulation model captures RTT dynamics in a simulated LEO satellite constellation, while the micro-benchmarks isolate key LEO-specific characteristics, including non-congestive latency variation and loss, path changes, and congestion hotspots. Our results demonstrate that LeoTCP significantly increases goodput compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, while simultaneously minimising latency.</description>

      <title>Sharing is Caring: Analysis of Hybrid Network Sharing Strategies for Energy Efficient Multi-Operator Cellular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel analytical framework for evaluating energy-efficient, QoS-aware network-sharing strategies in cellular networks. Leveraging stochastic geometry, our framework enables the systematic assessment of network performance across a range of sharing paradigms, including both conventional single-operator scenarios and advanced hybrid strategies that enable full integration and cooperation among multiple mobile network operators. Our framework incorporates diverse user densities, rate requirements, and energy consumption models to ensure comprehensive analysis. Applying our results to real-world datasets from French mobile network operators, we demonstrate that hybrid network sharing can yield substantial energy savings, up to $35\%$, while maintaining quality of service. Furthermore, our results allow us to characterizing how the benefits of network sharing vary as a function of the geographical and functional characteristics of the deployment area. These findings highlight the potential of collaborative sharing strategies to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability in next-generation cellular networks.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Goal-Oriented Medium Access: Protocol Design and Distributed Bandit Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) paradigm breaks the separation between communication and the content of the data, tailoring communication decisions to the specific needs of the receiver and targeting application performance. While recent studies show impressive encoding performance in point-to-point scenarios, the multi-node distributed scenario is still almost unexplored. Moreover, the few studies to investigate this consider a centralized collision-free approach, where a central scheduler decides the transmission order of the nodes. In this work, we address the Goal-oriented Multiple Access (GoMA) problem, in which multiple intelligent agents must coordinate to share a wireless channel and avoid mutual interference. We propose a theoretical framework for the analysis and optimization of distributed GoMA, serving as a first step towards its complete characterization. We prove that the problem is non-convex and may admit multiple Nash Equilibrium (NE) solutions. We provide a characterization of each node's best response to others' strategies and propose an optimization approach that provably reaches one such NE, outperforming centralized approaches by up to 100% while also reducing energy consumption. We also design a distributed learning algorithm that operates with limited feedback and no prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Not All Visitors are Bilingual: A Measurement Study of the Multilingual Web from an Accessibility Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: English is the predominant language on the web, powering nearly half of the world's top ten million websites. Support for multilingual content is nevertheless growing, with many websites increasingly combining English with regional or native languages in both visible content and hidden metadata. This multilingualism introduces significant barriers for users with visual impairments, as assistive technologies like screen readers frequently lack robust support for non-Latin scripts and misrender or mispronounce non-English text, compounding accessibility challenges across diverse linguistic contexts. Yet, large-scale studies of this issue have been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets on multilingual web content. To address this gap, we introduce LangCrUX, the first large-scale dataset of 120,000 popular websites across 12 languages that primarily use non-Latin scripts. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis of multilingual web accessibility and uncover widespread neglect of accessibility hints. We find that these hints often fail to reflect the language diversity of visible content, reducing the effectiveness of screen readers and limiting web accessibility. We finally propose Kizuki, a language-aware automated accessibility testing extension to account for the limited utility of language-inconsistent accessibility hints.</description>

      <title>GeNet: A Multimodal LLM-Based Co-Pilot for Network Topology and Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Communication network engineering in enterprise environments is traditionally a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone manual process. Most research on network engineering automation has concentrated on configuration synthesis, often overlooking changes in the physical network topology. This paper introduces GeNet, a multimodal co-pilot for enterprise network engineers. GeNet is a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to streamline network design workflows. It uses visual and textual modalities to interpret and update network topologies and device configurations based on user intents. GeNet was evaluated on enterprise network scenarios adapted from Cisco certification exercises. Our results demonstrate GeNet's ability to interpret network topology images accurately, potentially reducing network engineers' efforts and accelerating network design processes in enterprise environments. Furthermore, we show the importance of precise topology understanding when handling intents that require modifications to the network's topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study discusses the current state of FSO technology, as well as global trends and developments in the industrial ecosystem to identify obstacles to the full realization of optical space-to-ground communication networks. Additionally, link performance and network availability trade-off studies are presented, comparing overall system performance between portable and large OGS networks in conjunction with a constellation of small low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The paper provides an up-to-date overview and critical analysis of the FSO industry and assesses the feasibility of low-cost portable terminals as an alternative to larger high-capacity OGS systems. This initiative aims to better inform optical communications stakeholders, including governments, academic institutions, satellite operators, manufacturers, and communication service providers</description>
