      <title>The singlet scalar state in a chiral ensemble in $SU(2)$ with two fundamental flavours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite Higgs models are a class of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) models proposed to address the hierarchy and naturalness problems associated with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs. A new QCD-like strongly interacting sector based on $SU(2)$ with two fundamental flavours can be used to build a composite Higgs model which is not yet ruled out by experiment. The role of the singlet scalar resonance will affect Higgs phenomenology at the LHC. In this project our goal is to understand the properties of the singlet scalar state in the new strongly interacting sector in isolation as a first step to understanding the role of this state in composite Higgs models. We present here the first lattice results for the mass of the $\sigma$ in $SU(2)$ with two fundamental flavours using exponential clover Wilson fermions.</description>

      <title>Taste breaking in the minimally doubled Karsten-Wilczek action and its tree-level improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimally doubled fermion actions offer a discretization for two-flavor Quantum Chromodynamics without rooting, but retaining a U(1) chiral symmetry at the same time. The price to pay is a breaking of the hypercubic symmetry, which requires the inclusion and tuning of new counterterms. Similar to staggered quarks, these actions suffer from taste breaking. We perform a mixed action numerical study with the Karsten-Wilczek formulation of minimally doubled fermions on 4stout staggered configurations, generated with physical quark masses, covering a broad range of lattice spacings. We consider a tree-level spatial Naik improvement to mitigate discretization errors. We carry out a non-perturbative tuning of the KW action with and without improvement, and investigate the taste breaking and the approach to the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>QCD Anderson transition with overlap valence quarks on a twisted-mass sea -- an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD Anderson transition by studying the low-lying eigenmodes of the overlap operator in the background of gauge configurations with 2+1+1 quark flavors of twisted-mass Wilson fermions. The mobility edge, below which eigenmodes are localized, is estimated by the inflection point of the relative volume. The analysis of its temperature dependence suggests a close relation of localization to chiral symmetry restoration. We update our previous work [1] by including recent results on lower temperatures and switching to improved estimates of the lattice spacing and pseudocritical temperature respectively pion mass. Contrary to the previous prediction, our the mobility edge estimate does not vanish at the temperature of the chiral phase transition. We discuss a possible scenario, supported by literature, for why this could be the case.

      <title>Low-energy $DD$ scattering in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculation of single-channel $DD$ scattering with quantum numbers $I(J^P)=1(0^+)$ and $0(1^-)$. The calculation is performed on the $2+1$ flavor Wilson-Clover ensembles with a lattice spacing $a\simeq 0.077$ fm and two different pion masses, $m_{\pi}\simeq207$ and $305$ MeV. The scattering parameters are determined using the L\"uscher's finite volume method. Our results indicate weak repulsive interaction in the $1(0^+)$ channel and slightly attractive interaction in the $0(1^-)$ channel. The $S$-wave isovector $DD$ scattering length and effective range, extrapolated to the physical pion mass, are $(-0.26\pm0.05)$ fm and $(-5.5\pm2.1)$ fm, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the current levels of precision reached in the measurement of the muon g-2 by Fermilab, it is essential to control QED and strong isospin breaking corrections to the HVP contribution to the muon g-2. Here we present a number of cross-checks performed on the results for those corrections presented in the BMW's collaboration 2020 computation.</description>

      <title>Isovector axial and pseudoscalar form factors from twisted mass lattice QCD at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the isovector axial, induced pseudoscalar, and pseudoscalar form factors of the nucleon using three twisted-mass fermion ensembles with degenerate up- and down-, strange-, and charm-quarks with masses tuned to their physical values (physical point). The three ensembles have lattice spacing $a$=0.08, 0.068, and 0.057 fm and approximately equal physical volume allowing for the continuum limit to be taken at the physical point. Excited-state contributions to the matrix elements are evaluated using several sink-source separations from 0.5 fm to 1.5 fm and multistate fits. We check the partially conserved axial-vector current (PCAC) hypothesis and the pion pole dominance (PPD) and show that in the continuum limit both relations are satisfied. We provide results at the continuum limit for the isovector nucleon axial charge, axial radius, pion-nucleon coupling constant, and for the induced pseudoscalar form factor at the muon capture point.</description>

      <title>The hyperfine splitting in QCD mesonic screening masses at asymptotically large temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the hyperfine splitting in the QCD flavour non-singlet mesonic screening masses at asymptotically large temperatures. The analytic calculation is carried out in the dimensionally-reduced effective theory where the first non-zero contribution is of $O(g^4)$ in the QCD coupling constant $g$. Apart for its own theoretical interest, this result provides instrumental information to interpret and to parameterize non-perturbative data that are being produced at very high temperatures by numerical simulations of lattice QCD. Indeed, the comparison with existing non-perturbative results shows that higher order (non-perturbative) contributions in $g$ are needed to explain the data up to the highest temperatures explored, which is of the order of the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $B_{l4}$ decays provide an independent determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element$\vert V_{ub} \vert$, a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors is a key ingredient to do that. We present a comprehensive QCD study of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors from the light-cone sum rules approach by introducing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes ($2\pi$DAs), in which the twist three distribution amplitudes are defined and its contributions are calculated as the first time. With the partial decaying fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ decay measured recently by Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 3.93^{+0.45}_{-0.47}\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.51\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ in the predominated region of $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ determined from $B \to \rho l \nu$, in comparing to the "golden" channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, is induced by the finite width and nonresonant effects. We look to the future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays which would help us to reduce the uncertainties by improving our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the $2\pi$DAs via the heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <title>Finite- and infinite-volume study of $DD\pi$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Calculation of heavy meson light-cone distribution amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an approach for calculating heavy quark effective theory (HQET) light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) by employing a sequential effective theory methodology. The theoretical foundation of the framework is established, elucidating how the quasi distribution amplitudes (quasi DAs) with three scales can be utilized to compute HQET LCDAs. We provide theoretical support for this approach by demonstrating the rationale behind devising a hierarchical ordering for the three involved scales, discussing the factorization at each step, clarifying the underlying reason for obtaining HQET LCDAs in the final phase, and addressing potential theoretical challenges. The lattice QCD simulation aspect is explored in detail, and the computations of quasi DAs are presented. We employ three fitting strategies to handle contributions from excited states and extract the bare matrix elements. For renormalization purposes, we apply hybrid renormalization schemes at short and long distance separations. To mitigate long-distance perturbations, we perform an extrapolation in $\lambda= z\cdot P^z$ and assess the stability against various parameters. After two-step matching, our results for HQET LCDAs are found in agreement with existing model parametrizations. The potential phenomenological implications of the results are discussed, shedding light on how these findings could impact our understanding of the strong interaction dynamics and physics beyond the standard model. It should be noted, however, that systematic uncertainties have not been accounted for yet.</description>

      <title>A Simple Parametrisation of the Pion Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel and simple parametrisation of the pion vector form factor that transparently connects spacelike and timelike regions of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Our parametrisation employs the framework of conformal mapping and respects the known analyticity properties of the form factor, accounting explicitly for the $\rho(770)$-meson pole. The parametrisation manifestly fulfils the normalisation condition at $q^2 = 0$ as well as further restrictions at the pion production threshold and in the limit $|q^2| \to \infty$. In contrast to the widely used Omn\`es parametrisation, our approach does not use the pion-pion scattering phase shift as input. We confront the parametrisation with experimental data from $\pi H$ scattering and $\tau^- \to \pi^-\pi^0\nu$ decay. We already find a good description of the data with only five free parameters, which include the pole mass and decay width of the $\rho(770)$.</description>

      <title>String Breaking in the Heavy Quark Limit with Scalable Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of non-Abelian gauge theories require efficient mappings onto quantum computers and practical state preparation and measurement procedures. A truncation of the Hilbert space of non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter in the heavy quark limit is developed. This truncation is applied to $SU(2)$ lattice gauge theory in $1+1D$ to map the theory efficiently onto a quantum computer. Scalable variational circuits are found to prepare the vacuum and single meson states. It is also shown how these state preparation circuits can be used to perform measurements of the number of mesons produced during the system's time evolution. A state with a single $q\overline{q}$ pair is prepared on quantum hardware and the inelastic production of $q\overline{q}$ pairs is observed using $104$ qubits on IBM's Heron quantum computer ibm_torino.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inferring Nucleon's Gravitation Form Factors via Near-threshold $J/\psi$ Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of recent near-threshold $J/\psi$ production measurements by the $J/\psi$ 007 experiment and GlueX collaboration on the extraction of proton's gravitational form factors. We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next-to-leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative $C_q(t)$ and $C_g(t)$ are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.</description>
