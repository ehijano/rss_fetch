      <title>Personalized and uncertainty-aware coronary hemodynamics simulations: From Bayesian estimation to improved multi-fidelity uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of coronary hemodynamics have improved non-invasive clinical risk stratification and treatment outcomes for coronary artery disease, compared to relying on anatomical imaging alone. However, simulations typically use empirical approaches to distribute total coronary flow amongst the arteries in the coronary tree. This ignores patient variability, the presence of disease, and other clinical factors. Further, uncertainty in the clinical data often remains unaccounted for in the modeling pipeline. We present an end-to-end uncertainty-aware pipeline to (1) personalize coronary flow simulations by incorporating branch-specific coronary flows as well as cardiac function; and (2) predict clinical and biomechanical quantities of interest with improved precision, while accounting for uncertainty in the clinical data. We assimilate patient-specific measurements of myocardial blood flow from CT myocardial perfusion imaging to estimate branch-specific coronary flows. We use adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the joint posterior distributions of model parameters with simulated noise in the clinical data. Additionally, we determine the posterior predictive distribution for relevant quantities of interest using a new approach combining multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimation with non-linear, data-driven dimensionality reduction. Our framework recapitulates clinically measured cardiac function as well as branch-specific coronary flows under measurement uncertainty. We substantially shrink the confidence intervals for estimated quantities of interest compared to single-fidelity and state-of-the-art multi-fidelity Monte Carlo methods. This is especially true for quantities that showed limited correlation between the low- and high-fidelity model predictions. Moreover, the proposed estimators are significantly cheaper to compute for a specified confidence level or variance.</description>

      <title>A generalized adaptive central-upwind scheme for compressible flow simulations and preventing spurious vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel adaptive central-upwind scheme designed for simulating compressible flows with discontinuities in the flow field. The proposed approach offers significant improvements in computational efficiency over the central gradient-based reconstruction approach presented in [1] (Hoffmann, Chamarthi and Frankel, JCP 2024). By leveraging a combination of conservative and characteristic variable reconstruction, the proposed approach demonstrates oscillation-free results while effectively reducing computational costs and improving the results. Furthermore, the adaptive central-upwind algorithm is generalized to be compatible not only with the gradient-based reconstruction as in [1] but with other existing methods. In this regard, with the proposed algorithm, the standard fifth/sixth-order reconstruction scheme has also been shown to outperform existing schemes with a 20-30% reduction in computational expense with improved results. Notably, the proposed approach has successfully prevented the generation of spurious vortices in the double shear layer test cases, even with linear schemes, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Investigation of cloud cavitating flow in a venturi using Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsteady cloud cavitating flow is detrimental to the efficiency of hydraulic machinery like pumps and propellers due to the resulting side-effects of vibration, noise and erosion damage. Modelling such a unsteady and highly turbulent flow remains a challenging issue. In this paper, cloud cavitating flow in a venturi is calculated using the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) model combined with the Merkle model. The Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) method is employed to speed up the calculation and investigate the mechanisms for vortex development in the venturi. The results indicate the velocity gradients and the generalized fluid element strongly influence the formation of vortices throughout a cavitation cycle. In addition, the cavitation-turbulence coupling is investigated on the local scale by comparing with high-fidelity experimental data and using profile stations. While the AMR calculation is able to predict well the time-averaged velocities and turbulence-related aspects near the throat, it displays discrepancies further downstream owing to a coarser grid refinement downstream and under-performs compared to a traditional grid simulation . Additionally, the AMR calculations is unable to reproduce the cavity width as observed in the experiments. Therefore, while AMR promises to speed the process significantly by refining grid only in regions of interest, it is comparatively in line with a traditional calculation for cavitating flows. Thus, this study intends to provide a reference to employing AMR as a tool to speed up calculations and be able to simulate turbulence-cavitation interactions accurately.</description>

      <title>Inertial focusing of spherical capsule in pulsatile channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical analysis of the lateral movement of spherical capsule in the steady and pulsatile channel flow of a Newtonian fluid, for a wide range of oscillatory frequency. Each capsule membrane satisfying strain-hardening characteristic is simulated for different Reynolds numbers Re and capillary numbers Ca. Our numerical results showed that capsules with high Ca exhibit axial focusing at finite Re similarly to the inertialess case. We observe that the speed of the axial focusing can be substantially accelerated by making the driving pressure gradient oscillating in time. We also confirm the existence of an optimal frequency which maximizes the speed of axial focusing, that remains the same found in the absence of inertia. For relatively low Ca, on the other hand, the capsule exhibits off-centre focusing, resulting in various equilibrium radial positions depending on Re. Our numerical results further clarifies the existence of a specific Re for which the effect of the flow pulsation to the equilibrium radial position is maximum. The roles of channel size and viscosity ratio on the lateral movements of the capsule are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-limited settling of highly porous particles in density-stratified fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vertical transport of solid material in a stratified medium is fundamental to a number of environmental applications, with implications for the carbon cycle and nutrient transport in marine ecosystems. In this work, we study the diffusion-limited settling of highly porous particles in a density-stratified fluid through a combination of experiment, analysis, and numerical simulation. By delineating and appealing to the diffusion-limited regime wherein buoyancy effects due to mass adaptation dominate hydrodynamic drag, we derive a simple expression for the steady settling velocity of a sphere as a function of the density, size, and diffusivity of the solid, as well as the density gradient of the background fluid. In this regime, smaller particles settle faster, in contrast with most conventional hydrodynamic drag mechanisms. Furthermore, we outline a general mathematical framework for computing the steady settling speed of a body of arbitrary shape in this regime and compute exact results for the case of general ellipsoids. Using hydrogels as a highly porous model system, we validate the predictions with laboratory experiments in linear stratification for a wide range of parameters. Lastly, we show how the predictions can be applied to arbitrary slowly varying background density profiles and demonstrate how a measured particle position over time can be used to reconstruct the background density profile.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-size particles in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fluid-solid interaction of suspensions of Kolmogorov-size spherical particles moving in homogeneous isotropic turbulence at a microscale Reynolds number of $Re_\lambda \approx 140$. Two volume fractions are considered, $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-3}$, and the solid-to-fluid density ratio is set to $5$ and $100$. We present a comparison between interface-resolved (PR-DNS) and one-way-coupled point-particle (PP-DNS) direct numerical simulations. We find that the modulated energy spectrum shows the classical $-5/3$ Kolmogorov scaling in the inertial range of scales and a $-4$ scaling at smaller scales, with the latter resulting from a balance between the energy injected by the particles and the viscous dissipation, in an otherwise smooth flow. An analysis of the small-scale flow topology shows that the particles mainly favour events with axial strain and vortex compression. The dynamics of the particles and their collective motion studied for PR-DNS are used to assess the validity of the PP-DNS. We find that the PP-DNS predicts fairly well both the Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics of the particles motion for the low-density case, while some discrepancies are observed for the high-density case. Also, the PP-DNS is found to underpredict the level of clustering of the suspension compared to the PR-DNS, with a larger difference for the high-density case.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity at a gallium-mercury liquid metal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermoelectric effect at the interface between two liquid metals. Using superimposed layers of mercury and gallium in a cylindrical vessel operating at room temperature, we provide a direct measurement of the electric current generated by the presence of a thermal gradient along a liquid-liquid interface. At the interface between two liquids, temperature gradients induced by thermal convection lead to a complex geometry of electric currents, ultimately generating current densities near boundaries that are significantly higher than those observed in conventional solid-state thermoelectricity. When a magnetic field is applied to the experiment, an azimuthal shear flow, exhibiting opposite circulation in each layer, is generated. Depending on the value of the magnetic field, two different flow regimes are identified, in good agreement with a model based on the spatial distribution of thermoelectric currents, which has no equivalent in solid systems. Finally, we discuss various applications of this new effect, such as the efficiency of liquid metal batteries.</description>

      <title>Generation Model of a Spatially Limited Vortex in a Stratified Unstable Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model for the generation of axisymmetric concentrated vortices. The solution of a nonlinear equation for internal gravity waves in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The corresponding expressions describing the dependences on the radius for the radial and vertical velocity components in the inner and outer regions of the vortex include combinations of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. The proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study the structure and nonlinear dynamics of vortices in the radial and vertical regions. The vortex is limited in height. The maximum vertical velocity component is reached at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the axis, and above it, an outflow occurs. The resulting instability in the stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocity components according to the hyperbolic sine law, which turns into exponential growth. The characteristic growth time is determined by the inverse growth rate of the instability. The formation of vortices with finite velocity components, which increase with time, is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can change with height. The maximum rotation is reached at a certain height. The growth of the azimuth velocity occurs according to a super-exponential law.</description>

      <title>Development of the Multichannel Pulsed Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimeter for the measurement of liquid metal flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, by adopting the advantage of ultrasonic techniques, we developed a Multichannel Pulsed Ultrasonic Doppler Velocimetry (MPUDV) to measure the 2D2C velocity fields of liquid metal flow. Due to the specially designed Ultrasonic host and post-processing scheme, the MPUDV system can reach a high spatiotemporal resolution of 50 Hz and 3 mm. The flow loop contains a cavity test section to ensure a classical recirculating flow was built to validate the accuracy of MPUDV in velocity field measurement. In the initial phase of the study, water with tracer particles was selected as the working liquid to ensure the velocity field measurements by the well-developed Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). A comparison of the data obtained from the PIV and MPUDV methods revealed less than 3 differences in the 2D2C velocity field between the two techniques during simultaneous measurements of the same flow field. This finding strongly demonstrates the reliability of the MPUDV method developed in this paper. Moreover, the ternary alloy GaInSn was selected as the working liquid in the flow loop to validate the efficacy of the MPUDV in measuring 2D-2C velocity fields. A series of tests were conducted in the cavity at varying Reynolds numbers, ranging from 9103 to 24123. The measurements demonstrated that the MPUDV could accurately measure the flow structures characterized by a central primary circulation eddy and two secondary eddies in the opaque liquid metal. Furthermore, it was found that the vortex center of the primary circulating eddy and the size of the secondary eddies undergo significant alterations with varying Reynolds numbers, indicating the influence of inertial force on the flow characteristics in the recirculating flow. It is therefore demonstrated that the current MPUDV methodology is applicable for measuring a 2D2C velocity field in opaque liquid metal flows.</description>

Abstract: Over a wide range of viscosities, a perturbed trefoil vortex knot generates Reynolds number independent finite-time energy dissipation $\Delta E_\epsilon$ (1) with evidence for a transient Kolmogorov spectra at the highest Reynolds number. Satisfying one definition for a dissipation anomaly. To cover the required range of Reynolds numbers, factors of $\nu^{1/4}$ must be considered for both the largest scale $L$, the size of the periodic domain, which increases as $L\sim\nu^{-1/4}$, and vorticity moments at the the earliest times, which converge when scaled as $\nu^{1/4}\Omega_m$, including $m=9,\infty$ at times $t_\infty&lt;\dots&lt;t_m\dots t_1=t_x$. The $\nu^{1/4}$ scaling ends at $t=t_x$ with convergence of $\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$, $Z=L^3\Omega_1^2$ being the volume-integrated enstrophy, after which the growth of $Z(t)$ accelerates until there is approximate convergence of the dissipation rates $\epsilon=\nu Z$ at $t\sim t_\epsilon\sim2t_x$. This continues long enough to generate a dissipation anomaly with finite $\Delta E_\epsilon$ (1). To achieve the convergence of $\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$ at $t_x$, $L$ is increased from $4\pi$ to $12\pi$, meaning that the following restriction must be addressed: That $\nu\ne0$ Navier-Stokes solutions in $(2\pi)^3$ periodic domains are bounded by their $\nu\equiv0$ Euler solutions as $\nu\to0$ for $\nu&lt;\nu_s$, with the bounding critical viscosities $\nu_s$ determined using Sobolev space analysis. By rescaling the original Sobolev space result in $(2\pi)^3$ into larger $(2\ell\pi)^3$ domains, a reduction in the bounding critical viscosities $\nu_s$ can be shown which allows growth of $Z(t)$ in those domains.</description>

      <title>Natural convection in a vertical channel. Part 2. Oblique solutions and global bifurcations in a spanwise-extended domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical thermal convection is a non-equilibrium system in which both buoyancy and shear forces play a role in driving the convective flow. Beyond the onset of convection, the driven dissipative system exhibits chaotic dynamics and turbulence. In a three-dimensional domain extended in both the vertical and the transverse dimensions, Gao et al. (2018) have observed a variety of convection patterns which are not described by linear stability analysis. We investigate the fully non-linear dynamics of vertical convection using a dynamical-systems approach based on the Oberbeck-Boussinesq equations. We compute the invariant solutions of these equations and the bifurcations that are responsible for the creation and termination of various branches. We map out a sequence of local bifurcations from the laminar base state, including simultaneous bifurcations involving patterned steady states with different symmetries. This atypical phenomenon of multiple branches simultaneously bifurcating from a single parent branch is explained by the role of D4 symmetry. In addition, two global bifurcations are identified: first, a homoclinic cycle from modulated transverse rolls and second, a heteroclinic cycle linking two symmetry-related diamond-roll patterns. These are confirmed by phase space projections as well as the functional form of the divergence of the period close to the bifurcation points. The heteroclinic orbit is shown to be robust and to result from a 1:2 mode interaction. The intricacy of this bifurcation diagram highlights the essential role played by dynamical systems theory and computation in hydrodynamic configurations.</description>

      <title>Resolving turbulence and drag over textured surfaces using texture-less simulations: the case of slip/no-slip textures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of surface texture on an overlying turbulent flow for textures made of an alternating slip/no-slip pattern, a common model for superhydrophobic surfaces, but also a particularly simple form of texture. For texture sizes $L^+ \gtrsim 25$, the texture effectively imposes homogeneous slip boundary conditions on the overlying, background turbulence, but this is not its sole effect. The effective conditions only produce an origin offset on the background turbulence, which remains otherwise smooth-wall-like. For actual textures, however, for $L^+ \gtrsim 25$ the flow progressively departs from this smooth-wall-like regime, resulting in additional shear Reynolds stress and increased drag, in a non-homogeneous fashion not reproduced by the effective boundary conditions. We focus on the underlying physical mechanism of this phenomenon. We argue that it is caused by the non-linear interaction of the texture-coherent flow, directly induced by the surface topology, and the background turbulence, as it acts directly on the latter and alters it, not at the boundary where effective conditions are imposed, but within the flow itself. The interaction acts as a forcing on the governing equations of the background turbulence, and takes the form of cross-advective terms between the latter and the texture-coherent flow. We show this with simulations with the texture removed and additional, forcing terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, in addition to the effective boundary conditions. The forcing captures the effect of the non-linear interaction on the background turbulence without the need to resolve the texture. When the forcing is derived accounting for the background turbulence amplitude-modulating the texture-coherent flow, it captures the changes in the flow up to $L^+ \approx 70$--$100$, including the roughness function and also the changes in the flow statistics and structure.</description>

Abstract: Vorticity is locally created on a boundary at the rate measured by the boundary vorticity flux, which can be further decomposed as the sum of the orbital rotation and the (generalized) spin. For incompressible viscous flow interacting with a stationary wall, the full expressions of the boundary fluxes of the orbital rotation and the spin are derived, for the first time, to elucidate their boundary creation mechanisms, respectively. Then, these new findings are successfully extended to the study of the boundary enstrophy dynamics, as well as the Lyman vorticity dynamics as an alternative interpretation to the boundary vorticity dynamics. Interestingly, it is found that the boundary coupling of the longitudinal and transverse processes is only embodied in the boundary spin flux, which is definitely not responsible for the generation of the boundary orbital-rotation flux. In addition, the boundary fluxes of enstrophy are directly associated with the boundary source of the second principal invariant of the velocity gradient tensor, and the two quadratic forms representing the spin-geometry interaction. The present exposition provides a new perspective to the vorticity dynamics on boundaries, which could be valuable in clarifying the formation mechanisms of near-wall coherent structures and flow noise at the fundamental level.</description>

Abstract: Fluid flow through bimodal porous media, characterized by a distinct separation in pore size distribution, is critical in various scientific and engineering applications, including groundwater management, oil and gas production, and carbon sequestration. This note delves into the physical similarity of fluid flow within such media, bridging the gap between microscale phenomena and macroscale observations. We present a representative mathematical model that conceptualizes bimodal porous media as a double-continuum system, distinguishing between macroporous and microporous regions. The model captures the complex interactions between these regions, particularly focusing on the challenges of modeling fluid flow when there is significant disparity in pore sizes. By employing a heuristic approach grounded in pore-scale tomography, we derive governing equations that describe fluid flow and analyze the solution characteristics. The results reveal unique features of the fluid flow in bimodal systems, such as the occurrence of boundary discontinuities and the delayed transient response, which are not observed in conventional porous media. This work provides ground for further studies in bimodal porous media, offering insights that could enhance predictive modeling and optimization in various applications concerning porous media with similar bimodal pore size distributions.</description>
