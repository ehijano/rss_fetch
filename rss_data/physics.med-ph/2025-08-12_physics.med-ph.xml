      <title>Experimental plasmonic sensing of malaria using an aluminum metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of methods currently exist for testing the presence of malaria, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. New technologies are urgently needed to develop more effective diagnosis tools to fight and eradicate malaria. Optical biosensors that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are a promising category of devices for detecting malaria biomarkers. One such biomarker is plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), a protein produced during the life cycle of the malaria parasite, which is a metabolic enzyme found in all plasmodium species, including the most widespread falciparum. This work reports on the design, probing, and experimental performance of an optical biosensor for detecting pLDH based on SPR and extraordinary optical transmission. The biosensor is composed of an aluminum metasurface made from an array of nanoholes. The sensor operates in the visible spectral region and achieves label-free sensing of plasmodium falciparum LDH (pfLDH) spiked in phosphate-buffered saline. The sensor has a spectral sensitivity of 360 nm/RIU and an LOD of 1.3 nM, equivalent to 45.6 ng/mL of pfLDH. This type of optical biosensor may offer a cost-effective and high sensitivity method for active infection diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Detecting Early Kidney Allograft Fibrosis with Multi-b-value Spectral Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kidney allograft fibrosis is a marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and predicts functional decline, and eventual allograft failure. This study evaluates if spectral diffusion MRI can help detect early development and mild/moderate fibrosis in kidney allografts. In a prospective two-center study of kidney allografts, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) was scored and eGFR was calculated from serum creatinine. Multi-b-value DWI (bvalues=[0,10,30,50,80,120,200,400,800mm2/s]) was post-processed with spectral diffusion, intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Connection between imaging parameters and biological processes was measured by Mann-Whitney U-test and Spearman's rank; diagnostic ability was measured by five-fold cross-validation univariate and multi-variate logistic regression. Quality control analyses included volunteer MRI (n=4) and inter-observer analysis (n=19). 99 patients were included (50$\pm$13yo, 64M/35F, 39 IFTA=0, 22 IFTA=2, 20 IFTA=4, 18 IFTA=6, 46 eGFR&lt;=45mL/min/1.73m2, mean eGFR=47.5$\pm$21.3mL/min/1.73m2). Spectral diffusion detected fibrosis (IFTA&gt;0) in patients with normal/stable eGFR&gt;45ml/min/1.73m2 [AUC(95$\%$CI)=0.72(0.56,0.87),p=0.007]. Spectral diffusion detected mild/moderate fibrosis (IFTA=2-4) [AUC(95$\%$CI)=0.65(0.52,0.71),p=0.023], as did ADC [AUC(95$\%$CI)=0.71(0.54,0.87),p=0.013)]. eGFR, time-from-transplant, and allograft size could not. Interobserver correlation was &gt;0.50 in 24 out of 40 diffusion parameters. Spectral diffusion MRI showed detection of mild/moderate fibrosis and fibrosis before decline in function. It is a promising method to detect early development of fibrosis and CKD before progression.</description>

      <title>Computational modeling of Pulsed Field Ablation for pulmonary vein isolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) has emerged as a non-thermal alternative to traditional thermal ablation techniques for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study presents a patient-specific 3D computational framework to model the effects of PFA on pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). The modeling framework is rigorously validated against published numerical and experimental data, demonstrating strong agreement across a range of scenarios. Using realistic left atrial (LA) anatomy, commercially available circular, flower, and basket catheter configurations are simulated to evaluate lesion formation across different applied voltages. The performance of each catheter type is quantitatively assessed using multiple metrics, including lesion volume, energy delivery efficiency and transmurality. Simulation results show that circular catheters provide the highest energy delivery efficiency and target coverage at lower voltages, while basket catheters produce the largest lesion volumes. This framework offers a useful basis for exploring catheter design and treatment planning in PFA applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Strategies for Personalized Radiation Therapy: Part III Identifying genetic determinants for Radiation Response with Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation response in cancer is shaped by complex, patient specific biology, yet current treatment strategies often rely on uniform dose prescriptions without accounting for tumor heterogeneity. In this study, we introduce a meta learning framework for one-shot prediction of radiosensitivity measured by SF2 using cell line level gene expression data. Unlike the widely used Radiosensitivity Index RSI a rank-based linear model trained on a fixed 10-gene signature, our proposed meta-learned model allows the importance of each gene to vary by sample through fine tuning. This flexibility addresses key limitations of static models like RSI, which assume uniform gene contributions across tumor types and discard expression magnitude and gene gene interactions. Our results show that meta learning offers robust generalization to unseen samples and performs well in tumor subgroups with high radiosensitivity variability, such as adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. By learning transferable structure across tasks while preserving sample specific adaptability, our approach enables rapid adaptation to individual samples, improving predictive accuracy across diverse tumor subtypes while uncovering context dependent patterns of gene influence that may inform personalized therapy.</description>

      <title>A Computational Optimisation Study of Hip Implant Using Density Mapping Functionally Graded Biomimetic TPMS-based Lattice Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a computational optimisation framework of a hip implant through the development of a functionally graded biomimetic lattice structure, whose design was structurally optimised to limit stress shielding. The optimisation technique was inspired by the inverse of a bone remodelling algorithm, promoting an even stress distribution throughout the design region, by reducing the density and consequently the stiffness, in regions where strain energy was higher than the reference level. The result of the optimisation technique provided a non-uniform graded density distribution field that showed lower density level on the sides of the implant stem, and higher material density around the medial axis of the stem. The optimised material distribution was captured using mapping of a triply periodic minimal surface lattice structure on the implant, which resulted in porous lattice surfaces inside the solid implant. The performance of the porous implant design was evaluated through implementation of a finite element bone remodelling algorithm and comparing the bone response with a femur with fully solid implant model, in terms of stress distribution and mass change. The results of the analysis showed improved bone formation on the bone-implant interface, and enhanced stress transmission to the surrounding bone from the implant.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Holography in the Megahertz Frequency Range with Optimal Lens Topologies and Nonlinear Acoustic Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic holography in the megahertz frequency range can impact numerous applications, including manufacturing, non-destructive testing, and transcranial ultrasound. However, designing lens topologies for complex acoustic holograms in the megahertz range poses a significant challenge, as weave propagation effects through the lens cannot be ignored. Here, we show that the inherent ability of heterogeneous angular spectrum approach to incorporate in plane varying speed-of-sound maps and support rapid differentiable optimization of lens thickness profiles can generate lens topologies for high fidelity acoustic holography. Crucially, we show that this framework can also account for wavefront aberrations in the propagation media, providing the opportunity to reconfigure this disruptive technology for high precision neuro-interventions. Our investigations also revealed that low frequency acoustic feedback generated by nonlinear mixing of high frequency waves allows attaining accurate skull-compensating lens alignment and creates the possibility to monitor CSF fluid build-up and removal in hydrocephalus. Together, our findings support the design of simple, economical, and high-performance ultrasound systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents an unsupervised deep learning approach for computed tomography (CT) image reconstruction, leveraging the inherent similarities between deep neural network training and conventional iterative reconstruction methods. By incorporating forward and backward projection layers within the deep learning framework, we demonstrate the feasibility of reconstructing images from projection data without relying on ground-truth images. Our method is evaluated on the two-dimensional 2DeteCT dataset, showcasing superior performance in terms of mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index (SSIM) compared to traditional filtered backprojection (FBP) and maximum likelihood (ML) reconstruction techniques. Additionally, our approach significantly reduces reconstruction time, making it a promising alternative for real-time medical imaging applications. Future work will focus on extending this methodology to three-dimensional reconstructions and enhancing the adaptability of the projection geometry.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13477v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can guide the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several end-to-end learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, a key challenge is the requirement of large paired training datasets comprising raw data and aligned reference images. We propose a modular two-stage approach addressing this issue, additionally providing an explanatory framework for the multi-contrast problem based on the shared and non-shared generative factors underlying two given contrasts. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned from a largely unpaired image-domain dataset and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Consequently, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to a simple replacement of the aliased content of the reconstruction iterate with high-quality content derived from the reference scan. Combining this component with a data consistency step and introducing a general corrective process for the content yields an iterative scheme. We name this novel approach PnP-CoSMo. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the public NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset, showing improved generalizability compared to end-to-end methods, and on two in-house multi-coil raw datasets, offering up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM.</description>

      <title>Evaluating structural uncertainty in accelerated MRI: are voxelwise measures useful surrogates?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introducing accelerated reconstruction algorithms into clinical settings requires measures of uncertainty quantification that accurately assess the relevant uncertainty introduced by the reconstruction algorithm. Many currently deployed approaches quantifying uncertainty by focusing on measuring the variability in voxelwise intensity variation. Although these provide interpretable maps, they lack a structural interpretation and do not show a clear relationship to how the data will be analysed subsequently. In this work we show that voxel level uncertainty does not provide insight into morphological uncertainty. To do so, we use segmentation as a clinically-relevant downstream task and deploy ensembles of reconstruction modes to measure uncertainty in the reconstructions. We show that variability and bias in the morphological structures are present and within-ensemble variability cannot be predicted well with uncertainty measured only by voxel intensity variations.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Markers: CFD-Based Prediction of Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of aneurysm evolution on hemodynamic characteristics within the sac region. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), blood flow through the parent vessel and aneurysm sac was analyzed to assess the impact on wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), and the oscillatory shear index (OSI), key indicators of rupture risk. Additionally, Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP) were examined to provide a broader understanding of the aneurysm's hemodynamic environment. Six distinct cerebral aneurysm (CA) models, all from individuals of the same gender, were selected to minimize gender-related variability.
  Results showed that unruptured cases exhibited higher WSS and TAWSS, along with lower OSI and RRT values patterns consistent with stable flow conditions supporting vascular integrity. In contrast, ruptured cases had lower WSS and TAWSS, coupled with elevated OSI and RRT, suggesting disturbed and oscillatory flow commonly linked to aneurysm wall weakening. ECAP was also higher in ruptured cases, indicating increased endothelial activation under unstable flow. Notably, areas with the highest OSI and RRT often aligned with vortex centers, reinforcing the association between disturbed flow and aneurysm instability.
  These findings highlight the value of combining multiple hemodynamic parameters for rupture risk assessment. Including RRT and ECAP provides deeper insight into flow endothelium-interactions, offering a stronger basis for evaluating aneurysm stability and guiding treatment decisions.</description>
