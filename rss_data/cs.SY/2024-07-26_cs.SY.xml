      <title>Competitive Perimeter Defense in Tree Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a perimeter defense problem in a rooted full tree graph environment in which a single defending vehicle seeks to defend a set of specified vertices, termed as the perimeter from mobile intruders that enter the environment through the tree's leaves. We adopt the technique of competitive analysis to characterize the performance of an online algorithm for the defending vehicle. We first derive fundamental limits on the performance of any online algorithm relative to that of an optimal offline algorithm. Specifically, we give three fundamental conditions for finite, 2, and 3/2 competitive ratios in terms of the environment parameters. We then design and analyze three classes of online algorithms that have provably finite competitiveness under varying environmental parameter regimes. Finally, we give a numerical visualization of these regimes to better show the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.</description>

      <title>Robust Iterative Learning for Collaborative Road Profile Estimation and Active Suspension Control in Connected Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a new collaborative road profile estimation and active suspension control framework in connected vehicles, where participating vehicles iteratively refine the road profile estimation and enhance suspension control performance through an iterative learning scheme. Specifically, we develop a robust iterative learning approach to tackle the heterogeneity and model uncertainties in participating vehicles, which are important for practical implementations. In addition, the framework can be adopted as an add-on system to augment existing suspension control schemes. Comprehensive numerical studies are performed to evaluate and validate the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Control Informed Design of the IAC Autonomous Racecar for Operation at the Dynamic Envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the hardware-software co-design of the control system for an autonomy-enabled formula-style high-speed racecar that will be utilized as the deployment platform for high-level autonomy in the first ever head-to-head driverless race called the Indy Autonomous Challenge. The embedded control system needs to facilitate autonomous functionality, including perception, localization, and by-wire actuation, at high speeds and dynamic limits of the vehicle. Rapid maneuvering during the race, however, excites transient dynamics of the vehicle and the actuators. Compared to current autonomous driving focused on highway cruising and urban traffic, transient vehicle control imposes new challenges to the algorithm and system design. The presented work introduces the cascaded control structure employed by the IAC prototype to fully exploit the time scale separation between different control tasks. It is demonstrated by example way how the model-based control strategies and simulation are utilized to inform the decisions in the actuation, computation, perception, and software pipeline design decisions for the first-of-its-kind IAC racecar.</description>

      <title>Pose, Velocity and Landmark Position Estimation Using IMU and Bearing Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the estimation problem of the pose (orientation and position) and linear velocity of a rigid body, as well as the landmark positions, using an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a monocular camera. First, we propose a globally exponentially stable (GES) linear time-varying (LTV) observer for the estimation of body-frame landmark positions and velocity, using IMU and monocular bearing measurements. Thereafter, using the gyro measurements, some landmarks known in the inertial frame and the estimates from the LTV observer, we propose a nonlinear pose observer on $\SO(3)\times \mathbb{R}^3$. The overall estimation system is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable (AGAS) using the notion of almost global input-to-state stability (ISS). Interestingly, we show that with the knowledge (in the inertial frame) of a small number of landmarks, we can recover (under some conditions) the unknown positions (in the inertial frame) of a large number of landmarks. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed estimation scheme.</description>

      <title>Identification of a time-varying SIR Model for Covid-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Throughout human history, epidemics have been a constant presence. Understanding their dynamics is essential to predict scenarios and make substantiated decisions. Mathematical models are powerful tools to describe an epidemic behavior. Among the most used, the compartmental ones stand out, dividing population into classes with well-defined characteristics. One of the most known is the $SIR$ model, based on a set of differential equations describing the rates of change of three categories over time. These equations take into account parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the recovery rate, which both change over time. However, classical models use constant parameters and can not describe the behavior of a disease over long periods. In this work, it is proposed a $SIR$ model with time-varying transmission rate parameter with a method to estimate this parameter based on an optimization problem, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors between the model and historical data. Additionally, based on the infection rates determined by the algorithm, the model's ability to predict disease activity in future scenarios was also investigated. Epidemic data released by the government of the State of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil was used to evaluate the models, where the models shown a very good forecasting ability, resulting in errors for predicting the total number of accumulated infected persons of 0.13% for 7 days ahead and 0.6% for 14 days ahead.</description>

      <title>Optimal Assignment and Motion Control in Two-Class Continuum Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider optimal swarm control problems where two different classes of agents are present. Continuum idealizations of large-scale swarms are used where the dynamics describe the evolution of the spatially-distributed densities of each agent class. The problem formulation we adopt is motivated by applications where agents of one class are assigned to agents of the other class, which we refer to as demand and resource agents respectively. Assignments have costs related to the distances between mutually assigned agents, and the overall cost of an assignment is quantified by a Wasserstein distance between the densities of the two agent classes. When agents can move, the assignment cost can decrease at the expense of a physical motion cost, and this tradeoff sets up a nonlinear, infinite-dimensional optimal control problem. We show that in one spatial dimension, this problem can be converted to an infinite-dimensional, but decoupled, linear-quadratic (LQ) tracking problem when expressed in terms of the respective quantile functions. Solutions are given in the general one-dimensional case, as well as in the special cases of constant and periodically time-varying demands.</description>

      <title>Design, Key Techniques and System-Level Simulation for NB-IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a promising technology designated specially by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to meet the growing demand of massive machine-type communications (mMTC). More and more industrial companies choose NB-IoT network as the solution to mMTC due to its unique design and technical specification released by 3GPP. In order to evaluate the performance of NB-IoT network, we design a system-level simulation for NB-IoT network in this paper. In particular, the structure of system-level simulator are divided into four parts, i.e., initialization, pre-generation, main simulation loop and post-processing. Moreover, three key techniques are developed in the implementation of NB-IoT network by accounting for enhanced coverage, massive connection and low-power consumption. Simulation results demonstrate the cumulative distribution function curves of signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio are fully compliant with industrial standard, and the performance of throughput explains how NB-IoT network realize massive connection at the cost of data rate.</description>

      <title>Time-Optimal Planning for Long-Range Quadrotor Flights: An Automatic Optimal Synthesis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-critical tasks such as drone racing typically cover large operation areas. However, it is difficult and computationally intensive for current time-optimal motion planners to accommodate long flight distances since a large yet unknown number of knot points is required to represent the trajectory. We present a polynomial-based automatic optimal synthesis (AOS) approach that can address this challenge. Our method not only achieves superior time optimality but also maintains a consistently low computational cost across different ranges while considering the full quadrotor dynamics. First, we analyze the properties of time-optimal quadrotor maneuvers to determine the minimal number of polynomial pieces required to capture the dominant structure of time-optimal trajectories. This enables us to represent substantially long minimum-time trajectories with a minimal set of variables. Then, a robust optimization scheme is developed to handle arbitrary start and end conditions as well as intermediate waypoints. Extensive comparisons show that our approach is faster than the state-of-the-art approach by orders of magnitude with comparable time optimality. Real-world experiments further validate the quality of the resulting trajectories, demonstrating aggressive time-optimal maneuvers with a peak velocity of 8.86 m/s.</description>

      <title>Computing an Aircraft's Gliding Range and Minimal Return Altitude in Presence of Obstacles and Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the event of a total loss of thrust a pilot must identify a reachable landing site and subsequently execute a forced landing. To do so this, they must estimate which region on the ground can be reached safely in gliding flight. We call this the gliding reachable region (GRR). To compute the GRR, we employ an optimal control formulation aiming to reach a point in space while minimizing altitude loss. A simplified model of the aircraft's dynamics is used, where the effect of turns is neglected. The resulting equations are discretized on a grid and solved numerically. Our algorithm for computing the GRR is fast enough to run in real time during flight, it accounts for ground obstacles and wind, and for each point in the GRR it outputs the path to reach it with minimal loss of altitude. A related problem is estimating the minimal altitude an aircraft needs to glide to a given airfield in the presence of obstacles. This information enables pilots to plan routes that always have an airport within gliding distance. We formalize this problem using an optimal control formulation based on the same aircraft dynamics model. The resulting equations are solved with a second algorithm that outputs the minimal re-entry altitude and the paths to reach the airfield from any position while avoiding obstacles. The algorithms we develop are based on the Ordered Upwind Method and the Fast Marching Method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present composite Bernstein polynomials as a direct collocation method for approximating optimal control problems. An analysis of the convergence properties of composite Bernstein polynomials is provided, and beneficial properties of composite Bernstein polynomials for the solution of optimal control problems are discussed. The efficacy of the proposed approximation method is demonstrated through a bang-bang example. Lastly, we apply this method to a motion planning problem, offering a practical solution that emphasizes the ability of this method to solve complex optimal control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring of hybrid systems attracts both scientific and practical attention. However, monitoring algorithms suffer from the methodological difficulty of only observing sampled discrete-time signals, while real behaviors are continuous-time signals. To mitigate this problem of sampling uncertainties, we introduce a model-bounded monitoring scheme, where we use prior knowledge about the target system to prune interpolation candidates. Technically, we express such prior knowledge by linear hybrid automata (LHAs) -- the LHAs are called bounding models. We introduce a novel notion of monitored language of LHAs, and we reduce the monitoring problem to the membership problem of the monitored language. We present two partial algorithms -- one is via reduction to reachability in LHAs and the other is a direct one using polyhedra -- and show that these methods, and thus the proposed model-bounded monitoring scheme, are efficient and practically relevant.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Methods for Designing Dynamic Output Feedback Controllers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes model-based and model-free policy gradient methods (PGMs) for designing dynamic output feedback controllers for discrete-time partially observable systems. To fulfill this objective, we first show that any dynamic output feedback controller design is equivalent to a state-feedback controller design for a newly introduced system whose internal state is a finite-length input-output history (IOH). Next, based on this equivalency, we propose a model-based PGM and show its global linear convergence by proving that the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality holds for a reachability-based lossless projection of the IOH dynamics. Moreover, we propose two model-free implementations of the PGM: the multi- and single-episodic PGM. The former is a Monte Carlo approximation of the model-based PGM, whereas the latter is a simplified version of the former for ease of use in real systems. A sample complexity analysis of both methods is also presented. Finally, the effectiveness of the model-based/model-free PGMs is investigated through a numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Practical one-shot data-driven design of fractional-order PID controller: Fictitious reference signal approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a one-shot data-driven tuning method for a fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) controller. The proposed method tunes the FOPID controller in the model-reference control formulation. A loss function is defined to evaluate the match between a given reference model and the closed-loop response while explicitly considering the closed-loop stability. A loss function value is based on the fictitious reference signal computed using the input/output data. Model matching is achieved via loss function minimization. The proposed method is simple and practical: it needs only one-shot input/output data of a plant (no plant model required), considers the bounded-input bounded-output stability of the closed-loop system from a bounded reference input to a bounded output, and automatically determines the appropriate parameter value via optimization. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach facilitates good control performance, and destabilization can be avoided even if perfect model matching is unachievable.</description>

      <title>Real-time optimization of thermoelectric coolers' performance based on energy and exergy analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New strategy is presented to optimize the performance of Thermoelectric (TE) coolers. This approach breaks optimizing TE coolers free from traditional methods of controlling temperature or engineering materials and the structural properties of the junctions. We introduced a dimensionless figure, {\gamma}, that shows the ratio of the unavailable cooling capacity to the available cooling capacity. This parameter relates the TE coolers' coefficient of performance (COP) to the COP of the reversible cycle (second law of thermodynamics efficiency) for a given electrical current. The theoretical description of the model is presented, and it is shown that controlling {\gamma} during the TE performance minimizes entropy generation and energy loss, which leads to the maximum pumped heat. We validated this model against a designed TE cooler. In this cooler, contrary to conventional TE coolers, where the temperature of the cold space is generally controlled at a specific temperature, and the performance of the cooler overlooked, the entropy generation and heat loss are engineered, and the electrical current is tuned to minimize {\gamma} by the controller so that the TE cooler works near to its optimum performance at any time.</description>

      <title>Age of Computing: A Metric of Computation Freshness in Communication and Computation Cooperative Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05007v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In communication and computation cooperative networks (3CNs), timely computation is crucial but not always guaranteed. There is a strong demand for a computational task to be completed within a given deadline. The time taken involves both processing time, communication time, and the impact of the deadline. However, a measure of such timeliness in 3CNs is lacking. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept, Age of Computing (AoC), to capture computation freshness in 3CNs. We analyze AoC in a line topology consisting of a source, a transmitter, a receiver, and a computational node. Tasks generated by the source are immediately available at the transmitter, where they enter a communication queue. These tasks then pass to the receiver and subsequently to a computation queue at the computational node for processing. Each task has a deadline, requiring completion within this timeframe. AoC is evaluated under two types of deadlines: (i) soft deadline, tasks can be fed back to the source if delayed beyond the deadline, but with additional latency; (ii) hard deadline, tasks delayed beyond the deadline are discarded. Under both deadlines, we derive the AoC formula and a general expression for the time-average AoC. For the first-come, first-serve discipline, we obtain a closed-form expression for the average AoC under the soft deadline and an approximation for the hard deadline. In addition to freshness, we define computation throughput, providing a general expression and an approximation. To explore the relationship between freshness and throughput, we construct an optimization problem and prove that the objective pair is a weakly Pareto-optimal point. Numerical results validate all the theoretical findings. Additionally, they reveal that under the hard deadline, the computation throughput serves as a reliable proxy for the average AoC.</description>

      <title>A Physical-Layer Orchestration Framework for Open System Models of Autonomous RISs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10858</link>

Abstract: To obviate the control of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and related overhead, recent works envisioned the concept of autonomous RISs: Intelligent devices capable of autonomously deciding their reflection states. This paradigm is enabled by hybrid RIS (HRIS), a hardware solution that integrates sensing and channel estimation (CHEST) capabilities, enabling autonomous operation. Autonomous RISs operate independently alongside other network entities, promoting open communication system models for RISs. However, this autonomy introduces a significant challenge: How to schedule the operation of the autonomous RIS over time and frequency to minimize its impact on the network? This paper introduces a physical layer (PHY) orchestration framework within a massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) network to address this challenge. Our framework highlights an engineering trade-off termed the "autonomous RIS trade-off," which examines the performance implications of autonomy. Through mathematical analysis and numerical results, we describe the HRIS feasibility region, illustrating the conditions under which autonomous RISs are viable when properly deployed.</description>

      <title>Implementing and Evaluating Security in O-RAN: Interfaces, Intelligence, and Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a networking paradigm that builds on top of cloud-based, multi-vendor, open and intelligent architectures to shape the next generation of cellular networks for 5G and beyond. While this new paradigm comes with many advantages in terms of observatibility and reconfigurability of the network, it inevitably expands the threat surface of cellular systems and can potentially expose its components to several cyber attacks, thus making securing O-RAN networks a necessity. In this paper, we explore the security aspects of O-RAN systems by focusing on the specifications and architectures proposed by the O-RAN Alliance. We address the problem of securing O-RAN systems with a holistic perspective, including considerations on the open interfaces used to interconnect the different O-RAN components, on the overall platform, and on the intelligence used to monitor and control the network. For each focus area we identify threats, discuss relevant solutions to address these issues, and demonstrate experimentally how such solutions can effectively defend O-RAN systems against selected cyber attacks. This article is the first work in approaching the security aspect of O-RAN holistically and with experimental evidence obtained on a state-of-the-art programmable O-RAN platform, thus providing unique guideline for researchers in the field.</description>

      <title>Shortest-path recovery from signature with an optimal control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10619v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the signature-to-path reconstruction problem from the control theoretic perspective. Namely, we design an optimal control problem whose solution leads to the minimal-length path that generates a given signature. In order to do that, we minimize a cost functional consisting of two competing terms, i.e., a weighted final-time cost combined with the $L^2$-norm squared of the controls. Moreover, we can show that, by taking the limit to infinity of the parameter that tunes the final-time cost, the problem $\Gamma$-converges to the problem of finding a sub-Riemannian geodesic connecting two signatures. Finally, we provide an alternative reformulation of the latter problem, which is particularly suitable for the numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Two-Player Zero-Sum Hybrid Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we formulate a two-player zero-sum game under dynamic constraints defined by hybrid dynamical equations. The game consists of a min-max problem involving a cost functional that depends on the actions and resulting solutions to the hybrid system, defined as functions of hybrid time and, hence, can flow or jump. A terminal set conviniently defined allows to recast both finite and infinite horizon problems. We present sufficient conditions given in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-like equations to guarantee to attain a solution to the game. It is shown that when the players select the optimal strategy, the value function can be evaluated without computing solutions to the hybrid system. Under additional conditions, we show that the optimal state-feedback laws render a set of interest asymptotically stable for the resulting hybrid closed-loop system. Applications of this problem, as presented here, include a disturbance rejection scenario for which the effect of the perturbation is upper bounded, and a security scenario in which we formulate an optimal control problem under the presence of a maximizing attack.</description>
