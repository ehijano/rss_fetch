      <title>Closed-form solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with arbitrary dispersion and potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is investigated, in which the chromatic dispersion and potential are specified by two arbitrary functions. The equation in question is a natural generalization of a wide class of related nonlinear partial differential equations that are often used in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity and plasma physics. To construct exact solutions, a combination of the method of functional constraints and methods of generalized separation of variables is used. Exact closed-form solutions of the general nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions, are found. One-dimensional non-symmetry reductions are described, which lead the considered nonlinear partial differential equation to a simpler ordinary differential equation or a system of such equations. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for integrating nonlinear equations of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Rational Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ruijsenaars-Schneider models are integrable dynamical realizations of the Poincare group in 1+1 dimensions, which reduce to the Calogero and Sutherland systems in the nonrelativistic limit. In this work, a possibility to construct a one-parameter deformation of the Ruijsenaars-Schneider models by uplifting the Poincare algebra in 1+1 dimensions to the anti de Sitter algebra is studied. It is shown that amendments including a cosmological constant are feasible for the rational variant, while the hyperbolic and trigonometric systems are ruled out by our analysis. The issue of integrability of the deformed rational model is discussed in some detail. A complete proof of integrability remains a challenge.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of isomonodromic deformations on the torus and the elliptic Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider isomonodromic deformations of connections with a simple pole on the torus, motivated by the elliptic version of the sixth Painlev\'e equation. We establish an extended symmetry, complementing known results. The Calogero-Moser system in its elliptic version is shown to fit nicely in the geometric framework, the extended symplectic two-form is introduced and shown to be closed.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have wide range of applications, among them the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down conversion. Many of such models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras, thus, in this sense, they are exactly solvable. Whereas the advanced group-theoretic methods have been developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum of exactly solvable Hamiltonians, in quantum optics the prime interest is not the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but the evolution of an initial state, such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating in a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method of derivation of the solution to such a state evolution problem, applicable to a wide class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the $k$-photon down conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is given in the form of an infinite series expansion in the powers of propagation time with the coefficients defined by a recursion relation with a single polynomial function, unique for each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution to the parametric down conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

      <title>Integrability of polynomial vector fields and a dual problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of polynomial vector fields through the lens of duality in parameter spaces. We examine formal power series solutions annihilated by differential operators and explore the properties of the integrability variety in relation to the invariants of the associated Lie group. Our study extends to differential operators on affine algebraic varieties, highlighting the intrinsic connection between these operators and local analytic first integrals. To illustrate the duality the case of quadratic vector fields is considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Exact semiclassical dynamics of generic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is paradigmatic to study quantum phase transition in equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems and entanglement dynamics for a variety of disciplines. In thermodynamics limit, quantum fluctuations are negligible, its semiclassical dynamics in presence of only one nonlinear couplings, as a good benchmark to study quantum fluctuation in finite-size system, can be well obtained in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. In this work, we extend this semiclassical analysis into the regime where both nonlinear interactions are present, and successfully obtain its exact solutions of semiclassical equations by constructing an auxiliary function that is a linear combination of the $y$ and $z$ component of the classical spin in thermodynamic limit. Taking implementation of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in a Bose-Einstein condensate setup as an example, we figure out all classical dynamical modes, specially find out mesoscopic self-trapping mode in population and phase-difference space even persists in presence of both nonlinear couplings. Our results would be useful to analyze dynamical phase transitions and entanglement dynamics of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model in presence of both nonlinear couplings.</description>

      <title>Exact Hidden Markovian Dynamics in Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing nonequilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems is a challenging frontier of physics. In this Letter, we systematically construct solvable nonintegrable quantum circuits that exhibit exact hidden Markovian subsystem dynamics. This feature thus enables accurately calculating local observables for arbitrary evolution time. Utilizing the influence matrix method, we show that the influence of the time-evolved global system on a finite subsystem can be analytically described by sequential, time-local quantum channels acting on the subsystem with an ancilla of finite Hilbert space dimension. The realization of exact hidden Markovian property is facilitated by a solvable condition on the underlying two-site gates in the quantum circuit. We further present several concrete examples with varying local Hilbert space dimensions to demonstrate our approach.</description>
