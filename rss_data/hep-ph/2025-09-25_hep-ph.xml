      <title>The optical analogy between a Lorentz-violating cosmos and a Magneto-Electric medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of our study is to investigate the effects of Lorentz symmetry violation by examining the behavior of photons within the framework of the Standard Model Extension (SME). We show that, from an optical point of view, the Lorentz-violating cosmos is analogous to a Magneto-Electric medium like the quantum vacuum in the presence of the magnetic and electric field. This analogy provides a formulation for exploring experimental evidence of Lorentz symmetry violation in the propagation of light in a vacuum, in particular in the case of a radiation background observed like the CMB.</description>

      <title>X-rays from Inelastic Dark Matter Freeze-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study inelastic dark matter produced via freeze-in through a light mediator with a mass splitting below the electron-positron threshold. In this regime, the heavier dark matter state is naturally long-lived compared to the age of the Universe and decays to the lighter state in association with photons. Given a light mediator, the dark matter abundance is directly related to the decay rate of the heavier dark matter. We show that observations of photons from the galactic center can effectively probe inelastic dark matter freeze-in with mediators at the $100~\rm MeV$ scale and dark matter at the $\rm GeV$ scale.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on Pre-Equilibrium Jet Quenching and Predictions for Oxygen Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contrast between the as-yet unmeasurable energy-loss effects in proton-nucleus collisions and the striking magnitude of the so-called high-momentum flow coefficients challenges our understanding of jet quenching mechanisms in large nucleus-nucleus collisions when applied to smaller systems. Intermediate-sized, light ion collisions will offer key insight into the system-size dependence of the interplay between jet energy loss and jet flow effects. To make quantitative predictions, we extend a semi-analytic jet quenching framework by coupling it to state-of-the-art event-by-event hydrodynamics and, for the first time, incorporate pre-equilibrium energy loss via the hydrodynamic attractor. A Bayesian analysis shows that an early-time onset of energy loss is compatible with RHIC and LHC measurements of jet suppression and jet elliptic flow in large systems, as well as hadron suppression, with the exception of hadron elliptic flow. Using these constraints, we predict both hadron and jet quenching observables in oxygen-oxygen collisions, finding sizable energy loss that exceeds the no-quenching baseline.</description>

      <title>The Pareto Frontier of Resilient Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifying hadronic jets using their constituents' kinematic information is a critical task in modern high-energy collider physics. Often, classifiers are designed by targeting the best performance using metrics such as accuracy, AUC, or rejection rates. However, the use of a single metric can lead to the use of architectures that are more model-dependent than competitive alternatives, leading to potential uncertainty and bias in analysis. We explore such trade-offs and demonstrate the consequences of using networks with high performance metrics but low resilience.</description>

      <title>Study of Form Factors and Observables in $B_c^- \rightarrow \bar{D}^{(*)0}\ell^-\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and $B_c^- \rightarrow D^{(*)-}\ell^+\ell^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decays $B_c^- \rightarrow \bar{D}^{(*)0}\ell^-\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and $B_c^- \rightarrow D^{(*)-}\ell^+\ell^-$ within the Standard Model (SM), employing perturbative QCD form factors that are sensitive to the wave functions of $B_c$ and $D^{(*)}$ mesons. Using lattice QCD inputs for $B \to D^{(*)}$ and $B_c \to D$ transitions, we extract the shape parameters of the meson wave functions and estimate the $q^2$-dependence of $B_c \to D^*$ form factors via heavy quark spin symmetry. We present predictions for branching ratios, lepton flavor violating observables, and perform a detailed angular analysis of the cascade decay $B_{c}^{-} \to D^{*-}(\to D^{-}\pi^{0}) \ell^+\ell^-$, providing SM expectations for several angular observables.</description>

      <title>Connecting cosmologically decaying dark matter to neutrino physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter decays into invisible particles can leave an imprint in large-scale structure surveys due to a characteristic redshift-dependent suppression of the power spectrum. We present a model with two quasi-degenerate singlet fermions, $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, in which the heavier state decays as $\chi_2 \to \bar \chi_1 \nu \nu$ on cosmological time-scales, and that also accommodates non-zero neutrino masses. Remarkably, for parameters that yield the correct dark matter abundance via freeze-in and reproduce the observed neutrino masses, dark matter decay can produce detectable signals in forthcoming large-scale structure surveys, a diffuse anti-neutrino flux accessible to JUNO, and a gamma-ray line within the energy range probed by COSI. Both the cosmological lifetime of $\chi_2$ as well as the small (radiatively induced) mass splitting among $\chi_{1,2}$ are a natural consequence of the mechanism of neutrino mass generation within this model. This highlights the potential role of large-scale structure surveys in probing some classes of neutrino mass models.</description>

      <title>Lepton-flavor violation and two loop electroweak corrections to $(g-2)_\mu$ in the triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model (SM), charged lepton flavor-violating (LFV) processes are strictly forbidden, and thus observation of LFV would signal the presence of new physics. Recently, the Muon $g{-}2$ collaboration at Fermilab reported their final result for the muon magnetic dipole moment (MDM), which is now consistent with the latest SM prediction at the $1\sigma$ level. This imposes a significant constraint on new-physics contributions to $(g{-}2)_\mu$.
  In this work, we study the LFV processes $\ell_j^- \to \ell_i^-\gamma$ and $\ell_j^- \to \ell_i^- \ell_i^- \ell_i^+$ within the framework of the triplet next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model (TNMSSM). We include two-loop contributions to the muon MDM and investigate the resulting constraints on the model parameter space. Our numerical analysis shows that, in the TNMSSM, doubly charged Higgs bosons and the couplings $Y_L$ and $Y_D$ associated with the Type-I+II seesaw mechanism play a crucial role in both LFV processes and the muon MDM. Moreover, two-loop electroweak corrections have a significant impact on the muon MDM in this framework.</description>

      <title>Charged pion decay in a laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decays $\pi^{+}\to l^{+}\nu_{l}$ in the presence of a background electromagnetic plane wave with circular polarization. We find that, in the presence of this background, the number of hadronic form factors required to describe the pion-to-vacuum amplitude increases from one to four. Three of these form factors are associated with the axial vector current and one with the vector piece, which is in general different from zero. We obtain analytical expressions for the corresponding contributions to the decay width, considering in particular some range of values of interest for the frequency and amplitude of the external wave. For laser frequencies $\omega$ of the order of the eV, it is seen that the main correction to the result obtained in absence of the external field is proportional to the vector form factor, carrying a suppression factor of order $\sim(\omega/m_{\pi})^{4/3}$. In addition, we show that our expressions can be connected with the Kroll-Watson formula, which provides the differential cross section for the scattering of a charged particle by some potential in the presence of a strong external electromagnetic wave. Our analytical results are also compatible with previous numerical calculations obtained in the limit of low amplitude laser fields, offering new insight on some characteristics of these results.</description>

      <title>Plasmon damping in a charged Bose-Einstein condensate model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the calculation of the imaginary part of
  the dispersion relations of the propagating modes
  in a model of a charged scalar Bose-Einstein (BE) condensate, as well
  as the contribution to the imaginary part of the longitudinal component
  of the photon polarization tensor and the dielectric constant.
  In that model, two modes correspond to the transverse photon polarizations,
  while the other two modes are combinations of the longitudinal photon and
  the massive scalar field, which we denote as the $(\pm)$ modes.
  The dispersion relations of the transverse modes have the usual form for
  transverse photons in a plasma, and we do not consider here any further.
  In a previous work we determined the real part of the dispersion relations
  of the $(\pm)$ modes, as well as the real part of the longitudinal
  component of of polarization tensor and dielectric constant,
  which have some unique features. In the appropriate limit, those results
  reproduce the results obtained for the dielectric constant
  and dispersion relation in non-relativistic models of
  the BE condensation of charged scalars. Here we determine, in the same model,
  their imaginary part. The results can be useful in physical contexts
  involving the electrodynamics of a charged scalar BE condensate, and can
  serve as benchmark results for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Probing Invisible Decay of $Z^\prime$ at Muon Collider with Topological Data Analysis and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the use of topological data analysis (TDA) combined with machine learning for discriminating standard model backgrounds from the invisible decay of the $Z^\prime$ boson associated with monophoton emission at a 3 TeV muon collider. Reconstructed events are mapped into a six-dimensional kinematic space and aggregated into bags of events, from which persistent homology is used to extract Betti number distributions. Within the Multiple Instance Learning paradigm, classifiers trained on these topological descriptors demonstrate significantly improved classification accuracy compared to the conventional ML approaches based on event-wise kinematic inputs. We also draw exclusion contours at 95\% CL in the $(m_{Z^\prime}, m_\chi)$ parameter space, highlighting the potential of topological features to extend the discovery reach of future collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological constraints on QCD transport with quantified theory uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present data-driven, state-of-the-art constraints on the temperature-dependent specific shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma from Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\,\mathrm{TeV}$. We perform global Bayesian calibration using the JETSCAPE multistage framework with two particlization ans\"atze, Grad 14-moment and first-order Chapman-Enskog, and quantify theoretical uncertainties via a centrality-dependent model discrepancy term. When theoretical uncertainties are neglected, the specific bulk viscosity and some model parameters inferred using the two ans\"atze exhibit clear tension. Once theoretical uncertainties are quantified, the Grad and Chapman-Enskog posteriors for all model parameters become almost statistically indistinguishable and yield reliable, uncertainty-aware constraints. Furthermore, the learned discrepancy identifies where each model falls short for specific observables and centrality classes, providing insight into model limitations.</description>

      <title>Study of hidden-charm, doubly-strange pentaquarks in $\Lambda_b\to J/\psi \Xi^- K^+$ and $\Xi_b\to J/\psi \Xi^- \pi^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hidden-charm pentaquark states with double strangeness, $P_{css}$, have been predicted within the framework of unitary coupled-channel dynamics. In this work, we theoretically investigate the potential to observe these states in the decays $\Lambda_b\to J/\psi \Xi^-K^+$ and $\Xi_b\to J/\psi\Xi^-\pi^+$. In this framework, these pentaquark configurations couple strongly to the $J/\psi\Xi$ channel, as well as to other vector-baryon channels with the $\bar c c s s n$ flavor structure, making these decay modes promising for their observation through the corresponding invariant-mass distributions. Our analysis begins with the identification of the dominant weak decay mechanisms, followed by hadronization into meson-baryon channels, connected through flavor symmetry. Final-state interactions are then incorporated to dynamically generate the full amplitude, accounting for the formation of the pentaquark states. We compare our results with recent LHCb measurements of the $J/\psi\Xi^-$ mass distribution and find that, given the predicted pentaquark width of about 10 MeV in this channel, the state is too narrow to be resolved with the current experimental resolution, but it would become visible with significantly improved mass precision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytic framework for jet quenching in dense QCD matter that unifies medium-induced branching with vacuum collinear evolution. Energy transported outside the jet region is governed by a non-linear rate equation that resums arbitrary-angle gluon splittings, each enhanced by the medium length $L$. We show that for asymptotically large energies the energy-loss distribution for a single hard parton exhibits an exponential (generalized Poisson) behavior that provides the initial condition for a non-linear, DGLAP-like evolution that resums collinear logarithms associated with early in-vacuum fragmentation and with the angular resolution of the medium. This framework allows a systematic resummation of parton branching contributions to jet energy loss.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Electroweak Baryogenesis with Spontaneous $CP$ Violation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU) are among the most compelling indications of physics beyond the Standard Model. We revisit the inelastic Higgs-portal complex singlet, a minimal framework in which a complex scalar splits into two nearly degenerate real states, with an off-diagonal Higgs-portal interaction that drives coannihilation to set the relic density, while the elastic DM-Higgs coupling can be tuned small enough to evade direct-detection limits. This setup naturally supports a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT) and can account for the long-standing Galactic Center gamma-ray excess (GCE) via present-day DM annihilation into Higgs pairs. In this work, we show that the same framework, extended by a $Z_2$-symmetric dimension-6 $CP$-violating top Yukawa operator, can also generate the BAU via the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) mechanism. The cosmological history involves a two-step electroweak phase transition: first, the singlet fields acquire nonzero vacuum expectation values (vevs); then a strongly first-order transition occurs in which the Higgs develops its nonzero vev while the singlet vevs vanish. During this second step, both fields remain nonzero only within the advancing bubble wall, generating wall-localized $CP$ violation that biases sphaleron transitions and enables EWBG. After the phase transition, $CP$ and $Z_2$ symmetries are restored: the lightest singlet state becomes a stable DM candidate, while the vanishing singlet vevs allow the model to naturally satisfy the stringent constraints on $CP$ violation. We delineate the SFOEWPT-favored parameter space, identifying the criteria for the two-step phase transition region that simultaneously yields the observed BAU and relic density, explains the GCE, and predicts gravitational wave spectra accessible to next-generation space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Belle II Constraints on the Non-Minimal Universal Extra Dimensional Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements by the Belle II Collaboration report a branching ratio for the decay $B^+\to K^+ \nu \bar{\nu}$ with a 3.5$\sigma$ significance and deviating by 2.7$\sigma$ from Standard Model expectation. In this article, we interpret this experimental result through the lens of a Non-minimal Universal Extra Dimensional model, where the mass profiles and interactions among various Kaluza-Klein states differ remarkably from those in the minimal scenario. Our analysis indicates that, according to the model's parameters, the lower limit on the inverse of the compactification radius has been elevated to approximately 900 GeV. Conversely, the same analysis in the minimal version of the model does not allow for the establishment of a lower limit on the inverse of the compactification radius.</description>

      <title>Studies on Response Uniformity of RPC and Exploring Oscillation Dip and Valley, Non-Standard Interactions, and Earth's Core using Atmospheric Neutrinos at ICAL-INO detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, experimental and physics simulation studies are performed in the context of the proposed 50 kt Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). ICAL would detect atmospheric muon neutrinos and antineutrinos separately in the multi-GeV range of energies over a wide range of baselines. In the experimental part of the thesis, the effect of the non-uniformity of the graphite layer on the detector response of the resistive plate chamber is studied. In the physics simulation part, it is demonstrated for the first time that the neutrino oscillation dip and valley can be observed at ICAL using the up/down ratio of reconstructed muons and antimuons separately. A method is formulated such that the location of the dip and the alignment of the valley can be used to measure an atmospheric oscillation parameter called the mass-squared difference. Further, a new approach is proposed to probe the neutral-current non-standard interactions (NSIs) using the oscillation dip and valley. The opposite shifts in the oscillation dips and the contrast in the curvatures of oscillation valleys for reconstructed muons and antimuons are used to constrain the NSI parameter in two separate ways. While passing through the Earth, the upward-going atmospheric neutrinos experience the matter effects, which modify the neutrino oscillation patterns. These matter effects depend upon the density of electrons inside Earth and can be used to perform the neutrino oscillation tomography of Earth, complementary to gravitational measurements and seismic studies. This work demonstrates that the presence of Earth's core can be validated using the atmospheric neutrinos at ICAL.</description>

Abstract: In a series of $\sim 30$ papers starting in 1991, it has been claimed that the Higgs field should be heavier than its now-measured value. To reconcile this idea with reality, it was modified to the assertion that the Higgs field describes two physical degrees of freedom, one of which corresponds to a second Higgs particle with mass 690 GeV. Here I summarize the lack of theoretical and experimental evidence for these claims.</description>

      <title>Configuration and Benchmarking of $\mathrm{e}^+\mathrm{e}^-$ Processes with K4GeneratorsConfig</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of electron-positron colliders will require unprecedented precision in both theory and experiment. Sophisticated software frameworks are essential to evaluate detector concepts, optimize designs, and simulating physical processes. In this context, Monte Carlo (MC) event generators play a central role, enabling realistic simulations of Standard Model processes and providing the basis for physics studies. However, technical consistency across different generators remains critical, particularly in domains where agreement is expected. To address this need, we present K4GeneratorsConfig, a Python-based package that automates the benchmarking process for MC generators. The tool translates universal physics inputs into generator-specific configurations, ensuring consistency, reproducibility, and reduced human error. Its modular design allows for straightforward integration of additional generators, supports batch processing, and provides compatibility with the Key4hep software stack</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from high-temperature vacuum decay in scale-invariant models: nanohertz vs. millihertz regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of high-temperature vacuum decay and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background within the framework of general scale-invariant models. The effective potential is constructed to include tree-level contributions, the Coleman-Weinberg correction, finite-temperature effects, and the Daisy resummation technique, culminating in a high-temperature form. We investigate the dynamics of the first-order phase transition, calculating the critical and nucleation temperatures, the supercooling parameter, and the key transition parameters $\alpha$ (transition strength) and $\beta$ (inverse duration). The vacuum decay is found to be dominated by sphaleron transitions rather than quantum tunneling. We compute the full GW spectrum arising from bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. An extensive numerical scan reveals two distinct phenomenological regimes: one produces nanohertz-frequency GW signals potentially detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA), while the other yields millihertz-frequency signals that are prime targets for future space-based interferometers like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).</description>

      <title>Effect of Cosmic Neutrino Background on the Dark Matter Self-interaction via Neutrino force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino-pair exchange induces a neutrino force that can drive dark matter (DM) self-interactions and impact small-scale structure formation. In the presence of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), this force can be modified, with important consequences for DM phenomenology. We study the effect of the C$\nu$B on neutrino forces, generated by the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions. We explore the significance of the background neutrino force on the scalar DM-neutrino portal model, including DM self-scattering and annihilation. Our results show that the interplay between attractive vacuum potential and repulsive background potential leads to a screening effect that varies across DM mass ($m_\chi$) regimes, strongly affecting DM self-scattering in the DM mass $m_\nu \lesssim m_\chi \lesssim T_{C \nu B}$. By contrast, the impact on DM annihilation is negligible. Overall, the C$\nu$B substantially reshapes the viable coupling range for DM self-interactions while remaining compatible with current constraints, offering a pathway to small-scale structure problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical evaluation of parton distribution Mellin moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed comprehension of momentum fraction and energy dependence of proton structure functions is among the major difficulties in high-energy physics. Perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plays as an extensive foundation for analysing deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and experiments with hadron-hadron collisions. In such a framework, where the hard collisions advance through the partonic components of hadrons, a pivotal contribution is imparted by parton distribution functions (PDFs). PDFs provide information about the nucleonic substructure in terms of its components. PDFs have become more and more convictive following the advent of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Moments of PDFs are important quantities for the analysis of hadronic internal structure. The Mellin moments of such parton densities have been discussed and their analyses have been carried out numerically.</description>

      <title>Tensor Spin Polarization Induced by Curved Freeze-Out Hypersurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the curvature of the freeze-out hypersurface polarizes massive vector bosons in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Starting from the Proca Lagrangian and using the Wigner function formalism, we perform a systematic gradient expansion to obtain a covariant spin-polarization tensor expressed in terms of hydrodynamic fields and the curvature tensor of the freeze-out hypersurface. Analytic results for Bjorken and Gubser flows show that curvature anisotropy generates a non-zero tensor polarization. For $\phi$ meson, we estimate the curvature contribution to its spin alignment as $ \delta \Theta_{yy} \sim -10^{-4} $ to $ -10^{-3} $. We also find that the curvature contribution grows as the system size decreases, suggesting that spin polarization measurements in small systems may provide a clean probe of this geometric effect.</description>

      <title>Collinear Structure of Nonlinear Small-$x$ Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to high-energy QCD factorization of cross-sections for processes involving a dilute projectile and a dense target. Our method preserves the factorization between "fast" and "slow" modes in the longitudinal momentum $k^+$ for a projectile moving along the positive light-cone direction, making it compatible with higher-order loop computations done within the standard formulation of the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effective field theory. Moreover, it eliminates the anomalous double collinear logarithms that typically hinder the convergence of perturbation theory at small-$x$. Our scheme amounts to a change of basis in the space of CGC operators, introducing an arbitrary transverse scale dependence while leaving physical cross-sections invariant. Implementing this scheme requires a modification of the high-energy renormalization group equation for the CGC operators, which we explicitly derive at next-to-leading order (NLO) and in the non-linear regime for the case of the dipole operator and the DIS impact factor. This general framework provides a consistent and systematic prescription for computing observables in the small-$x$ regime of QCD, free from collinear instabilities.</description>

      <title>Studies of beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron production in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV within a transport model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy proton proton ($pp$) collisions at the LHC, non-prompt charm hadrons, originating from beauty hadron decays, provide a valuable probe for beauty quark dynamics, particularly at low transverse momentum where direct beauty measurements are challenging. We employ A Multi-Phase Transport Model (AMPT) of string melting version coupled with PYTHIA8 initial conditions to study the beauty hadron and non-prompt charm hadron productions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. In this work, the beauty quark mass during the generation stage has been increased to reproduce the measured $b\bar{b}$ cross section, and a beauty flavor specific coalescence parameter $r_{BM}^b$ is introduced to match LHCb measurements of beauty baryon to meson ratios. With these refinements, AMPT achieves a reasonable agreement with experimental data on beauty hadron yields and non-prompt charm hadron production from ALICE and LHCb. We present the transverse momentum and multiplicity dependence of non-prompt to prompt charm hadron ratios, providing new insights into the interplay between beauty quark production and hadronization process. We emphasize that the multiplicity dependence of the non-prompt to prompt charm hadron productions can be useful to constrain the flavor dependences of the coalescence dynamics. This work establishes a unified framework for future studies of heavy quark transport and collective flow behavior in small collision systems.</description>

      <title>Probing Beyond the Standard Model Scenarios in Long-baseline and Astrophysical Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, outstanding progress in the neutrino experiment frontier has greatly advanced our understanding of the flavor oscillations of active neutrinos. The remaining key questions such as the neutrino mass ordering, the presence of CP violation in the lepton sector, and the octant of $\theta_{23}$ are expected to be resolved in the coming years. The current precise knowledge of neutrino mass and mixing parameters, together with the promising prospects of next-generation neutrino experiments, provides a unique opportunity to test scenarios beyond the Standard Model (BSM) through neutrino oscillation phenomena. This thesis investigates several such BSM scenarios and examines the capability of the next-generation neutrino experiments to probe them.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Rush Hour: Rapid Formation of Bright, Massive, Disky, Star-Forming Galaxies as Signatures of Early-Universe Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early JWST observations have revealed a high-redshift universe more vibrant than predicted by canonical galaxy-formation models within $\Lambda$CDM, showing an excess of ultraviolet(UV)-bright, massive, and morphologically mature galaxies. Departures from $\Lambda$CDM prior to recombination can imprint signatures on non-linear structure formation at high redshift. In this paper, we investigate one such scenario - Early Dark Energy, originally proposed to resolve the Hubble tension - and its implications for these high-redshift challenges. We present the first large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of these models. Modifications to the pre-recombination expansion history accelerate early structure formation and produce UV luminosity and stellar mass functions in excellent agreement with JWST measurements, requiring essentially no additional calibrations. Predictions converge to $\Lambda$CDM at lower redshifts ($z \lesssim 3$), thereby preserving all successes of $\Lambda$CDM. This model also accelerates the emergence of stellar and gaseous disks, increasing their number densities by $\sim 0.5$ dex at $z\simeq 6$-7, primarily due to the higher abundance of massive galaxies. Taken together, these results demonstrate how early-universe physics can simultaneously reconcile multiple high-redshift challenges and the Hubble tension while retaining the core achievements of $\Lambda$CDM. This opens a pathway to constraining a broad class of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models with forthcoming observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Hyperbolic Encounters of Primordial Black Holes in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by primordial black holes (PBHs) in the dense cores of dwarf galaxies (DGs), considering both hierarchical binary black hole (BBH) mergers and close hyperbolic encounters (CHEs). Extending our previous merger framework, we incorporate up to four successive generations of PBHs within a Hubble time and quantify the GW emission from both channels. Our results show that while BBHs dominate the total emission, CHEs occur earlier, provide the first GW signals, and contribute a continuous though subdominant background that becomes relatively more significant once the initial PBH population is depleted and binary formation is suppressed. We compute the resulting SGWB spectra, demonstrating that BBHs and CHEs imprint distinct frequency dependencies consistent with analytical expectations. We then compare the predicted signals with the sensitivity of observatories such as LISA, DECIGO, ET, IPTA, and SKA. The numerical implementation is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/TadeoDGAguilar/PBHs_and_GWs_into_DG}.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic momentum distributions due to radiation recoil in relativistic plasmas with electric and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of strong electromagnetic fields with plasma generates radiation accompanied by a recoil force, which can significantly alter the plasma dynamics. In this work, we investigate the development of anisotropic momentum distributions induced by the combined action of electric and magnetic fields on a thermally relativistic plasma. We consider three distinct types of anisotropy. The first arises from a pure magnetic field acting on plasma with either isotropic or anisotropic initial momentum distributions, producing the characteristic ring-shaped momentum profile. The second is driven by a pure electric field, where radiation reaction generates a partial, anisotropic ring distribution in momentum space: significant modifications occur primarily in the 90$^\circ$--180$^\circ$ and 270$^\circ$--360$^\circ$ sectors of the $p_x$--$p_y$ plane, while the remaining quadrants remain largely unaffected. The third case considers the combined effect of electric and magnetic fields. When the cyclotron frequency is very close to the upper hybrid frequency, the azimuthal symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution is broken. Conversely, in the regime where the cyclotron frequency is lower than the upper hybrid frequency, the rapid oscillations of the electric field dominate and preserve the symmetry of the ring-momentum distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between computation and scattering both operationally (hence phenomenologically) and formally. We show how topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs) enable universal quantum computation, using the Reshetikhin-Turaev and Turaev-Viro models to show how TQNNs implement quantum error-correcting codes. We then exhibit a formal correspondences between TQNNs and amplituhedra to support the existence of amplituhedra for generic quantum processes. This construction shows how amplituhedra are geometric representations of underlying topological structures. We conclude by pointing to applications areas enabled by these results.</description>

      <title>First Data of the 3000 km$^2$ Radio Detector at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present the status and first data from the Radio Detector (RD) at the Pierre Auger Observatory, consisting of $1660$ radio antennas deployed across the $3000$ km$^2$ surface detector array. These antennas measure the radio emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band, enabling electromagnetic energy measurements for air showers with zenith angles above $65\deg$. Combined with the muonic measurements from the water-Cherenkov detectors (WCDs), this allows mass composition studies at the highest energies. The large-scale deployment of the RD began in November 2023 and was completed in November 2024. A full end-to-end calibration shows consistency between Galactic and in-lab calibration to better than $5$\% and includes continuous monitoring for hardware failures, ensuring, for example, antenna alignment within $5\deg$. We present the first data, demonstrating a strong correlation between the electromagnetic energy measured by the RD and the total shower energy measured by the WCD, confirming that the detector chain - including triggering, data readout, absolute calibration, and reconstruction is well understood. We highlight a particularly impressive $32$ EeV shower at a zenith angle of $85\deg$, producing a $50$ km-long radio footprint, showcasing the unique capabilities of this detector.</description>

      <title>Directly Probing Neutrino Interactions through CMB Phase Shift Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbations in the cosmic neutrino background produce a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic oscillations imprinted in the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), providing a unique observational probe of neutrino physics. In this work, we explore how this phase shift signature is altered in the presence of neutrino interactions with temperature-dependent scattering rates, motivated by physical constructions for neutrino self-interactions and neutrino-dark matter couplings. A key finding is that the phase shift in these realistic models -- characterized by gradual rather than instantaneous decoupling -- maintains the same functional form as the free-streaming template, with only the asymptotic amplitude decreasing for stronger interactions that delay decoupling. This simple parametrization enables us to directly constrain neutrino interactions through phase shift measurements in the temperature and polarization power spectra from CMB observations. Analyzing the latest data from \textit{Planck}, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope, we derive strong constraints on the neutrino decoupling redshift. Our global analysis indicates that neutrinos have been freely streaming since deep within the radiation-dominated epoch. We also explore flavor-dependent scenarios in which only one neutrino species interacts. Overall, our work establishes a signature-driven framework that exploits the clean phase shift signal in the acoustic oscillations of the CMB as a precise and robust probe of non-standard neutrino interactions in the early universe.</description>

      <title>QCD factorization for the $B\to \gamma\ell\nu_{\ell}$ decay beyond leading power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative leptonic $B\to \gamma\ell\nu_{\ell}$ decay serves as an ideal platform to determine the $B$-meson inverse moment which is a fundamental nonperturbative parameter for the $B$ meson. In this paper, we explore precise QCD contributions to this decay with an energetic photon. We reproduce the next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic resummation formula for the decay amplitude at leading power in $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}/m_b$. Employing operator identities, we calculate subleading-power contributions from the expansion of the hard-collinear propagator of the internal up quark and the heavy-quark expansion of the bottom quark. We update the contributions from the hadronic structure of the photon to the $\decay$ process with the dispersion technique. Together with other yet known power corrections, phenomenological applications including the partial branching fraction and ratio of the branching fractions of the radiative $B$ decay are investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02867v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FAIR Universe HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge focused on measuring the physical properties of elementary particles with imperfect simulators. Participants were required to compute and report confidence intervals for a parameter of interest regarding the Higgs boson while accounting for various systematic (epistemic) uncertainties. The dataset is a tabular dataset of 28 features and 280 million instances. Each instance represents a simulated proton-proton collision as observed at CERN's Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland. The features of these simulations were chosen to capture key characteristics of different types of particles. These include primary attributes, such as the energy and three-dimensional momentum of the particles, as well as derived attributes, which are calculated from the primary ones using domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, a label feature designates each instance's type of proton-proton collision, distinguishing the Higgs boson events of interest from three background sources. As outlined in this paper, the permanent release of the dataset allows long-term benchmarking of new techniques. The leading submissions, including Contrastive Normalising Flows and Density Ratios estimation through classification, are described. Our challenge has brought together the physics and machine learning communities to advance our understanding and methodologies in handling systematic uncertainties within AI techniques.</description>

      <title>$q_T$-slicing with multiple jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern collider phenomenology requires unprecedented precision for the theoretical predictions, for which slicing techniques provide an essential tool at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling. The most popular slicing variable is based on the transverse momentum $q_T$ of a color-singlet final state, but its generalization to final states with jets is known to be very difficult. Here we propose two generalizations of $q_T$ that can be used for jet processes, providing proof of concept with an NLO slicing for $pp \to 2$ jets. We present factorization formulae that enable our approach to NNLO, calculate the NNLO collinear-soft function and demonstrate slicing at this order for $e^+e^- \to 2$ jets. One of these generalizations of $q_T$ only applies to planar Born processes, such as $pp \to 2$ jets, but offers a dramatic simplification of the soft function. We also discuss how our approach can directly be extended to obtain predictions for the fragmentation of hadrons. This presents a promising path for high-precision QCD calculations with multi-jet final states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum field theories at non-zero temperature still holds fundamental open questions, in particular what happens to vacuum Goldstone bosons when the temperature is increased. By investigating a complex scalar field theory on the lattice we demonstrate that Goldstone bosons at non-zero temperature behave like screened massless particle-like excitations, so-called thermoparticles, which continue to exist even in the symmetry-restored phase of the theory. We provide non-perturbative evidence for the functional form of the Goldstone mode's dissipative behaviour, and determine its corresponding spectral properties. Since the persistence of thermal Goldstone modes within symmetry-restored phases is predicted to be a model-independent characteristic, this has fundamental consequences for systems in which continuous symmetries are restored at high temperatures.</description>

      <title>Doubly charmed hexaquarks in the diquark picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06107v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate doubly charmed hexaquark states within the diquark picture, by employing the constituent quark model and the quark-interchange model as our theoretical frameworks. Using the Gaussian expansion method, we systematically study these states, with calculating various properties such as mass spectra, internal contributions of each Hamiltonian component, root-mean-square radii, and two-body strong decay widths. Our analysis of the mass spectra reveals no stable state in this system. Furthermore, the root-mean-square radii suggest that the doubly charmed hexaquark states exhibit a compact configuration. By examining the decay widths, we identify potentially detectable states and their primary decay channels within each subsystem. Despite the large decay phase space, we still find narrow states with total widths of less than 10 MeV. This study provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the structures and interactions of doubly charmed hexaquark states and offers valuable insights for future experimental searches.</description>

      <title>COSINUS model-independent sensitivity to the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter signal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: COSINUS is a dark matter direct detection experiment using NaI crystals as cryogenic scintillating calorimeters. If no signal is observed, this will constrain the dark matter scattering rate in sodium iodide. We investigate how this constraint can be used to infer that the annual modulation signal observed in the DAMA/LIBRA experiment cannot originate from dark matter nuclear recoil events, independently of the dark matter model. We achieve this by unfolding the DAMA modulation spectrum to obtain the implied unquenched nuclear recoil spectrum, which we then compare to the expected COSINUS sensitivity. We find that assuming zero background in the signal region, a 1$\sigma$, 2$\sigma$ or 3$\sigma$ confidence limit exclusion can be obtained with 57, 130 or 250 kg day of exposure, respectively. A simple background model indicates that in the presence of background, the exposure requirements may increase by $\sim30\%$.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory: An innovative framework for eliminating renormalization ambiguities in QCD and QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), an innovative framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion through Effective Dynamical Renormalization (EDR) with Principle of Observable Effective Matching (POEM) constraints. This approach yields completely scale and scheme invariant observables whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to the experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD and QED, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with scheme-independent equations, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$ through EDR implementation. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05262 \pm 0.0005$, which is in excellent agreement with the experimental results ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring calculation that are orders of magnitude lower than those of conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approaches. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76)$), differing from the experiment by only $-1.2(81) \times 10^{-13}$ representing an excellent 0.15$\sigma$ agreement. The framework enables the self-consistent extraction of the natural electromagnetic coupling $\alpha_{\text{eff}}^{-1}(m_e) = 137.036005301$ at the electron mass scale.</description>

      <title>Frequentist Uncertainties on Neural Density Ratios with wifi Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce wifi ensembles as a novel framework to obtain asymptotic frequentist uncertainties on density ratios, with a particular focus on neural ratio estimation in the context of high-energy physics. When the density ratio of interest is a likelihood ratio conditioned on parameters, wifi ensembles can be used to perform simulation-based inference on those parameters. After training the basis functions f_i(x), uncertainties on the weights w_i can be straightforwardly propagated to the estimated parameters without requiring extraneous bootstraps. To demonstrate this approach, we present an application in quantum chromodynamics at the Large Hadron Collider, using wifi ensembles to estimate the likelihood ratio between generated quark and gluon jets. We use this learned likelihood ratio to estimate the quark fraction in a synthetic mixed quark/gluon sample, showing that the resultant uncertainties empirically satisfy the desired coverage properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nelson-Barr theories solve the strong CP problem with CP spontaneously broken at \Lambda_{CP} and transmitted to the CP conserving version of the SM through vector-like quarks (VLQs). For an arbitrary number of CP breaking scalars and VLQs, we perform the full one-loop matching calculations at \Lambda_{CP} up to dimension five operators and the relevant matching calculations at the VLQ scale relevant to tracking the contributions to the parameter \bar{\theta}. In the EFT after the CP breaking scalars have been integrated out, we confirm that the running of \bar{\theta} at one-loop is induced by CP violating dimension five operators and similarly by dimension six operator after matching to the SMEFT. In the latter, an additional contribution enters in the matching to \bar{\theta} at tree-level due to a dimension five operator. Analyzing the experimental constraint from \bar{\theta} for generic settings, we see that a large separation between \Lambda_{CP} and the VLQ scale already suppresses the one-loop contribution to \bar{\theta} sufficiently. We confirm that a simple extension based on a nonconventional CP has a vanishing one-loop contribution to \bar{\theta}. Part of our results can be also applied to generic VLQ extensions of the SM.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network Approach to Quark-Antiquark Color Flux Tube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework for modelling the spatial distribution of chromodynamic fields induced by quark-antiquark pairs, based on lattice Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to conventional neural networks, PINNs incorporate physical laws-expressed here as differential equations governing type-II superconductivity-directly into the training objective. By embedding these equations into the loss function, we guide the network to learn physically consistent solutions. Adopting an inverse problem approach, we extract the parameters of the superconducting equations from lattice QCD data and subsequently solve them. To accommodate physical boundary conditions, we recast the system into an integro-differential form and extend the analysis within the fractional PINNs framework. The accuracy of the reconstructed field distribution is assessed via relative $L_2$-error norms. We further extract physical observables such as the string tension and the mean width of the flux tube, offering quantitative insight into the confinement mechanism. This method enables the reconstruction of colour field profiles as functions of quark-antiquark separation without recourse to predefined parametric models. Our results illuminate aspects of the dual Meissner effect and highlight the promise of data-driven strategies in addressing non-perturbative challenges in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Strong CP Phase and Parity in the Hamiltonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18620v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show using the Hamiltonian formalism that if parity is a good symmetry of QCD, then the strong CP phase $\bar{\theta}$ must be $0$ or $\pi$. We find that for $P$ to be a physical symmetry, it must leave the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ associated with the $\theta$-vacuum invariant ($P: \mathcal{H}_\theta \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_\theta$), which is possible only for $\theta = 0$ or $\pi$. We also show that forming linear combinations of states from different $\theta$-sectors produces only classical statistical mixtures, consistent with superselection rules, confirming that $\mathcal{H}_\theta$ is the most general Hilbert space for the quantum theory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that requiring $[P,\Omega]=0$, where $\Omega$ is the generator of large gauge transformations, independently enforces $\bar{\theta}=0$ (mod $\pi$), and that for complex quark mass matrix $M$, if a generalized parity operator $\mathcal{P}$ is a symmetry, then the value of $\theta$ gets determined so that it exactly cancels $Arg Det M$, again giving $\bar{\theta}=0$ (mod $\pi$). These results establish the equivalence of the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian approaches to the strong CP problem.</description>

      <title>A New Source of Phase Transition Gravitational Waves: Heavy Particle Braking Across Bubble Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the new heavy dark matter production mechanism from cosmic phase transition, we propose a novel mechanism for the generation of microscopic gravitational waves (GWs) during cosmological first-order phase transitions arising from the braking of heavy particles as they traverse bubble walls. Unlike the well-known sources such as bubble collisions, sound waves, or turbulence in the plasma, this mechanism originates from the direct interaction between massive particles and the expanding bubble wall. We use quantum field theory to rigorously compute the gravitational radiation. The resulting GW spectrum exhibits distinctive features: The peak frequency is tightly correlated with the bubble wall velocity, while the peak amplitude scales as the fourth power of the heavy particle mass. These unique dependencies offer a new observational handle on particle physics beyond the Standard Model. We illustrate this mechanism within a specific model framework and demonstrate its viability. Our findings enrich the landscape of phase transition GW sources and open new avenues for more directly probing heavy particle dynamics and new physics models in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Surveying the theory space of pion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use a holographic model to survey the space of strongly coupled SU(Nc) gauge dynamics with QCD-like chiral symmetry breaking pattern for quarks in the fundamental representation. We systematically identify the light degrees of freedom (rho, sigma and pi mesons) that would make up the dark sector as a function of Nf, Nc and a common quark mass scale. We identify seven distinct effective theories that are of interest to explore and make a first summary of the expected dark matter phenomenology. Amongst our results we conclude that QCD-like models where the low energy theory is described purely in terms of pions struggle to generate a large enough Mpi/fpi value so these theories will need extra relic density generation mechanisms to be viable. The largest space of models (with an intermediate quark mass) have both the sigma and rho lying below 2 Mpi and are largely unexplored in the literature so far. Regions with just one of rho or sigma light are possible in constrained parameter regions. These states aid the pion relic density generation as needed for valid theories. The sigma always lies above the pi mass becoming degenerate with the pi in the extreme walking limit.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of photon polarization observables in Bethe-Heitler process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of polarization transfer from the initial electron to the bremsstrahlung photon in electron-nucleus scattering (Bethe-Heitler process) are considered. The calculation is carried out without the assumption of smallness of the electron mass. A detailed comparison with previous well-known works is made. Some issues related to neglecting the electron mass are shown and commented on. The results are applicable to the modelling of polarized cross sections at low energies (even at a few electron mass scale).</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the nature of $\phi(2170)$ state in the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the production of $\phi(2170)$ state in the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction with the effective Lagrangian approach. In addition to the tree level contributions from the $\phi(1680)$ meson and a possible X(1750) state, we consider also the $K_1$-$K$-$\bar{K}$ intermediate state process from the perspective of triangular singularity. Based on the one-photon exchange approximation, a pair of $K_1 \bar{K}$ mesons was firstly produced, and then the $K_1$ meson subsequently decays into $\phi$ and $K$, and the $K\bar{K}$ pair produce the $\pi^+ \pi^-$ through the final state interactions, in which the scalar meson $f_0(980)$ is dynamically generated. We show that the inclusion of the triangle loop diagrams leads to a good description of the new BESIII measurements, especially for the structure of $\phi(2170)$. This provides a novel interpretation of the $\phi(2170)$ state, offering new insights into its fundamental nature which is still unclear. Furthermore, it is found that these measurements on the $e^+e^- \to \phi \pi^+\pi^-$ reaction can be used to determine some of the properties of two $K_1$ mesons with masses around 1610 MeV and 1895 MeV, which are crucial to reproduce the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation model into the NEUT event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the implementation of a model for charged-current quasi-elastic (CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering in the NEUT Monte Carlo event generator. This model employs relativistic momentum distributions obtained from mean field theory and relativistic distorted waves to describe the initial and final nucleon states. Final state interactions, both elastic and inelastic, are modelled by combining distorted waves with the NEUT intranuclear cascade, offering a more accurate representation of the interactions experienced by scattered nucleons. The model and its implementation in NEUT are described in detail and benchmarked against $\nu_{\mu}$-$^{12}$C scattering cross-section measurements from T2K and MINER$\nu$A, as well as $\nu_{\mu}$-$^{40}$Ar measurements from MicroBooNE. Results, including transverse kinematic imbalance variables and scattered nucleon kinematics, show improved $\chi^2$ values compared to other CCQE models in NEUT. Furthermore, the model consistently predicts lower cross sections in CCQE-dominated regions, indicating potential for further refinement, such as incorporating two-body currents or the use of more advanced nucleon axial form factors consistent with lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Hybrid Particle Detectors to the Energy Spectra of Air Shower Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring the energy spectrum of air shower components crucial for understanding primary cosmic rays and the physical processes governing their interactions in the atmosphere. However, accurately measuring the energy of shower particles reaching the ground is challenging due to the inherent simplicity of typical cosmic ray experiments.
  This study takes advantage of a hybrid detector station and introduces an analysis for assessing the energy spectra of air shower components. The station is composed of a scintillator surface detector (SSD), a water-Cherenkov detector (WCD), and resistive plate chambers (RPCs). Our results demonstrate that the combination of data from these detectors enables precise assessment of the energy spectrum of electromagnetic particles and low-energy muons, independent of potential detector ageing effects.</description>

      <title>Quintessence and phantoms in light of DESI 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse DESI BAO, CMB, and supernova data to explore the physical origin of the DESI indication for dynamical dark energy. Beyond the standard CPL parametrization, we explore truncated alternatives and quintessence models. We conclude that there is compelling evidence for dark energy to be decaying in the late universe, but the evidence for a phantom behaviour is less significant. Models without phantom behaviour are compatible with the data at the $2\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we examine a concrete quintessence scenario with a Higgs-like potential, allowing for a direct comparison with parametrized approaches and testing its consistency with current observations. This framework enables a broader investigation of late-time cosmic evolution and reveals a $93.8\%$ preference for a future transition into an anti-de Sitter space, which may ultimately lead to a cosmological collapse of our Universe.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter. III. Covariant canonical quantum gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In earlier companion papers, we showed that non-singular primordial black holes (PBHs) could account for all the dark matter (DM) over a significantly wider mass range compared to Schwarzschild PBHs. Those studies, mostly based on phenomenological metrics, are now extended by considering the quantum-corrected space-time recently proposed by Zhang, Lewandowski, Ma and Yang (ZLMY), derived from an effective canonical (loop) quantum gravity approach explicitly enforcing general covariance. Unlike the BHs considered earlier, ZLMY BHs are free from Cauchy horizons, and are hotter than their Schwarzschild counterparts. We show that this higher temperature boosts the evaporation spectra of ZLMY PBHs, tightening limits on their abundance relative to Schwarzschild PBHs and shrinking the asteroid mass window where they can constitute all the DM, a result which reverses the earlier trend, but rests on firmer theoretical ground. While stressing the potential key role of quantum gravity effects in addressing the singularity and DM problems, our study shows that working within a consistent theoretical framework can strongly affect observational predictions.</description>

      <title>Parity violation in framework of nonmetricity gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest observational data of Planck satellite shows nontrivial value of polarization rotation angle caused by cosmic birefringence in the early universe. Moreover, the asymmetry of baryons versus anti-baryons still remains mysterious. Both of them indicates that there should be hidden new physics such as fundamental symmetry breaking. In this paper, we try to interpret these two events in framework of nonmetricity modified gravity. We introduce an interaction term between nonmetricity-based function and matter current, and calculate both the rotation angle and baryon-to-photon ratio. We also constrain the model parameters using the current observational data. With some specific examples, we demonstrate that in nonmetricity gravity theory, these two events can be interpreted in a unified way. Nevertheless, the minimal coupling of nonmetricity scalar and the matter current might not be favored.</description>
