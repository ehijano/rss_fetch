      <title>SAAP: Spatial awareness and Association based Prefetching of Virtual Objects in Augmented Reality at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) applications face performance challenges due to their high computational demands and need for low-latency responses. Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE).
  Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>FaultGPT: Industrial Fault Diagnosis Question Answering System by Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, employing single-modality large language models based on mechanical vibration signals as Tuning Predictors has introduced new perspectives in intelligent fault diagnosis. However, the potential of these methods to leverage multimodal data remains underexploited, particularly in complex mechanical systems where relying on a single data source often fails to capture comprehensive fault information. In this paper, we present FaultGPT, a novel model that generates fault diagnosis reports directly from raw vibration signals. By leveraging large vision-language models (LVLM) and text-based supervision, FaultGPT performs end-to-end fault diagnosis question answering (FDQA), distinguishing itself from traditional classification or regression approaches. Specifically, we construct a large-scale FDQA instruction dataset for instruction tuning of LVLM. This dataset includes vibration time-frequency image-text label pairs and human instruction-ground truth pairs. To enhance the capability in generating high-quality fault diagnosis reports, we design a multi-scale cross-modal image decoder to extract fine-grained fault semantics and conducted instruction tuning without introducing additional training parameters into the LVLM. Extensive experiments, including fault diagnosis report generation, few-shot and zero-shot evaluation across multiple datasets, validate the superior performance and adaptability of FaultGPT in diverse industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Programmers Aren't Obsolete Yet: A Syllabus for Teaching CS Students to Responsibly Use Large Language Models for Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating code generation, offering immense potential to enhance programmer productivity. However, their non-deterministic nature and reliance on user input necessitate a robust understanding of programming fundamentals to ensure their responsible and effective use. In this paper, we argue that foundational computing skills remain crucial in the age of LLMs. We propose a syllabus focused on equipping computer science students to responsibly embrace LLMs as performance enhancement tools. This work contributes to the discussion on the why, when, and how of integrating LLMs into computing education, aiming to better prepare programmers to leverage these tools without compromising foundational software development principles.</description>

      <title>Loop unrolling: formal definition and application to testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Testing processes usually aim at high coverage, but loops severely limit coverage ambitions since the number of iterations is generally not predictable. Most testing teams address this issue by adopting the extreme solution of limiting themselves to branch coverage, which only considers loop executions that iterate the body either once or not at all. This approach misses any bug that only arises after two or more iterations.
  To achieve more meaningful coverage, testing strategies may unroll loops, in the sense of using executions that iterate loops up to n times for some n greater than one, chosen pragmatically in consideration of the available computational power.
  While loop unrolling is a standard part of compiler optimization techniques, its use in testing is far less common. Part of the reason is that the concept, while seemingly intuitive, lacks a generally accepted and precise specification. The present article provides a formal definition and a set of formal properties of unrolling. All the properties have mechanically been proved correct (through the Isabelle proof assistant).
  Using this definition as the conceptual basis, we have applied an unrolling strategy to an existing automated testing framework and report the results: how many more bugs get detected once we unroll loops more than once?
  These results provide a first assessment of whether unrolling should become a standard part of test generation and test coverage measurement.</description>

      <title>Sampling from exponential distributions in the time domain with superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the superparamagnetic regime, magnetic tunnel junctions switch between two resistance states due to random thermal fluctuations. The dwell time distribution in each state is exponential. We sample this distribution using a temporal encoding scheme, in which information is encoded in the time at which the device switches between its resistance states. We then develop a circuit element known as a probabilistic delay cell that applies an electrical current step to a superparamagnetic tunnel junction and a temporal measurement circuit that measures the timing of the first switching event. Repeated experiments confirm that these times are exponentially distributed. Temporal processing methods then allow us to digitally compute with these exponentially distributed probabilistic delay cells. We describe how to use these circuits in a Metropolis-Hastings stepper and in a weighted random sampler, both of which are computationally intensive applications that benefit from the efficient generation of exponentially distributed random numbers.</description>

      <title>In Situ Optimization of an Optoelectronic Reservoir Computer with Digital Delayed Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is an innovative paradigm in neuromorphic computing that leverages fixed, randomized, internal connections to address the challenge of overfitting. RC has shown remarkable effectiveness in signal processing and pattern recognition tasks, making it well-suited for hardware implementations across various physical substrates, which promise enhanced computation speeds and reduced energy consumption. However, achieving optimal performance in RC systems requires effective parameter optimization. Traditionally, this optimization has relied on software modeling, limiting the practicality of physical computing approaches. Here, we report an \emph{in situ} optimization method for an optoelectronic delay-based RC system with digital delayed feedback. By simultaneously optimizing five parameters, normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.028, 0.561, and 0.271 is achieved in three benchmark tasks: waveform classification, time series prediction, and speech recognition outperforming simulation-based optimization (NMSE 0.054, 0.543, and 0.329, respectively) in the two of the three tasks. This method marks a significant advancement in physical computing, facilitating the optimization of RC and neuromorphic systems without the need for simulation, thus enhancing their practical applicability.</description>

      <title>Molecular Docking via Weighted Subgraph Isomorphism on Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is an essential step in the drug discovery process involving the detection of three-dimensional poses of a ligand inside the active site of the protein. In this paper, we address the Molecular Docking search phase by formulating the problem in QUBO terms, suitable for an annealing approach. We propose a problem formulation as a weighted subgraph isomorphism between the ligand graph and the grid of the target protein pocket. In particular, we applied a graph representation to the ligand embedding all the geometrical properties of the molecule including its flexibility, and we created a weighted spatial grid to the 3D space region inside the pocket. Results and performance obtained with quantum annealers are compared with classical simulated annealing solvers.</description>
