      <title>Scientific machine learning in Hydrology: a unified perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) provides a structured approach to integrating physical knowledge into data-driven modeling, offering significant potential for advancing hydrological research. In recent years, multiple methodological families have emerged, including physics-informed machine learning, physics-guided machine learning, hybrid physics-machine learning, and data-driven physics discovery. Within each of these families, a proliferation of heterogeneous approaches has developed independently, often without conceptual coordination. This fragmentation complicates the assessment of methodological novelty and makes it difficult to identify where meaningful advances can still be made in the absence of a unified conceptual framework. This review, the first focused overview of SciML in hydrology, addresses these limitations by proposing a unified methodological framework for each SciML family, bringing together representative contributions into a coherent structure that fosters conceptual clarity and supports cumulative progress in hydrological modeling. Finally, we highlight the limitations and future opportunities of each unified family to guide systematic research in hydrology, where these methods remain underutilized.</description>

      <title>Nature of Hydrated Electron in Varied Solvation Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of solvated electrons is important in studying a range of chemical and biological phenomena. This study investigates the structural and dynamical behavior of an excess electron in water, examining different solvation environments, including liquid water, ice, monolayer, and chain. To accurately model these systems, we carry out molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using hybrid density functionals, employing the computationally efficient resonance-free multiple time-stepping based adaptively compressed exchange operator method. Through these simulations, we create a comprehensive and detailed picture of how excess electrons are solvated across different aqueous environments. We report the factors influence the localization and dynamic stability of the hydrated electron. The determinants include the presence and reorganization flexibility of the dangling OH groups and the spatial arrangement of the surrounding water molecules.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Fine-Tuning Performance of Universal Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (U-MLIPs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine-learned interatomic potentials (U-MLIPs) have demonstrated effectiveness across diverse atomistic systems but often require fine-tuning for task-specific accuracy. We investigate the fine-tuning of two MACE-based foundation models, MACE-MP-0 and its variant MACE-MP-0b, and identify key insights. Fine-tuning on task-specific datasets enhances accuracy and, in some cases, outperforms models trained from scratch. Additionally, fine-tuned models benefit from faster convergence due to the strong initial predictions provided by the foundation model. The success of fine-tuning also depends on careful dataset selection, which can be optimized through filtering or active learning. We further discuss practical strategies for achieving better fine-tuning foundation models in atomistic simulations and explore future directions for their development and applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles Quantum Insights into Bandgap Engineering, Valley Quantum Hall Effect, and Nonlinear Optical Response of Ge-Doped Graphene for Potential Optoelectronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valley in the band structure of materials has gained a lot of attention recently. The promising applications of the valley degree of freedom include the next-generation valleytronic devices, quantum information processing, quantum computing, and optoelectronic devices. Graphene is an ideal quantum material for high-speed valleytronic applications because of its high carrier mobility and convenience of bandgap engineering. Employing first-principles density functional theoretical approach, this study opted bandgap engineering strategy via Germanium doping to open bandgap and enhance valley selectivity in graphene monolayers. The impact of Ge dopant concentration of 2%, 3.125%, 5.5%, and 12.5% is explored on the valleytronic; valley Hall effect, valley transport, and optical properties. The reported results demonstrate that bandgap, valley polarization, and second harmonic generation can be tuned effectively by varying doping concentration of Germanium. The Berry curvature profile is antisymmetric for corresponding K and K' valleys, thus leading to valley-dependent transport properties and a potential valley Hall effect. Finally, the second-order susceptibilities exhibit corresponding optical absorption peaks, indicating efficient second-harmonic generation due to the broken inversion symmetry. These findings highlight the potential of Ge-doped graphene for nonlinear optics and valleytronics applications, while providing novel insights into its topological phase and transport properties.</description>

      <title>A unified fluid model for nonthermal plasmas and reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a unified fluid modeling framework for reacting flows coupled with nonthermal plasmas (NTPs). Building upon the gas-plasma kinetics solver, ChemPlasKin, and the CFD library, OpenFOAM, the integrated solver, reactPlasFOAM, allows simulation of fully coupled plasma-combustion systems with versatility and high performance. By simplifying the governing equations according to the dominant physical phenomena at each stage, the solver seamlessly switches between four operating modes: streamer, spark, reacting flow, and ionic wind, using coherent data structures. Unlike conventional streamer solvers that rely on pre-tabulated or fitted electron transport properties and reaction rates as functions of the reduced electric field or electron temperature, our approach solves the electron Boltzmann equation (EBE) on the fly to update the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the cell level. This enables a high-fidelity representation of evolving plasma chemistry and dynamics by capturing temporal and spatial variations in mixture composition and temperature. To improve computational efficiency for this multiscale, multiphysics system, we employ adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) in the plasma channel, dynamic load balancing for parallelization, and time-step subcycling for fast and slow transport processes. The solver is first verified against six established plasma codes for positive-streamer simulations and benchmarked against Cantera for a freely propagating hydrogen flame, then applied to three cases: (1) spark discharge in airflow; (2) streamer propagation in a premixed flame; and (3) flame dynamics under non-breakdown electric fields. These applications validate the model's ability to predict NTP properties such as fast heating and radical production and demonstrate its potential to reveal two-way coupling between plasma and combustion.</description>

      <title>LT-PINN: Lagrangian Topology-conscious Physics-informed Neural Network for Boundary-focused Engineering Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06300v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful meshless tool for topology optimization, capable of simultaneously determining optimal topologies and physical solutions. However, conventional PINNs rely on density-based topology descriptions, which necessitate manual interpolation and limit their applicability to complex geometries. To address this, we propose Lagrangian topology-conscious PINNs (LT-PINNs), a novel framework for boundary-focused engineering optimization. By parameterizing the control variables of topology boundary curves as learnable parameters, LT-PINNs eliminate the need for manual interpolation and enable precise boundary determination. We further introduce specialized boundary condition loss function and topology loss function to ensure sharp and accurate boundary representations, even for intricate topologies. The accuracy and robustness of LT-PINNs are validated via two types of partial differential equations (PDEs), including elastic equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions and Laplace's equation with Neumann boundary conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate effectiveness of LT-PINNs on more complex time-dependent and time-independent flow problems without relying on measurement data, and showcase their engineering application potential in flow velocity rearrangement, transforming a uniform upstream velocity into a sine-shaped downstream profile. The results demonstrate (1) LT-PINNs achieve substantial reductions in relative L2 errors compared with the state-of-art density topology-oriented PINNs (DT-PINNs), (2) LT-PINNs can handle arbitrary boundary conditions, making them suitable for a wide range of PDEs, and (3) LT-PINNs can infer clear topology boundaries without manual interpolation, especially for complex topologies.</description>

      <title>An analysis of capital market through the lens of integral transforms: exploring efficient markets and information asymmetry</title>

Abstract: Post Modigliani and Miller (1958), the concept of usage of arbitrage created a permanent mark on the discourses of financial framework. The arbitrage process is largely based on information dissemination amongst the stakeholders operating in the financial market. The advent of the efficient market Hypothesis draws close to the M&amp;M hypothesis. Giving importance to the arbitrage process, which effects the price discovery in the stock market. This divided the market as random and efficient cohort system. The focus was on which information forms a key factor in deciding the price formation in the market. However, the conventional techniques of analysis do not permit the price cycles to be interpreted beyond its singular wave-like cyclical movement. The apparent cyclic measurement is not coherent as the technical analysis does not give sustained result. Hence adaption of theories and computation from mathematical methods of physics ensures that these cycles are decomposed and the effect of the broken-down cycles is interpreted to understand the overall effect of information on price formation and discovery. In order to break the cycle this paper uses spectrum analysis to decompose and understand the above-said phenomenon in determining the price behavior in National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).</description>

      <title>ChemGraph: An Agentic Framework for Computational Chemistry Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for Forward and Inverse Potential-Density Mappings in Classical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural operators are capable of capturing nonlinear mappings between infinite-dimensional functional spaces, offering a data-driven approach to modeling complex functional relationships in classical density functional theory (cDFT). In this work, we evaluate the performance of several neural operator architectures in learning the functional relationships between the one-body density profile $\rho(x)$, the one-body direct correlation function $c_1(x)$, and the external potential $V_{ext}(x)$ of inhomogeneous one-dimensional (1D) hard-rod fluids, using training data generated from analytical solutions of the underlying statistical-mechanical model. We compared their performance in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss in establishing the functional relationships as well as in predicting the excess free energy across two test sets: (1) a group test set generated via random cross-validation (CV) to assess interpolation capability, and (2) a newly constructed dataset for leave-one-group CV to evaluate extrapolation performance. Our results show that FNO achieves the most accurate predictions of the excess free energy, with the squared ReLU activation function outperforming other activation choices. Among the DeepONet variants, the Residual Multiscale Convolutional Neural Network (RMSCNN) combined with a trainable Gaussian derivative kernel (GK-RMSCNN-DeepONet) demonstrates the best performance. Additionally, we applied the trained models to solve for the density profiles at various external potentials and compared the results with those obtained from the direct mapping $V_{ext} \mapsto \rho$ with neural operators, as well as with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) combined with Active Learning by Error Control (ALEC), which has shown strong performance in previous studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extended-MHD model, interfaced with tabular equation-of-state and conductivity models, has been developed in PERSEUS (Physics as an Extended-MHD Relaxation System with an Efficient Upwind Scheme) for simulating a plasma-vacuum interface under experimentally-relevant conditions for a pulsed-power system, and with minimal sensitivity to parameters characterizing the numerical vacuum. For several test problems, we demonstrate convergence of this model for sufficiently low density floors and with respect to certain vacuum parameters. This capability is crucial for predictively modeling the coupling of energy and current onto a target in a pulsed-power system.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient-Descent Calibration of Pyragas Delayed-Feedback Control for Chaos Suppression in the Sprott Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates chaos control in the Sprott circuit, a minimal electronic system exhibiting complex nonlinear dynamics. Using the third-order nonlinear differential equation from Kaveh Merat paper, we model the circuit and implement delayed feedback control to suppress chaos. Experimental voltage data were extracted from published figures via WebPlotDigitizer. Then we explore two calibration techniques: Minimizing sum of squared errors (SSE), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with finite differences. Joint optimization of control parameters and the variable resistor achieves the best alignment with experimental data, accurately capturing phase and amplitude. SGD outperforms grid search in phase synchronization, though amplitude discrepancies persist due to model simplifications. The trade-off between accuracy and computational cost is analyzed, revealing scalability challenges in chaotic system calibration. Phase space analysis validates the model ability to replicate the chaotic attractor geometry, despite minor deviations. Overall, Stochastic Gradient Descent based calibration of chaotic nonlinear systems shows significant potential for advancing mathematical modeling and electrical engineering.</description>

      <title>Direct numerical simulation of complete transition to turbulence with a fluid at supercritical pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to investigate the unexplored laminar-to-turbulent transition of a heated flat-plate boundary layer with a fluid at supercritical pressure. Two temperature ranges are considered: a subcritical case, where the fluid remains entirely in the liquid-like regime, and a transcritical case, where the pseudo-critical (Widom) line is crossed and pseudo-boiling occurs. Fully compressible direct numerical simulations are used to study (i) the linear and nonlinear instabilities, (ii) the breakdown to turbulence, and (iii) the fully developed turbulent boundary layer. In the transcritical regime, two-dimensional forcing generates not only a train of billow-like structures around the Widom line, resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, but also near-wall travelling regions of flow reversal. These spanwise-oriented billows dominate the early nonlinear stage. When high subharmonic three-dimensional forcing is applied, staggered $\Lambda$-vortices emerge more abruptly than in the subcritical case. However, unlike the classic H-type breakdown under zero pressure gradient observed in ideal-gas and subcritical regimes, the H-type breakdown is triggered by strong shear layers caused by flow reversals -- similar to that observed in adverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers. Without oblique wave forcing, transition is only slightly delayed and follows a naturally selected fundamental breakdown (K-type) scenario. Hence, in the transcritical regime, it is possible to trigger nonlinearities and achieve transition to turbulence relatively early using only a single two-dimensional wave that strongly amplifies background noise. In the fully turbulent region, we demonstrate that variable-property scaling accurately predicts turbulent skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure and transport in materials with flat bands: 2D materials and quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present our recent works on materials whose common point is the presence of electronic bands of very low dispersion, called "flat bands", which are always the signature of an electronic confinement. A first part is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range geometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic approximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and twisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose rotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called "magic angle". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states distributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even thousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such as "heterostrain". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by usual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity operator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned. In twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other electron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D nanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant electronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies on monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes, monolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result is the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer graphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the functionalized sublattice type. This result, which seems to be confirmed by very recent experimental measurements, suggests that functionalization can be a key parameter to control the electronic properties of two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Fourth- and higher-order finite element methods for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the unconstrained pressure Poisson equation (PPE) formulation [Liu, Liu, \&amp; Pego, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 60 (2007): 1443-1487], we previously proposed the generic projection and unconstrained PPE (GePUP) formulation [Zhang, J. Sci. Comput. 67 (2016): 1134-1180] for numerically solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (INSE) with no-slip boundary conditions. In GePUP, the main evolutionary variable does not have to be solenoidal with its divergence controlled by a heat equation. This work presents high-order finite-element solvers for the INSE under the framework of method-of-lines. Continuous Lagrange finite elements of equal order are utilized for the velocity and pressure finite element spaces to discretize the weak form of GePUP in space, while high-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta methods are then employed to treat the stiff diffusion term implicitly and the other terms explicitly. Due to the implicit treatment of the diffusion term, the time step size is only restricted by convection. The solver is efficient in that advancing the solution at each time step only involves solving a sequence of linear systems either on the velocity or on the pressure with geometric multigrid methods. Furthermore, the solver is enhanced with adaptive mesh refinement so that the multiple length scales and time scales in flows at moderate or high Reynolds numbers can be efficiently resolved. Numerical tests with various Reynolds numbers are performed for the single-vortex test, the lid-driven cavity, and the flow past a cylinder/sphere, demonstrating the high-order accuracy of GePUP-FEM both in time and in space and its capability of accurately and efficiently capturing the right physics. Moreover, our solver offers the flexibility in choosing velocity and pressure finite element spaces and is free of the standard inf-sup condition.</description>

      <title>New highly efficient and accurate numerical scheme for the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on a generalized scalar auxiliary variable approach with relaxation (R-GSAV), we construct a class of high-order backward differentiation formula (BDF) schemes with variable time steps for the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman(CHB) system. In theory, it is strictly proved that the designed schemes are unconditionally energy-stable. With the delicate treatment of adaptive strategies, we propose several adaptive time-step algorithms to enhance the robustness of the schemes. More importantly, a novel hybrid-order adaptive time steps algorithm performs outstanding for the coupled system. The hybrid-order algorithm inherits the advantages of some traditional high-order BDF adaptive strategies. A comprehensive comparison with some adaptive time-step algorithms is given, and the advantages of the new adaptive time-step algorithms are emphasized. Finally, the effectiveness and accuracy of the new methods are validated through a series of numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are examined. Explicit 2N-storage constraints are derived for the first time and used to establish new relations between the entries of the Butcher tableau. An error in the Williamson's formula for converting coefficients between the standard and 2N-storage formats in the special case is pointed out and corrected. The new relations are used to derive a closed-form solution for four- and five-stage 2N-storage methods with the third order of global accuracy. Several new four- and five-stage schemes with rational coefficients are presented and numerically examined for illustration.</description>

      <title>Tunable Coloration in Core-Shell Plasmonic Nanopixels Based on Organic Conductive Polymers: A First-Principles and FDTD Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From raindrops to planets, the scattering of electromagnetic fields introduces exciting phenomena that can be utilized for display devices. Here, we designed an electrochromic nanoparticle on mirror (eNPoM) structure with core-shell geometries for low-power nanoscale pixels with rapid coloration abilities based on four electrochromic organic conducting polymers utilizing the first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Au nanoparticles are coated with electrochromic conductive polymers (such as PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh) and positioned on the metal mirror. The electric field enhancement and the impact of shell thickness are analyzed. Dielectric properties of all polymers resulting from atomistic calculation were utilized for FDTD simulation, which helps to correlate the direct relationship between polymer structure and optical properties. Notably, the study reveals significant wavelength tunability of 100nm, 40nm, 70nm, and over 40nm using PANI, PEDOT, PPy, and PTh shells, respectively. Additionally, the potential for RGB color production using a TiN layer on the mirror is explored. For the first time, complex structures such as bow tie and gear were utilized to model the nanopixels studied and a significant absorption peak shift was observed. Chromaticity coordinates in the CIE 1931 color space and CIELAB2000 color difference quantify color change capabilities during the redox cycle, and a comparative analysis of organic and inorganic materials highlights the prospects of the proposed plasmonic nanopixels.</description>

      <title>Predicting aqueous and electrochemical stability of 2D materials from extended Pourbaix analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge for computational discovery of electrocatalytic materials is the reliable prediction of thermodynamic stability in aqueous environment and under different electrochemical conditions. In this work, we first evaluate the electrochemical stability of more than 3000 two-dimensional (2D) materials using conventional Pourbaix diagrams (CPDs). Due to the complete neglect of thermodynamic barriers along the (often complex) reaction pathways, the vast majority of the materials are predicted to be unstable even though some are known to be stable in practice. We then introduce an analysis based on the surface Pourbaix diagram (SPD) including 'early intermediate states' that represent the first steps of the key surface passivation and dissolution reactions. The SPD framework is applied to the 2D materials MoS$_2$, phosphorene, and the MXene Ti$_2$C, all of which are predicted to be unstable by the CPD. For MoS$_2$, our approach reproduces the experimental pH-U stability window as well as the experimental desulphurization potential. For phosphorene and Ti2$_C$, the SPD approach is used to investigate the spontaneous degradation mechanism and the potential-dependent surface termination, respectively, again yielding good agreement with experiments. The SPD-based stability analysis emerges as a versatile and quantitative method for prediction of stability and investigation of surface structures in electrochemical environments.</description>

      <title>Jarzynski Reweighting and Sampling Dynamics for Training Energy-Based Models: Theoretical Analysis of Different Transition Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) provide a flexible framework for generative modeling, but their training remains theoretically challenging due to the need to approximate normalization constants and efficiently sample from complex, multi-modal distributions. Traditional methods, such as contrastive divergence and score matching, introduce biases that can hinder accurate learning. In this work, we present a theoretical analysis of Jarzynski reweighting, a technique from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and its implications for training EBMs. We focus on the role of the choice of the kernel and we illustrate these theoretical considerations in two key generative frameworks: (i) flow-based diffusion models, where we reinterpret Jarzynski reweighting in the context of stochastic interpolants to mitigate discretization errors and improve sample quality, and (ii) Restricted Boltzmann Machines, where we analyze its role in correcting the biases of contrastive divergence. Our results provide insights into the interplay between kernel choice and model performance, highlighting the potential of Jarzynski reweighting as a principled tool for generative learning.</description>

      <title>Dense Associative Memory in a Nonlinear Optical Hopfield Neural Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Hopfield Neural Networks (HNNs), also known as Dense Associative Memories (DAMs), enhance the performance of simple recurrent neural networks by leveraging the nonlinearities in their energy functions. They have broad applications in combinatorial optimization, high-capacity memory storage, deep learning transformers, and correlated pattern recognition. Thus far, research on DAMs has been primarily theoretical, with implementations limited to CPUs and GPUs. In this work, for the first time to our knowledge, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a nonlinear optical Hopfield neural network (NOHNN) system for realizing DAMs using correlated patterns. Our NOHNN incorporates effective 2-body and 4-body interactions in its energy function. The inclusion of 4-body interaction scores a minimum ten-fold improvement in the number of uncorrelated patterns that can be stored and retrieved, significantly surpassing the traditional capacity limit for traditional HNNs. For correlated patterns, depending on their average correlation, up to 50 times more patterns can be stored compared to traditional HNNs. To test the system's robustness, the benchmark testing is performed on MNIST handwritten digit patterns. The results show a 5.5 times improvement in the pattern storage along with the retrieval of cleaner and less noisy patterns. These results highlight the potential of nonlinear optical DAMs for practical applications in challenging big-data optimization, computer vision and graph network tasks.</description>

      <title>FunDiff: Diffusion Models over Function Spaces for Physics-Informed Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling -- particularly diffusion models and flow matching -- have achieved remarkable success in synthesizing discrete data such as images and videos. However, adapting these models to physical applications remains challenging, as the quantities of interest are continuous functions governed by complex physical laws. Here, we introduce $\textbf{FunDiff}$, a novel framework for generative modeling in function spaces. FunDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to handle input functions with varying discretizations, generate continuous functions evaluable at arbitrary locations, and seamlessly incorporate physical priors. These priors are enforced through architectural constraints or physics-informed loss functions, ensuring that generated samples satisfy fundamental physical laws. We theoretically establish minimax optimality guarantees for density estimation in function spaces, showing that diffusion-based estimators achieve optimal convergence rates under suitable regularity conditions. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of FunDiff across diverse applications in fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy and low-resolution data.

      <title>Uncovering the Functional Roles of Nonlinearity in Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory and long-range temporal processing are core requirements for sequence modeling tasks across natural language processing, time-series forecasting, speech recognition, and control. While nonlinear recurrence has long been viewed as essential for enabling such mechanisms, recent work suggests that linear dynamics may often suffice. In this study, we go beyond performance comparisons to systematically dissect the functional role of nonlinearity in recurrent networks--identifying both when it is computationally necessary, and what mechanisms it enables. We use Almost Linear Recurrent Neural Networks (AL-RNNs), which allow fine-grained control over nonlinearity, as both a flexible modeling tool and a probe into the internal mechanisms of memory. Across a range of classic sequence modeling tasks and a real-world stimulus selection task, we find that minimal nonlinearity is not only sufficient but often optimal, yielding models that are simpler, more robust, and more interpretable than their fully nonlinear or linear counterparts. Our results provide a principled framework for selectively introducing nonlinearity, bridging dynamical systems theory with the functional demands of long-range memory and structured computation in recurrent neural networks, with implications for both artificial and biological neural systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Quantum Transport in Disordered 2D Hexagonal Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce scalable machine learning models to accurately predict two key quantum transport properties, the transmission coefficient T(E) and the local density of states (LDOS) in two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal materials with magnetic disorder. Using a tight binding Hamiltonian combined with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) formalism, we generate a large dataset of over 400,000 unique configurations across graphene, germanene, silicene, and stanene nanoribbons with varying geometries, impurity concentrations, and energy levels. A central contribution of this work is the development of a geometrydriven, physically interpretable feature space that enables the models to generalize across material types and device sizes. Random Forest regression and classification models are evaluated in terms of accuracy, stability, and extrapolation ability. Regression consistently outperforms classification in capturing continuous transport behavior on in-domain data. However, extrapolation performance degrades significantly, revealing the limitations of tree-based models in unseen regimes. This study highlights both the potential and constraints of scalable ML models for quantum transport prediction and motivates future research into physics-informed or graph-based learning architectures for improved generalization in spintronic and nanoelectronic device design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have provided compelling and renewed interest in phonon hydrodynamics. At variance with ordinary diffusive heat transport, this regime is primarily governed by momentum-conserving phonon collisions. At the mesoscopic scale it can be described by the viscous heat equations (VHE), that resemble the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) in the laminar regime. Here, we show that the VHE can be separated and recast as modified biharmonic equations in the velocity potential and stream function$-$solvable analytically. These two can be merged into a complex potential defining the flow streamlines, and give rise to two distinct temperature contributions, ultimately related to thermal compressibility and vorticity. The irrotational and incompressible limits of the phonon VHE are analyzed, showing how the latter mirrors the NSE for the electron fluid. This work also extends to the electron compressible regime that arises when drift velocities can be higher than plasmonic velocities. Finally, by examining thermal flow within a 2D graphite strip device, we explore the boundary conditions and transport coefficients needed to observe thermal vortices and negative thermal resistance, or heat backflow from cooler to warmer regions. This work provides novel analytical tools to design hydrodynamic phonon flow, highlights its generalization for electron hydrodynamics, and promotes additional avenues to explore experimentally such fascinating phenomena.</description>

      <title>clusttraj: A Solvent-Informed Clustering Tool for Molecular Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering techniques are consolidated as a powerful strategy for analyzing the extensive data generated from molecular modeling. In particular, some tools have been developed to cluster configurations from classical simulations with a standard focus on individual units, ranging from small molecules to complex proteins. Since the standard approach includes computing the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of atomic positions, accounting for the permutation between atoms is crucial for optimizing the clustering procedure in the presence of identical molecules. To address this issue, we present the clusttraj program, a solvent-informed clustering package that fixes inflated RMSD values by finding the optimal pairing between configurations. The program combines reordering schemes with the Kabsch algorithm to minimize the RMSD of molecular configurations before running a hierarchical clustering protocol. By considering evaluation metrics, one can determine the ideal threshold in an automated fashion and compare the different linkage schemes available. The program capabilities are exemplified by considering solute-solvent systems ranging from pure water clusters to a solvated protein or a small solute in different solvents. As a result, we investigate the dependence on different parameters, such as the system size and reordering method, and also the representativeness of the cluster medoids for the characterization of optical properties. clusttraj is implemented as a Python library and can be employed to cluster generic ensembles of molecular configurations that go beyond solute-solvent systems.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network for the Era of Large Atomistic Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundation models, or large atomistic models (LAMs), aim to universally represent the ground-state potential energy surface (PES) of atomistic systems as defined by density functional theory (DFT). The scaling law is pivotal in the development of large models, suggesting that their generalizability in downstream tasks consistently improves with increased model size, expanded training datasets, and larger computational budgets. In this study, we present DPA3, a multi-layer graph neural network founded on line graph series (LiGS), designed explicitly for the era of LAMs. We demonstrate that the generalization error of the DPA3 model adheres to the scaling law. The scalability in the number of model parameters is attained by stacking additional layers within DPA3. Additionally, the model employs a dataset encoding mechanism that decouples the scaling of training data size from the model size within its multi-task training framework. When trained as problem-oriented potential energy models, the DPA3 model exhibits superior accuracy in the majority of benchmark cases, encompassing systems with diverse features, including molecules, bulk materials, surface and cluster catalysts, two-dimensional materials, and battery materials. When trained as a LAM on the OpenLAM-v1 dataset, the DPA-3.1-3M model exhibits state-of-the-art performance in the LAMBench benchmark suite for LAMs, demonstrating lowest overall zero-shot generalization error across 17 downstream tasks from a broad spectrum of research domains. This performance suggests superior accuracy as an out-of-the-box potential model, requiring minimal fine-tuning data for downstream scientific applications.</description>

      <title>BridgeNet: A Hybrid, Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck Equations</title>

Abstract: BridgeNet is a novel hybrid framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with physics-informed neural networks to efficiently solve non-linear, high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations (FPEs). Traditional PINNs, which typically rely on fully connected architectures, often struggle to capture complex spatial hierarchies and enforce intricate boundary conditions. In contrast, BridgeNet leverages adaptive CNN layers for effective local feature extraction and incorporates a dynamically weighted loss function that rigorously enforces physical constraints. Extensive numerical experiments across various test cases demonstrate that BridgeNet not only achieves significantly lower error metrics and faster convergence compared to conventional PINN approaches but also maintains robust stability in high-dimensional settings. This work represents a substantial advancement in computational physics, offering a scalable and accurate solution methodology with promising applications in fields ranging from financial mathematics to complex system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Universal machine learning interatomic potentials poised to supplant DFT in modeling general defects in metals and random alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, combined with the generation of extensive density functional theory (DFT) datasets, have enabled the development of universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs). These models offer broad applicability across the periodic table, achieving first-principles accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional DFT calculations. In this study, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art pretrained uMLIPs can effectively replace DFT for accurately modeling complex defects in a wide range of metals and alloys. Our investigation spans diverse scenarios, including grain boundaries and general defects in pure metals, defects in high-entropy alloys, hydrogen-alloy interactions, and solute-defect interactions. Remarkably, the latest EquiformerV2 models achieve DFT-level accuracy on comprehensive defect datasets, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 5 meV/atom for energies and 100 meV/{\AA} for forces, outperforming specialized machine learning potentials such as moment tensor potential and atomic cluster expansion. We also present a systematic analysis of accuracy versus computational cost and explore uncertainty quantification for uMLIPs. A detailed case study of tungsten (W) demonstrates that data on pure W alone is insufficient for modeling complex defects in uMLIPs, underscoring the critical importance of advanced machine learning architectures and diverse datasets, which include over 100 million structures spanning all elements. These findings establish uMLIPs as a robust alternative to DFT and a transformative tool for accelerating the discovery and design of high-performance materials.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Mapping: Revolutionizing Predictive Models for Divertor Plasma Detachment Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of boundary plasma, characterized by multi-scale and multi-physics challenges, has historically restricted high-fidelity simulations to scientific research due to their intensive computational demands. Consequently, routine applications such as discharge control and scenario development have relied on faster, but less accurate empirical methods. This work introduces DivControlNN, a novel machine-learning-based surrogate model designed to address these limitations by enabling quasi-real-time predictions (i.e., $\sim0.2$ ms) of boundary and divertor plasma behavior. Trained on over 70,000 2D UEDGE simulations from KSTAR tokamak equilibria, DivControlNN employs latent space mapping to efficiently represent complex divertor plasma states, achieving a computational speed-up of over $10^8$ compared to traditional simulations while maintaining a relative error below 20% for key plasma property predictions. During the 2024 KSTAR experimental campaign, a prototype detachment control system powered by DivControlNN successfully demonstrated detachment control on its first attempt, even for a new tungsten divertor configuration and without any fine-tuning. These results highlight the transformative potential of DivControlNN in overcoming diagnostic challenges in future fusion reactors by providing fast, robust, and reliable predictions for advanced integrated control systems.</description>

      <title>Unconventional compensated magnetic material LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional magnetism including altermagnetism and unconventional compensated magnetism, characterized by its duality of real-space antiferromagnetic alignment and momentum-space spin splitting, has garnered widespread attention. While altermagnetism has been extensively studied, research on unconventional compensated magnetism remains very rare. In particular, unconventional compensated magnetic materials are only theoretically predicted and have not yet been synthesized experimentally. In this study, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ is a unconventional compensated magnetic semiconductor. Given that the Mn ions at opposite spin lattice cannot be connected by any symmetry, the spin splitting in LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ is isotropic. More importantly, LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ has already been synthesized experimentally, and its magnetic structure has been confirmed by neutron scattering experiments. Therefore, LaMn$_2$SbO$_6$ serves as an excellent material platform for investigating the novel physical properties of unconventional compensated magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &amp; $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.</description>

      <title>Learning-at-Criticality in Large Language Models for Quantum Field Theory and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physics often confronts complex symbolic problems with few guiding exemplars or established principles. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promise, its typical need for vast datasets to learn from hinders its use in these information-scarce frontiers. We introduce learning at criticality (LaC), a reinforcement learning (RL) scheme that tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to a sharp learning transition, addressing this information scarcity. At this transition, LLMs achieve peak generalization from minimal data, exemplified by 7-digit base-7 addition -- a test of nontrivial arithmetic reasoning. To elucidate this peak, we analyze a minimal concept-network model (CoNet) designed to capture the essence of how LLMs might link tokens. Trained on a single exemplar, this model also undergoes a sharp learning transition. This transition exhibits hallmarks of a second-order phase transition, notably power-law distributed solution path lengths. At this critical point, the system maximizes a ``critical thinking pattern" crucial for generalization, enabled by the underlying scale-free exploration. This suggests LLMs reach peak performance by operating at criticality, where such explorative dynamics enable the extraction of underlying operational rules. We demonstrate LaC in quantum field theory: an 8B-parameter LLM, tuned to its critical point by LaC using a few exemplars of symbolic Matsubara sums, solves unseen, higher-order problems, significantly outperforming far larger models. LaC thus leverages critical phenomena, a physical principle, to empower AI for complex, data-sparse challenges in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Toward Greater Autonomy in Materials Discovery Agents: Unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim at designing language agents with greater autonomy for crystal materials discovery. While most of existing studies restrict the agents to perform specific tasks within predefined workflows, we aim to automate workflow planning given high-level goals and scientist intuition. To this end, we propose Materials Agent unifying Planning, Physics, and Scientists, known as MAPPS. MAPPS consists of a Workflow Planner, a Tool Code Generator, and a Scientific Mediator. The Workflow Planner uses large language models (LLMs) to generate structured and multi-step workflows. The Tool Code Generator synthesizes executable Python code for various tasks, including invoking a force field foundation model that encodes physics. The Scientific Mediator coordinates communications, facilitates scientist feedback, and ensures robustness through error reflection and recovery. By unifying planning, physics, and scientists, MAPPS enables flexible and reliable materials discovery with greater autonomy, achieving a five-fold improvement in stability, uniqueness, and novelty rates compared with prior generative models when evaluated on the MP-20 data. We provide extensive experiments across diverse tasks to show that MAPPS is a promising framework for autonomous materials discovery.</description>
