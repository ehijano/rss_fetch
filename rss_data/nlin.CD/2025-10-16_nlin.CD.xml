      <title>Dynamics of reservoir computing for crises prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing has emerged as a powerful framework for time series modelling and forecasting including the prediction of discontinuous transitions. However, the mechanism behind its success is not yet fully understood. This letter elucidates the functioning of reservoir computing by examining its successful prediction of boundary and attractor merging crises. We investigate in detail how reservoirs's internal dynamics mimic the actual system, that enables it to accurately reproduce the scaling exponent near boundary crisis. We establish this across distinct systems, exemplified by the logistic and Gauss maps. The study contributes to the broader understanding of the internal dynamics that enable learning algorithms to anticipate critical transitions.</description>

      <title>S-Expansiveness and Zip Shift Maps in Symbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of S-expansiveness for local homeomorphisms and demonstrate that a class of extended symbolic dynamics, known as zip shift maps, are S-expansive and possess the shadowing property. Furthermore, we prove that any S-expansive local homeomorphism is a factor of a zip shift map.</description>

      <title>Computation of minimal periods for ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the shortest possible period for an exactly periodic solution to some given autonomous ordinary differential equation. We show that, given a pair of Lyapunov-like observable functions defined over the state space of the corresponding dynamical system and satisfying a certain pointwise inequality, we can obtain a global lower bound for such periods. We give a method valid for the case of bounding the period of only those solutions which are invariant under a symmetry transformation, as well as bounds for general periodic orbits. If the governing equations are polynomial in the state variables, we can use semidefinite programming to find such auxiliary functions computationally, and thus compute lower bounds which can be rigorously validated using rational arithmetic. We apply our method to the Lorenz and Henon-Heiles systems. For both systems we are able to give validated bounds which are sharp to several decimal places.</description>

      <title>Eigenstates and spectral projection for quantized baker's map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the approach from [arXiv:2110.15301] to prove windowed spectral projection estimates and a generalized Weyl law for the (Weyl) quantized baker's map on the torus. The spectral window is allowed to shrink in the semiclassical (large dimension) limit. As a consequence, we obtain a strengthening of the quantum ergodic theorem from [arXiv:math-ph/0412058] to hold in shrinking spectral windows, a Weyl law on uniform spreading of eigenvalues, and statistics of random quasimodes. Using similar techniques, we also investigate random eigenbases of a different (non-Weyl) quantization, the Walsh-quantized baker's map, which has high degeneracies in its spectrum. For such random eigenbases, we prove that Gaussian eigenstate statistics and QUE hold with high probability in the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources within Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local-operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, {and bears witness to many-body chaos for local dynamics}. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. {In terms of a previous conjecture on the characteristic scaling of LOE, our results also mean that non-integrable spin chains cannot be simulated classically}. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>
