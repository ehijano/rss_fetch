      <title>Baby universe as logical qubits: information recovery in random encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit whether a semiclassical baby universe in AdS/CFT necessarily possess a trivial one-dimensional Hilbert space or may instead carry a large entropy. Recent results on Haar random encoding suggest a breakdown of complementary recovery, in which no logical operators can be reconstructed from individual bipartite subsystems. Motivated by this, we propose an interpretation where a baby universe emerges as logical degrees of freedom that cannot be accessed from either boundary alone, assuming pseudorandom dynamics in holographic CFTs. We then analyze two conceptual puzzles: an apparent cloning of baby-universe microstates and its eventual fate at the singularity. Both puzzles are avoided because no single boundary observer can access the baby-universe degrees of freedom, be it classical or quantum, reflecting an emergent form of complementarity due to the structure of random encoding. In this interpretation, observers arise naturally: the same heavy operator that prepares the baby-universe geometry also serves as observer-like degrees of freedom that define an observer-dependent baby-universe microstate.</description>

      <title>Locality constraints in AdS$_2$ without parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>On the role of Area Metrics in AdS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential role of area metrics, a generalised notion of geometry, in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Guided by the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and the first law of entanglement, we derive both a holographic dictionary as well as a bulk equation of motion for area metric fluctuations linearised around a four dimensional AdS background. Furthermore, we explore potential bulk Lagrangians that could give rise to the derived equation. It is shown that writing area metric fluctuations in terms of Lanczos like potentials gives rise to a particularly elegant bulk model.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity of Supersymmetric SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of supersymmetry breaking on Krylov complexity in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK model under irrelevant and mass deformations of the Hamiltonian. The irrelevant deformation breaks $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry down to $\mathcal{N}=1$, while the mass deformation breaks supersymmetry completely. Using Krylov subspace methods, we analyze the Lanczos sequence, Krylov dimension, complexity, and entropy at finite system size as functions of deformation strength. Both deformations enlarge the Krylov space, but the mass deformation has a stronger effect. Krylov complexity exhibits initial quadratic growth, followed by linear growth across both deformations. We observe that both deformations increase the quadratic and linear growth rates of Krylov complexity at early times. At late times, the irrelevant deformation increases the saturation complexity as a fraction of the Krylov dimension, while the mass deformation decreases it. This reveals distinct signatures of how supersymmetry breaking impacts quantum complexity.</description>

      <title>Exact WKB in all sectors II: Potentials with non-degenerate saddles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the exact quantization of general one-dimensional potentials in view of the exact-WKB formalism. Building on our previous work, we perform analytic continuations across different sectors via the complexification to the spectral (energy) parameter $u$ and identify continuous and discontinuous transitions of the exact spectrum for generic potentials. When the transition is discontinuous, it is characterized by the Stokes phenomena, inducing different exact (median) quantization conditions, thereby distinct trans-series structures valid in different sectors. We analyze two illustrative examples, namely asymmetric triple-well (ATW) and tilted double-well (TDW), and verify the general qualitative analysis by deriving exact (median) quantization conditions in each sector. Moreover, by obtaining the trans-series solutions for each system, we identify bion/bounce configurations and show that the trans-series of ATW is organized in accordance with the cluster expansion of the bion gas and there should exist a previously neglected complex saddle in the TDW system. These identifications further strengthen the link between path integral and exact-WKB formalisms, while also demonstrating the predictive power of the latter. In parallel, for the P-NP relations of genus-1 systems, we derive transformation rules between any perturbative and non-perturbative pair of WKB-cycles. Our results show that the entire resurgence data of a genus-1 system transforms only by the change of classical parameters, i.e. frequencies and bion/bounce actions, and the perturbative energy series. This also reveals the underlying reasons of the previously found $S$-duality transformations.</description>

      <title>Marginal Operators from Celestial Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given conformal field theory (CFT), one can deform it via the addition of a marginal operator to the spectrum. In two dimensions, when the added operator has conformal weights $h=\bar{h}=1$, conformal symmetry is not broken and the resulting theory is a distinct CFT. Studying such marginal operators for celestial CFTs allows for a geometric understanding of the space of allowed boundary theories dual to quantum field theories (QFT) in bulk asymptotically flat spacetimes. In traditional holographic examples, a marginal deformation on the boundary corresponds to a vacuum transition in the bulk theory. We affirm this in celestial CFTs which requires a general definition of marginal operators as composite celestial operators via pairs that live at distinct corners of celestial memory and Goldstone diamonds.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional non-relativistic chiral massive higher-spin gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a non-relativistic chiral massive higher-spin gravity in a deformed $AdS_3$ spacetime by applying a Lifshitz deformation and subsequent null reduction to chiral massless higher-spin gravity in $AdS_4$. Intriguingly, the vertices of this non-relativistic theory are less constrained than the ones of the original $4d$ chiral massless theory since we do not have enough dynamical generators to fix the couplings uniquely. Anticipating higher-spin interactions should be suppressed, we propose a simple approximate mass-spin relation which interpolates between the relativistic and non-relativistic regimes. With the proposed mass-spin relation, we observe that that higher-spin interactions indeed become suppressed at large spins, consistent with low-energy physics. We conjecture that the holographic dual of the non-relativistic chiral massive higher-spin gravity proposed in this work is a $2d$ non-relativistic Landau-Ginzburg theory in the light-cone gauge. This non-relativistic theory is expected to describe a two-fluid system with a $\lambda$-point constrained in one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Towards six W-boson amplitude at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the planar integrand of the six-leg amplitude of massive W-bosons on the special Coulomb branch of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to two-loop order. We use the six-dimensional supersymmetric spinor-helicity formalism and the generalized unitarity-cut sewing technique to perform this analysis. The thus-found expression corresponds in the massless limit to the six-gluon maximally helicity-violating amplitude. The upshot of the current consideration is that the former is just an uplift of the latter from four to six dimensions. This repeats the pattern found earlier for four- and five-leg amplitudes of massive W-bosons.</description>

      <title>Holographic entanglement entropy and c-functions in conformal and confining backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate holographic spacelike and timelike entanglement entropy using the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription, for slab-shaped and ball-shaped entangling regions. We work with an infinite family of 10-dimensional Type IIB supergravity solutions, which are gravity duals to an infinite set of linear quiver theories, with the backgrounds defined using the electrostatic potential formalism for brane configurations. The dual theories are 4-dimensional confining theories at low energy, but decompactify and flow to 5-dimensional SCFTs in the UV. We find that the entanglement entropy exhibits phase transition behaviour, and we use our results to investigate proposed c-functions constructed from the entanglement entropy. Comparing with the flow central charge, another proposed c-function, we find that each displays good behaviour, and reflects both UV and IR features of the dual theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of models in even spacetime dimensions $2n$ which share many similarities with Chern-Simons theories in odd spacetime dimensions $2n+1$. The independent dynamical variables of these models are a $GL(2n)$-connection and a metric in internal space. The action is a polynomial of degree $n$ in the curvature of the connection, with indices saturated by means of the metric and the Levi-Civita tensor. We show that the theory has no local degree of freedom in $2$ spacetime dimensions ($n=1$), where it can be reformulated as a constrained $BF$ model, but that its dynamics is more intrincate in higher dimensions ($n&gt;1$), where local degrees of freedom are present. We treat in detail the cases of $2$ and $4$ spacetime dimensions.}</description>

      <title>From closed to open strings: the tensionless route in Kalb-Ramond background and noncommutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tensionless bosonic strings propagating in the presence of a constant Kalb-Ramond background and show how closed strings undergo a transition into open strings in this regime. The tensionless (Carrollian) limit induces a universal gluing between the worldsheet oscillators, which we generalize to include the effects of a constant $B$-field. We derive the modified mixed boundary conditions, construct the corresponding gluing matrix and obtain the generalized induced vacuum as a squeezed boundary state. This vacuum continuously emerges from the closed string vacuum through a Bogoliubov transformation, providing a precise realization of the closed-to-open string transition. We further extend the analysis to toroidal compactifications, and show that the mechanism of worldsheet Bose-Einstein condensation persists unaltered. In the second part of the paper, we give a unified symplectic derivation of the open string noncommutative parameter. We show that the boundary symplectic form alone determines the noncommutative geometry, and that in the tensionless limit the $B$-field term becomes the unique surviving contribution. Its inverse produces a noncommutative parameter similar to the Seiberg-Witten result, but arising intrinsically from the Carrollian worldsheet dynamics. Our results establish a coherent picture in which the emergence of open strings, boundary noncommutativity, and generalized vacuum structure all arise naturally from the worldsheet geometry of null strings in a $B$-field background.</description>

      <title>Magnetic corrections to the classical soft photon theorems at all orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a set of charged or dyonic objects scatter and subsequently disperse, the process generically emits electromagnetic radiation. The classical soft photon theorem constrains the constant term and leading power-law fall-off of the emitted waveform at asymptotic times solely in terms of the momenta and charges of the incoming and outgoing particles. In this work, we extend the analysis to include the full tower of subleading corrections in the late-time and early-time expansion of the electric and magnetic waveforms, providing explicit expressions that depend only on the kinematic data and the electric and magnetic charges of the scattered objects. Using independent electric and magnetic potentials, we compute the full classical soft expansion for general dyonic scattering. We provide explicit, recursive expressions for the trajectory coefficients and the resulting electric and magnetic waveforms. The resulting soft expansion exhibits manifest covariance under the electric-magnetic duality. The electric and magnetic waveforms transform as an $SO(2)$ doublet under electric-magnetic duality. This provides a non-trivial consistency check on our formulation. For the specific case of two-body scattering, we obtain resummed expressions for the waveforms in both the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Cosmological tensions in Proca-Nuevo theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmological predictions of (extended) Proca-Nuevo theory. This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at $1.5\sigma$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\sigma$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8\sigma$ to $2.3\sigma$ (resp. $1.5\sigma$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.</description>

      <title>Weak gravity at micron scales from dark bubble cosmology and its cosmological consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark bubble model makes a positive cosmological constant natural in string theory, and predicts several new physical phenomena within reach in the near future. In this paper we study the experimental consequences of the model for the strength of gravity at scales of order $10^{-5}$m. Contrary to other models of gravity involving extra dimensions, the dark bubble model predicts gravity to become weaker rather than stronger at small scales, compared to Newtonian gravity. In particular, we provide explicit predictions of measurable deviations using table top experiments. We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\Omega_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and $P$-$V$ Criticality of Charged AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extended phase-space thermodynamics and $P$--$V$ criticality of electrically charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes in Kalb--Ramond bumblebee gravity in the presence of a spherically symmetric cloud of strings. The background Kalb--Ramond field induces Lorentz symmetry violation through a dimensionless parameter $\ell$, while the string cloud is characterized by a parameter $\alpha$, both entering the lapse function and deforming the geometry. Interpreting the ADM mass as enthalpy, we derive the main thermodynamic quantities, Hawking temperature, entropy, thermodynamic volume, Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and specific heat, and analyze how $(\ell,\alpha)$ jointly affect stability and phase structure. We obtain a Van der Waals--type equation of state, compute the critical point $(P_c,T_c,v_c)$, and show that, although the critical scales depend nontrivially on $\ell$ and $\alpha$, the universal ratio $P_c v_c/T_c = 3/8$ is preserved. Using the thermodynamic topology approach, we determine that the total topological charge of the black hole solution remains $W=1$, placing it in the same topological class as the Reissner--Nordstr\"om--AdS black hole. Finally, by studying the Joule--Thomson expansion, we derive the inversion curve and find that the minimal inversion temperature satisfies $T_i^{\rm min}/T_c = 1/2$, as in the Reissner--Nordstr\"om--AdS case, indicating that Lorentz violation and the string cloud deform the thermodynamic scales without changing the underlying universality class.</description>

      <title>Notes on Fourier transform and its application to three-point momentum-space integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier transform of two-point momentum-space Feynman integrals with massless propagators and two off-shell legs can be used to prove identities between their periods, exemplified by the glue-and-cut identity. We generalize this framework to massless momentum-space Feynman integrals with three off-shell legs and obtain a similar family of identities that can be used to calculate these integrals, especially for a non-planar subset of them, which naturally arise in the off-shell Sudakov form factors.</description>

      <title>Zoo of flows in a 3d gauged supergravity with periodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct solutions with AdS/dS asymptotics for $D=3$ truncated gauged supergravity with a periodic scalar potential. In a holographic perspective assuming Dirichlet boundary conditions, the solutions can be interpreted as deformations of 2d dual CFTs triggered by non-zero vacuum expectation values of irrelevant operators. In addition to the domain wall type solutions, we incorporated in the analysis a black string solution, which can be also interpreted as a deformation by VEV of an irrelevant operator. Generalizing the flows to finite temperature we find that the corresponding geometries are singular but have horizons. For certain flows we provide an analytical description near the horizon region.</description>

      <title>Gauge theories from scattering amplitudes with minimal assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the emergence of a Yang-Mills symmetry in theories with massless spin 1 particles from fundamental physical properties of scattering amplitudes. In the standard proofs, some symmetry and reality properties of the coupling constants in three-point amplitudes are assumed. These properties cannot be justified using only three-point amplitudes but we show that they arise as consequences of the consistent factorization of four-particle amplitudes, for particular choices of the particle basis. This applies to self-interactions of massless spin 1 particles and also to their interactions with spin 0 and 1/2 particles. CP invariance is a derived property, not an additional assumption. The situation for gravity interactions is analogous and it is dealt with in the same fashion.</description>

      <title>Heterotic Black Holes in Duality-Invariant Formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effective theory of heterotic strings in two spacetime dimensions, in a double field theory-inspired formalism, manifestly consistent with $T$-duality in string theory. Restricting the gauge group to a single $\mathrm{U}(1)$, we study the charged black hole solution and perform a precise analysis of the properties of the dual geometry with the $\mathrm{O}(1,2; \mathbb{R})$-valued generalized metric. We comment on some aspects related to singularities and gauge dependence. We show that the classification program for higher derivative corrections can also be applied to the heterotic case. We further elucidate how a previously proposed solution to the equations of motion, parametrized in a manner fully non-perturbative in $\alpha'$, can be extended to the scenario with $r$ abelian fields and the corresponding $\mathrm{O}(1,1+r; \mathbb{R})$ symmetry. We discuss some novel features of the solution for charged black holes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Properties of the Proton from a Deformed AdS Holographic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational form factors of the proton and some of its mechanical properties. We use a holographic model based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, in which a deformation in the anti-de Sitter background geometry is considered. By describing the proton as a Dirac field in this background, we numerically evaluate the gloun contribution of its gravitational form factors $A$ and $C$ from its energy-momentum tensor. A comparison of our numerical results with respect to some lattice QCD results and previous results in holography is made. In general, a good agreement is found. We also evaluate the term $D$ and make use of it to compute the pressure and shear distributions in the system, which result in a stable composed particle interpretation consistent with the von Laue stability condition. The energy distribution in the system is also obtained. Internal forces are investigated to support this picture. We are also able to compute the radii associated with these distributions in the proton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</description>

      <title>Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 2. Constraints on Dark Energy, Spatial Curvature, and Neutrino Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out an independent re-analysis of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) public dataset, focusing on extensions to the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$), spatial curvature ($o\Lambda$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\approx30\%$ and $\approx20\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_\nu&lt;0.32\,{\rm eV}$, with the $30\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\%$ improvement assuming the $\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$ model (yielding $M_\nu&lt;0.059\,{\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_\nu&lt;0.097\,{\rm eV}$ in $o\Lambda$CDM+$M_\nu$ and $M_\nu&lt;0.13\,{\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_\nu$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherent dynamics of quasiclassical spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a wide range of quantum gravity theories, quasiclassical geometries, which are solutions to the Einstein field equations approximately, are described by "coherent states." Here we propose a Hamiltonian formalism for gravitational dynamics with respect to this coherent state basis, which generates time evolution of the spacetime with respect to a clock at infinity. Since the coherent states are not orthogonal, an initial quasiclassical geometry is dynamically driven into a superposition of different amplitudes. Our framework provides a dynamical mechanism for tunneling between geometries that is ubiquitous in a number of approaches to quantum gravity, from loop quantum gravity to the Euclidean path integral. We apply our framework to the problem of black hole evaporation, providing a hint at how unitarity may be preserved with the inclusion of quantum corrections to the semiclassical evolution of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Multi-Field Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic continuous matrix product states (RCMPS) are a powerful variational ansatz for quantum field theories of a single field. However, they inherit a property of their non-relativistic counterpart that makes them divergent for models with multiple fields, unless a regularity condition is satisfied. This has so far restricted the use of RCMPS to toy models with a single self-interacting field. We address this long standing problem by introducing a Riemannian optimization framework, that allows to minimize the energy density over the regular submanifold of multi-field RCMPS, and thus to retain purely variational results. We demonstrate its power on a model of two interacting scalar fields in $1+1$ dimensions. The method captures distinct symmetry-breaking phases, and the signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition along an $O(2)$-symmetric parameter line. This makes RCMPS usable for a far larger class of problems than before.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotics of the $6j$-symbols for the principal series of the modular double of $\mathrm U_q\mathfrak{sl}(2;\mathbb R)$, and of their analytic extension -- what we call the $b$-$6j$ symbols, relating them in various cases to the volume of truncated hyperideal tetrahedra in the hyperbolic and the anti-de Sitter geometry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the anti-de Sitter geometry appears in the asymptotics of quantum invariants. In addition, based on the connection to conformal field theory, we reveal a correspondence between the edge lengths and the dihedral angles of truncated hyperideal anti-de Sitter tetrahedra and the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates of hyperbolic four-holed spheres. We also provide a concrete instance of $3D/2D$ holography, in the spirit of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

Abstract: We employ the derivative expansion of the nonperturbative renormalization group to address the phenomenon of anisotropic scale invariance and the associated functional fixed points, also known as Lifshitz points, in systems characterized by a scalar order parameter. We demonstrate the existence of the Lifshitz fixed point featuring a non-classical value of the anisotropy exponent $\theta&lt;1/2$ and provide estimates for values of a set of critical exponents in the physically most relevant case of the three-dimensional uniaxial Lifshitz point $(d,m)=(3,1)$, $m$ denoting the anisotropy index. We compare our predictions with existing estimates from perturbative expansions around dimensionality $d=4+\frac{1}{2}$ as well as those from the $1/N$ expansion.</description>

      <title>Wormholes as perturbations of near-horizon black hole geometries: no-go theorems within effective field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reformulate the construction of wormhole solutions as perturbations around near-horizon geometries of near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes in four dimensions and equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry black holes in five dimensions. When the negative Casimir energy is taken as the source, this framework reduces to the Maldacena-Milekhin-Popov construction for magnetically charged wormholes. We then show that, in contrast, such perturbative constructions cannot be realized within the effective field theory approach to higher-derivative corrections. Remarkably, this conclusion holds irrespective of the specific form of the correction terms. The key observation is that the enhanced symmetries in the near-horizon region severely constrain the effective energy-momentum tensor near the throat. This prevents the formation of the traversable throat structure. Our analysis therefore establishes no-go theorems: traversable wormholes cannot arise perturbatively from Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m or Myers-Perry black holes in an effective field theory approach. Their realization would require either new ingredients, such as Casimir energy, or black holes with reduced symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zitterbewegung (ZBW), the trembling motion predicted by the Dirac equation, has long remained unobservable in free electrons due to its sub-Compton scale. We elaborately construct a relativistic vortex electron wave packet as a coherent superposition of both positive- and negative-energy Dirac states and derive their space-time dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that introducing orbital angular momentum provides a mechanism for amplifying the ZBW amplitude far beyond that of conventional Gaussian packets, while maintaining coherence. The resulting relativistic vortex states unify Gaussian and Bessel-Gaussian models within a single framework and opens new possibilities for observing relativistic quantum dynamics in structured electron wave packets.</description>

Abstract: We explore the possibility to use the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator as an order parameter of the deconfinement phase transition in gauge-matter systems at finite temperature. Concretely, we compute by numerical simulations this operator in the (2+1)-dimensional Z(2) lattice gauge theory (LGT) with Z(2) gauge fields coupled to Z(2)-valued Higgs fields. Our conclusion is that the Fredenhagen-Marcu operator can indeed serve as an order parameter capable of distinguishing the deconfinement phase from the Higgs and confinement phases of the theory.</description>

We argue that it may have new type of monopoles, in particular the neutral monopole (``the Z monopole") which is electromagnetically neutral but has the neutral magnetic charge $4\pi/\be$, where $\be$ is the neutral charge. The mass of the new monopole could be less than the Cho-Maison monopole, around 3.28 TeV. We show how to construct the neutral monopole and clarify the origin of the topology of the new monopole. We discuss the implications of the new monopoles in physics.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple CFT/TFT correspondence I: General setup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the TFT construction of CFT correlators of [arXiv:hep-th/0204148] to so-called finite logarithmic CFTs for which the algebraic input data is no longer semisimple but still finite. More specifically, starting from the data of a chiral CFT given in the form of a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C we use a three dimensional topological field theory with surface defects based on the surgery TFT of [arXiv:1912.02063] to construct a full CFT as a braided monoidal oplax natural transformation.
  We make our construction explicit in the example of the transparent surface defect, resulting in the so-called Cardy case. In particular, we consider topological line defects and their action on bulk fields in these logarithmic CFTs, providing a source of examples for non-invertible and non-semisimple topological symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider configurations of lines in 3-space with incidences prescribed by a graph. This defines a subvariety in a product of Grassmannians. Leveraging a connection with rigidity theory in the plane, for any graph, we determine the dimension of the incidence variety and characterize when it is irreducible or a complete intersection. We study its multidegree and the family of Schubert problems it encodes. Our spanning-tree coordinates enable efficient symbolic computations. We also provide numerical irreducible decompositions for incidence varieties with up to eight lines. These constructions with lines play a key role in the Landau analysis of scattering amplitudes in particle physics.</description>

      <title>Friction in Stochastic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve time-reversed stochastic inflation in the semi-infinite flat potential with a constant drift term and derive an exact expression for the probability distribution of the curvature fluctuations. It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.</description>

      <title>Analytic First-Order Entanglement Entropy of Schwarzschild Black Holes with Interacting Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the first-order correction to the entanglement entropy of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction across the horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. The key result is a fully explicit analytic expression for both the renormalized Newton constant and the corresponding correction to the entropy. Using the Euclidean action, the replica trick, and heat-kernel methods, we obtain a closed-form expression that depends directly on the horizon area, the scalar mass, the interaction strength, and the curvature coupling. The correction exhibits a characteristic logarithmically enhanced quadratic divergence, which is absorbed into the renormalized gravitational coupling. Once this renormalization is performed, the entropy takes the standard Bekenstein-Hawking form with a finite, physically meaningful value. Our result makes it possible to study in detail how the correction varies with model parameters: light fields and strong interactions increase the effect, curvature suppresses it, and conformally coupled fields show no leading-order contribution. Overall, this work provides a clear analytic demonstration of how quantum field interactions modify black hole entropy through the renormalization of Newton's constant.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of the Extended Uncertainty Principle: Energy Conditions, Stability, and Late Time Acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological consequences of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) by deriving modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamic arguments. The evolution of the effective equation of state induced by EUP corrections is analyzed and characterized using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. We then examine the fulfillment of classical energy conditions, including the null, weak, strong, and dominant conditions. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of the model is investigated, showing that the EUP cosmology admits a late-time de Sitter attractor. Finally, we evaluate the effective speed of sound associated with the model and discuss implications for perturbative stability. Our findings indicate that EUP-induced corrections can produce a consistent late-time acceleration without requiring a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Factorisation conditions and causality for local measurements in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such "impossible measurements", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose physical implementation arises from a fully relativistically covariant interaction, between the quantum field and a suitable probe, should be regarded as admissible. While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in "impossible measurement" scenarios. Finally, we show that the accuracy with which local field observables can be measured is fundamentally limited by the retarded propagator of the field, which also plays an essential role in a factorisation identity we prove for the field Kraus operators.</description>

      <title>Point-like non-commutative families of bounding cochains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define genus zero open Gromov-Witten invariants with boundary and interior constraints for a Lagrangian submanifold of arbitrary even dimension. The definition relies on constructing a canonical family of bounding cochains that satisfy the point-like condition of the second author and Tukachinsky. Since the Lagrangian is even dimensional, the parameter of the family is odd. Thus, to avoid the vanishing of invariants with more than one boundary constraint, the parameter must be non-commutative. The invariants are defined either when the Lagrangian is a rational cohomology sphere or when the Lagrangian is fixed by an anti-symplectic involution, has dimension $2$ modulo $4$, and its cohomology is that of a sphere aside from degree $1$ modulo $4$. In dimension $2$, these invariants recover Welschinger's invariants.
  We develop an obstruction theory for the existence and uniqueness of bounding cochains in a Fukaya $A_\infty$ algebra with non-commutative coefficients. The obstruction classes belong to twisted cohomology groups of the Lagrangian instead of the de Rham cohomology of the commutative setting. A spectral sequence is constructed to compute the twisted cohomology groups. The extension of scalars of an $A_\infty$ algebra by a non-commutative ring is treated in detail. A theory of pseudo-completeness is introduced to guarantee the convergence of the Maurer-Cartan equation, which defines bounding cochains, even though the non-commutative parameter is given zero filtration.</description>

      <title>Holographically Emergent Gauge Theory in Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\,{=}\,\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\,{\leq}\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\#}\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information. For $N&gt;4$, measurements generically generate an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered Coulomb phase with gapless photons and purification time $t_{\#}\sim \mathcal{O}(L)$.</description>

Abstract: This review paper uses renormalization group techniques for signal detection in nearly-continuous positive spectra. We highlight universal aspects of the analogue field-theory approach. The first aim is to present an extended self-consistent construction of the analogue effective field-theory framework for data, which can be viewed as a maximum entropy model. In particular and exploiting universality arguments, we justify the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry of the classical action and we stress the existence of a large-scale (local) regime and of a small-scale (nonlocal) regime. Secondly and related to noise models, we observe the universal relation between phase transition and symmetry breaking in the vicinity of the detection threshold. Finally, we discuss the issue of defining the covariance matrix for tensorial-like data. Based on the cutting graph prescription, we note the superiority of definitions based on complete graphs of large size for data analysis.</description>

      <title>Topics in Weyl Geometry and Quantum Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first part of this thesis focuses on the Weyl-covariant nature of holography. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham ambient construction for conformal geometry to a corresponding construction for Weyl geometry. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we investigate Weyl-covariant quantities on the Weyl manifold and define Weyl-obstruction tensors. We show that Weyl-obstruction tensors appear as poles in the Fefferman-Graham expansion of the AlAdS bulk metric for even boundary dimensions. Under holographic renormalization in the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham gauge, we compute the Weyl anomaly of the boundary theory in multiple dimensions and demonstrate that Weyl-obstruction tensors can be used as the building blocks for the Weyl anomaly of the dual quantum field theory. The holographic calculation with a background Weyl geometry also suggests an underlying geometric interpretation of the Weyl anomaly.
  The second part of this thesis is devoted to understanding the geometric nature of the BRST formalism and quantum anomalies. Using the language of Lie algebroids, the BRST complex can be encoded in the exterior algebra of an Atiyah Lie algebroid derived from the principal bundle of the gauge theory. We showed that the cohomology of an Atiyah Lie algebroid in a trivialization gives rise to the BRST cohomology. We then apply the Lie algebroid cohomology in studying quantum anomalies and demonstrate the computation for chiral and Lorentz-Weyl anomalies. In particular, we pay close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie algebroid (which was absent in the traditional BRST complex) provides hints of a deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the canonical quantization of a massive scalar field on a five dimensional, rotating black hole space-time. We focus on the case where the space-time is asymptotically anti-de Sitter and the black hole's two angular momentum parameters are equal. In this situation the geometry possesses additional symmetries which simplify both the mode solutions of the scalar field equation and the stress-energy tensor. When the angular momentum of the black hole is sufficiently small that there is no speed-of-light surface, there exists a Killing vector which is time-like in the region exterior to the event horizon. In this case classical superradiance is absent and we construct analogues of the usual Boulware and Hartle-Hawking quantum states for the quantum scalar field. We compute the differences in expectation values of the square of the quantum scalar field operator and the stress-energy tensor operator between these two quantum states.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the question of conformal boundary conditions in the compact free boson CFT in two dimensions. Besides the well-known Neumann and Dirichlet cases, there is an additional proposed one-parameter family of boundary states when the radius is an irrational multiple of the self-dual radius. These additional states have a continuous open string spectrum and we give an explicit formula for the density of states. We also discuss several pathologies of these states, including a violation of the cluster condition and that they have a divergent g-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism, we discuss the off-shell nilpotent (anti-)BRST and the bosonic ghost-scale symmetries of a set of coupled (but equivalent) Lagrangian densities for the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) combined field-theoretic system of the free Abelian 3-form and 1-form gauge theories. We demonstrate that the Noether (anti-)BRST charges are non-nilpotent due to the presence of a set of non-trivial Curci-Ferrari (CF) type restrictions on our theory. These CF-type restrictions are derived and discussed from different theoretical angles in our present endeavor. In addition to it, we obtain the nilpotent versions of the above (anti-)BRST charges from their counterparts non-nilpotent versions and discuss the physicality criteria w.r.t. the nilpotent charges to show that the physical states (existing in the total quantum Hilbert space of states) are those that are annihilated by the operator forms of the first-class constraints of our classical 4D combined field-theoretic system. The standard BRST algebra among the nilpotent (anti-)BRST charges and the bosonic ghost charge is derived, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of a topological phase in a topological many-body system can be distinguished through the analysis of topological invariants. In the present study, the topological invariants for the strongly coupled holographic semimetals have been systematically computed, especially focusing on the holographic Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetal. The topological invariants that we calculate include the Weyl charge, the topological charges for a nodal ring $\zeta_0$, $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$ and an additional mirror symmetry protected topological invariant, $\widetilde{\zeta}_{2}$, that we herein introduce. In addition, the effective band structures and topological invariants in the critical phases of holographic semimetals are investigated, including the case of Weyl, nodal line and Weyl-Nodal line coexisting semimetals. The findings indicate the presence of notable and unique features inherent to strongly coupled topological semimetals, including band-crossing ordering interchange and multi Fermi surfaces, which provide a valuable platform for experimental investigations of strongly coupled semimetals in condensed matter physics.</description>

Abstract: Supersymmetric models in singular extra dimensional spaces feature prominently in many interesting phenomenological models, including those derived from string theory. In this paper we explicitly derive the low energy theory of phenomenologically viable supersymmetric theories in five dimensions, and highlight several aspects of these models that are not obvious from working solely in the 4d effective theory. Important deviations arise for anomaly mediation, which is purported to be a predictive mechanism to mediate supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking that is naturally most relevant in extra dimensional theories. Despite this, most analyses of anomaly mediation have been performed in the 4d effective theory. We fill this gap in the literature by constructing stabilized supersymmetric theories in 5d and studying supersymmetry breaking and anomaly mediation. Studying Sequestered Conformal Anomaly-Mediated (SCAM) in full generality reveals important deviations from the 4d EFT expectations, particularly for the role of boundary superpotentials, the radion and the predicted universality of anomaly mediation. We discuss the requirements for viable extra dimensional models of SUSY-breaking, and demonstrate when and how the anomaly-mediated masses in 5d reduce to the na{\i}ve 4d supersymmetric result. In many cases supersymmetry is necessarily broken at the 5d level, leading to anomaly-mediated and other supersymmetry breaking masses that are not derivable in a simple supersymmetric 4d EFT, but need to be included as matching corrections. We comment on the potential implications of our methods for phenomenology and singular higher-dimensional constructions, such as the KKLT scenario.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections to Thermodynamics of Accelerating Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behaviour at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that two elementary worldline path integrals-the thermal partition function of the harmonic oscillator and the one-loop effective action of scalar QED in a constant field strength-exhibit a natural form of supersymmetric localization. The mechanism relies on hidden fermionic symmetries of the worldline BRST formulation, rather than on standard BRST structure or physical supersymmetry. These symmetries localize the target-space trajectory. For the harmonic oscillator this yields an alternative localization derivation of the Jacobi-Poisson formula. Moreover, after the trajectory is localized, the remaining proper-time integral exhibits an emergent zero-dimensional supersymmetry generated by modular invariance, allowing the modulus T itself to be localized. For scalar QED the same structure provides a controlled computation of both the real and imaginary parts of the Euler-Heisenberg effective action. In particular, the imaginary part arises from a moduli space of circular worldline instantons, offering a localization perspective on the semiclassical exactness of the Schwinger pair-production result observed by Affleck-Alvarez-Manton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the phase space of the Maxwell field as a simplified framework to study the quantisation of holonomies (Wilson line operators) on lightlike (null) surfaces. Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>

Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. However, unless the integrated additional term \chi=(g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4xL(x) is not zero, these modified relations are not compatible with gauge invariance. The additional term \chi is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term \chi is largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time (\tau). The bosonic definition of the topological charge Q_t and its Abelian counterpart Q_a written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When \chi is zero, Q_a=3Q_t is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of Q_a is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when Q_t is stabilized around -1.</description>

      <title>Alternative Framework to Quantize Fermionic Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational framework is developed here to quantize fermionic fields based on the extended stationary action principle. From the first principle, we successfully derive the well-known Floreanini-Jackiw representation of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the wave functional of fermionic fields - an equation typically introduced as a postulate in standard canonical quantization. The derivation is accomplished through three key contributions. At the conceptual level, the classical stationary action principle is augmented to include a correction term based on the relative entropy arising from field fluctuations. Then, an extended canonical transformation for fermionic fields is formulated that leads to the quantum version of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a form consistent with the Floreanini-Jackiw representation; Third, necessary functional calculus with Grassmann-valued field variables is developed for the variation procedure. The quantized Hamiltonian can generate the Poincar\'{e} algebra, thus satisfying the symmetry requirements of special relativity. Concrete calculation of the probability of particle creation for the fermionic field under the influence of constant external field confirms that the results agree with those using standard canonical quantization. We also show that the framework can be applied to develop theories of interaction between fermionic fields and other external fields such as electromagnetic fields, non-Abelian gauge fields, or another fermionic field. These results further establish that the present variational framework is a novel alternative to derive quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Complexity transitions in chaotic quantum systems: Nonstabilizerness, entanglement, and fractal dimension in SYK and random matrix models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum systems -- composed of many, interacting particles -- are intrinsically difficult to model. When a quantum many-body system is subject to disorder, it can undergo transitions to regimes with varying non-ergodic and localized behavior, which can significantly reduce the number of relevant basis states. It remains an open question whether such transitions are also directly related to an abrupt change in the system's complexity. In this work, we study the transition from chaotic to integrable phases in several paradigmatic models, the power-law random banded matrix model, the Rosenzweig--Porter model, and a hybrid SYK+Ising model, comparing three complementary complexity markers -- fractal dimension, von Neumann entanglement entropy, and stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. For all three markers, finite-size scaling reveals sharp transitions between high- and low-complexity regimes, which, however, can occur at different critical points. As a consequence, while in the ergodic and localized regimes the markers align, they diverge significantly in the presence of an intermediate fractal phase. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy is more sensitive to underlying many-body symmetries, such as fermion parity and time reversal, than the other markers. As our results show, different markers capture complementary facets of complexity, making it necessary to combine them to obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of phase transitions. The divergence between different complexity markers also has significant consequences for the classical simulability of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>Qumode Tensor Networks for False Vacuum Decay in Quantum Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay in scalar quantum field theory (QFT) is a cornerstone of early Universe cosmology and high energy physics, yet its real-time dynamics is essentially inaccessible to classical computation due to its non-perturbative, highly entangled dynamics. We introduce a general Hamiltonian framework for simulating full interacting QFTs, using a spatial lattice of continuos-variable ``qumodes'' -- bosonic local oscillators whose high-dimensional local Hilbert space faithfully captures interacting field dynamics. This construction is rooted in continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC), and provides a unified platform spanning efficient classical tensor-network methods and emerging photonic quantum hardware. The first key advance of this work is a robust and scaleable method for preparing the QFT in its correct initial vacuum state. We develop an imaginary-time preparation algorithm tailored to qumode lattices, that efficiently projects onto the vacuum even in strongly coupled regimes. This provides a controllable starting point for studying nonperturbative dynamics such as tunnelling and real-time decay. Building on this, we use a time-evolving block decimation algorithm to capture the real-time dynamics of the scalar field. Our second key advance is the identification and excitation of the negative fluctuation mode of the bounce configuration on the qumode lattice. A small displacement along this mode produces the expected tachyonic growth, driving fully coherent bubble nucleation without requiring classically supercritical seeds. This demonstrates that the qumode lattice captures non-perturbative quantum dynamics that lie beyond the classical treatments. Our results establish the qumode network as a scalable framework for non-equilibrium scalar QFT phenomena and pave the way for higher-dimensional studies and continuous-variable quantum computing implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the Collins azimuthal asymmetries for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions. To this aim, we employ a recent extraction of the transversity and Collins fragmentation functions from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs processes, obtained within a simplified transverse momentum dependent (TMD) approach at leading order in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. In the present case we adopt a collinear configuration for the initial state, keeping transverse momentum effects only in the fragmentation mechanism. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200~GeV and 510~GeV data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the distributions in the transverse momentum of the jet, the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction. While not being a proof, due the assumptions and limitations behind the entire approach, these findings corroborate the hypothesis of TMD factorization for such processes as well as of the universality of the Collins function and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries.
  We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.</description>

      <title>Tsunami Solitons Emerging from Superconducting Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a classical integrable system exhibiting tsunami-like solitons with a rocky-desert-like disordered stationary background. One of the Lax operators describing this system is interpretable as a Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in parity-mixed superconductors. The family of integrable equations is generated from this seed operator using Krichever's method, whose pure $s$-wave limit includes the coupled Schr\"odinger--Boussinesq hierarchy applied to plasma physics. A linearly unstable finite background with a superconducting gap supports the tsunami-soliton solution, where the propagation of the step structure turns back at a certain moment, accompanied with the oscillation on the opposite side. In addition, the equation allows inhomogeneous stationary solutions with an arbitrary number of bumps at arbitrary positions, which we term \textit{the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) rocks}. In the Zakharov--Shabat scheme, the tsunami solitons are created from the Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the energy gap and the KdV rocks from normal electrons/holes. The unexpected large space of stationary solutions originates from the non-coprime Lax pair and the multivalued Baker--Akhiezer functions on the Riemann surface, formulated in terms of higher-rank holomorphic bundles by Krichever and Novikov. Furthermore, the concept of \textit{isodispersive phases} is introduced to characterize quasiperiodic multi-tsunami backgrounds and consider their classification.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that geodesic instabilities, characterized by the Lyapunov exponent, appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we derive the effective theory for a stabilized five-dimensional warped geometry, addressing several outstanding issues in this derivation. These include allowing for a non-zero 4d cosmological constant, accounting for constraints from both the UV and IR branes, and determining how the stabilized theory responds to an energy perturbation on each brane. We show how a consistent low-energy effective theory from a stable warped solution must respect a constraint that follows from the higher-dimensional Einstein equation. Satisfying the constraint requires that the 4d cosmological constant must be the same everywhere throughout the bulk, which means the stabilizing fields must adjust to allow for the same 4d curvature everywhere in the extra dimension. We show explicitly how this works in a 5d model, and how the correct 4d effective potential reproduces this behavior. We find that the cosmological constant generated from adding energy to one of the branes is unaffected by the details of the stabilization mechanism at leading order, despite the need for the stabilizing fields to adjust. In anticipation of a companion paper, we also briefly discuss how supersymmetry can be realized consistently in the 5d theory. In particular, we show how the stabilization mechanism remains consistent with sequestering, even as the supersymmetry-breaking energy is reflected in the stabilizing field throughout the bulk.</description>

Abstract: The thermal plasma induces a plasmon-like mass shift for gravitational perturbations, which can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early radiation-dominated universe. However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.</description>
