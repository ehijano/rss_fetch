      <title>Applications of Computational Topology to Fusion Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three novel applications of computational topology in the field of fusion science are developed. A procedure for the automatic classification of the orbits of magnetic field lines into topologically distinct classes using Vietoris-Rips persistent homology is presented and tested for a toy model of a perturbed tokamak. A method for estimating the distribution of the size of islands in the phase space of a Hamiltonian system or area-preserving map by sub-level set persistent homology is explored. This method is used to analyse the case of an accelerator mode island in the phase space of Chirikov's standard map and the possibility of detecting the self-similar island hierarchy responsible for anomalous transport in this model is investigated. Finally, it is suggested that TDA provides a toolset for the detection and characterisation of renormalisation group transformations which leave structures in Hamiltonian phase spaces invariant. The specific example of detecting the transform which leaves the neighborhood of a hyperbolic fixed point of the perturbed pendulum invariant is investigated using two different TDA approaches. Both of which are found to be partially sensitive to the symmetry in question but only weakly.</description>

      <title>Electron-ion model of ball and bead lightning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the electron-ion model, parameters of ball and bead lightning are calculated. The model allows us to estimate maximum size of ball lightning, its energy content, electric charge and magnetic field, to determine equilibrium conditions between positively charged ions located inside and outer shell containing rapidly moving electrons. An explanation is given to the fact that shells are observed inside ball lightning that differ from each other in color of glow. The model describes structure of not only ball lightning, but also bead lightning. The long-term stability of bead lightning is associated with the balance of neighboring beads under action of magnetic force of their attraction and electric force of repulsion, which exceed in magnitude the force of wind pressure.</description>

      <title>A Particle-In-Cell Method for Plasmas with a Generalized Momentum Formulation, Part III: A Family of Gauge Conserving Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new family of spatially co-located field solvers for particle-in-cell applications which evolve the potential formulation of Maxwell's equations under the Lorenz gauge. Our recent work introduced the concept of time-consistency, which connects charge conservation to the preservation of the gauge at the semi-discrete level. It will be shown that there exists a large family of time discretizations which satisfy this property. Additionally, it will be further shown that for large classes of time marching methods, the satisfaction of the gauge condition automatically implies the satisfaction of Gauss's law for electricity, with the potential formulation ensuring that that Gauss's law for magnetism is satisfied by definition. We focus on popular time marching methods including centered differences, backward differences, and diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta methods, which are coupled to a spectral discretization in space. We demonstrate the theory by testing the methods on a relativistic Weibel instability and a drifting cloud of electrons.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamics of a spin-polarized electron plasma with magnetic ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a mean-field model that describes the nonlinear dynamics of a spin-polarized electron gas interacting with fixed, positively-charged ions possessing a magnetic moment that evolves in time. The mobile electrons are modeled by a four-component distribution function in the two-dimensional phase space $(x,v)$, obeying a Vlasov-Poisson set of equations. The ions are modeled by a Landau-Lifshitz equation for their spin density, which contains ion-ion and electron-ion magnetic exchange terms. We perform a linear response study of the coupled Vlasov-Poisson-Landau-Lifshitz (VPLL) equations for the case of a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium, focussing in particular on the spin dispersion relation. Condition of stability or instability for the spin modes are identified, which depend essentially on the electron spin polarization rate $\eta$ and the electron-ion magnetic coupling constant $K$. We also develop an Eulerian grid-based computational code for the fully nonlinear VPLL equations, based on the geometric Hamiltonian method first developed in [N. Crouseilles et al. Journal of Plasma Physics, 89(2):905890215, 2023]. This technique allows us to achieve great accuracy for the conserved quantities, such as the modulus of the ion spin vector and the total energy. Numerical tests in the linear regime are in accordance with the estimations of the linear response theory. For two-stream equilibria, we study the interplay of instabilities occurring in both the charge and the spin sectors. The set of parameters used in the simulations, with densities close to those of solids ($\approx 10^{29} \rm m^{-3}$) and temperatures of the order of 10 eV, may be relevant to the warm dense matter regime appearing in some inertial fusion experiments.</description>

      <title>CH(A) Radical Formation in Coulomb Explosion from Butane Seeded Plasma Generated with Chirp-Controlled Ultrashort Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally studied the formation of CH(A) radicals in butane seeded plasma generated with chirp-controlled ultrashort laser pulses (\(\sim 760 \, \mu \text{J}/\text{pulse}\), 890 nm, 1 kHz, 8 fs). The focused beam with high peak intensity (\(\sim 10^{14} - 10^{16} \, \text{W/cm}^2\)) caused Coulomb explosion (CE). The time dependent emission spectra were observed with the Fourier-transform Visible spectroscopy (FTVis) step-scan method. The average signal intensity decreased with the chirp in the Ar\(^+\) &gt; C\(_2\) &gt; H-\(\alpha\) \(\sim\) CH(A) order with a plateau for CH(A) in the \(-200\) to \(-100 \, \text{fs}^2\) range. The short rise time of the CH(A) emission signal, the monoexponential emission decay, and the nearly constant rotational and vibrational temperatures of the CH(A) radicals (\(\sim 3000 \, \text{K}\) and \(\sim 3800 \, \text{K}\)) all support their formation as a primary product. Our TDDFT calculations predict that CH and many other fragments can be formed beyond CE at \(\sim 7 \times 10^{14} \, \text{W/cm}^2\) intensity. The average charge of CH (+0.6) and its relative abundance (0.5\%) support the formation of detectable CH(A) within 120 fs.</description>

      <title>Global Stellarator Coil Optimization with Quadratic Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08267v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most present stellarator designs are produced by costly two-stage optimization: the first for an optimized equilibrium, and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. Few proxies for coil complexity and forces exist at the equilibrium stage. Rapid initial state finding for both stages is a topic of active research. Most present convex coil optimization codes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with recent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics objectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of linear functions in coil current. We present QUADCOIL, a fast, global coil optimization method that targets combinations of linear and quadratic functions of the current. It can directly constrain and/or minimize a wide range of physics objectives unavailable in NESCOIL and REGCOIL, including the Lorentz force, magnetic energy, curvature, field-current alignment, and the maximum density of a dipole array. QUADCOIL requires no initial guess and runs nearly $10^2\times$ faster than filament optimization. Integrating it in the equilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with difficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation time per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large parameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing approximate global minimum. It supports most regularization techniques developed for NESCOIL and REGCOIL. We demonstrate QUADCOIL's effectiveness in coil topology control, minimizing non-convex penalties, and predicting filament coil complexity with three numerical examples.</description>
