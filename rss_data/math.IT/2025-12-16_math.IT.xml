      <title>Differentially Private Community Detection in $h$-uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the exact recovery threshold subject to preserving the privacy of connections in $h$-uniform hypergraphs. Privacy is characterized by the $(\epsilon, \delta)$-hyperedge differential privacy (DP), an extension of the notion of $(\epsilon, \delta)$-edge DP in the literature. The hypergraph observations are modeled through a $h$-uniform stochastic block model ($h$-HSBM) in the dense regime. We investigate three differentially private mechanisms: stability-based, sampling-based, and perturbation-based mechanisms. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for each mechanism and study the contraction of the exact recovery region due to the privacy budget, $(\epsilon, \delta)$. Sampling-based mechanisms and randomized response mechanisms guarantee pure $\epsilon$-hyperedge DP where $\delta=0$, while the stability-based mechanisms cannot achieve this level of privacy. The dependence of the limits of the privacy budget on the parameters of the $h$-uniform hypergraph is studied. More precisely, it is proven rigorously that the minimum privacy budget scales logarithmically with the ratio between the density of in-cluster hyperedges and the cross-cluster hyperedges for stability-based and Bayesian sampling-based mechanisms, while this budget depends only on the size of the hypergraph for the randomized response mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Scalable Digital Twin Deployment in Smart Campus Building Facility Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) offers significant opportunities for enhancing facility management (FM) in campus environments. However, existing research often focuses narrowly on isolated domains, such as point-cloud geometry or energy analytics, without providing a scalable and interoperable workflow that integrates building geometry, equipment metadata, and operational data into a unified FM platform. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for scalable digital-twin deployment in smart campus buildings by integrating 3D laser scanning, BIM modeling, and IoT-enabled data visualization to support facility operations and maintenance. The methodology includes: (1) reality capture using terrestrial laser scanning and structured point-cloud processing; (2) development of an enriched BIM model incorporating architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, conveying, and sensor systems; and (3) creation of a digital-twin environment that links equipment metadata, maintenance policies, and simulated IoT data within a digital-twin management platform. A case study of the Price Gilbert Building at Georgia Tech demonstrates the implementation of this workflow. A total of 509 equipment items were modeled and embedded with OmniClass classifications into the digital twin. Ten interactive dashboards were developed to visualize system performance. Results show that the proposed framework enables centralized asset documentation, improved system visibility, and enhanced preventive and reactive maintenance workflows. Although most IoT data were simulated due to limited existing sensor infrastructure, the prototype validates the feasibility of a scalable digital twin for facility management and establishes a reference model for real-time monitoring, analytics integration, and future autonomous building operations.</description>

      <title>Large and Small Model Collaboration for Air Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) have shown strong capability in wireless communications, yet existing works mainly rely on their generalized knowledge across environments while overlooking the potential gains of environment-specific adaptation. Directly fine-tuning LAMs for adaptation is often impractical due to prohibitive training costs, low inference efficiency in multi-user scenarios, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting, in addition to the limited accessibility of model parameters. To address these limitations, we establish a collaborative framework for air interface. In this framework, unlike prior approaches that either depend solely on LAMs or require direct fine-tuning, LAMs are exploited as a universal channel knowledge base while small artificial intelligence models (SAMs) are employed as lightweight plugins to capture environment-specific knowledge, facilitating efficient environment-specific adaptation of LAMs. Subsequently, we instantiate this framework for CSI feedback tasks, and develop a large and small collaboration framework for CSI feedback, referred to as LASCO. LASCO operates by letting the base LAM produce an initial CSI reconstruction, learning the environment-induced reconstruction shift through a reference SAM and a proxy SAM, and transferring this shift back to the LAM. To further enhance adaptability, we introduce elastic-LASCO (E-LASCO), which augments LASCO with learnable collaboration coefficients that control the contribution of LAMs and SAMs across different environments. Numerical results demonstrate that LASCO and E-LASCO enables LAMs to achieve environment-specific performance gains with significantly reduced training costs, lower data collection requirements, and faster adaptation speed.</description>

      <title>Hulls of Free Linear Codes over a Non-Unital Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the hull codes of free linear codes over a non-unital ring $ E= \langle \kappa,\tau \mid 2 \kappa =2 \tau=0,~ \kappa^2=\kappa,~ \tau^2=\tau,~ \kappa \tau=\kappa,~ \tau \kappa=\tau \rangle$. Initially, we examine the residue and torsion codes of various hulls of $E$-linear codes and obtain an explicit form of the generator matrix of the hull of a free $E$-linear code. Then, we propose four build-up construction methods to construct codes with a larger length and hull-rank from codes with a smaller length and hull-rank. Some illustrative examples are also given to support our build-up construction methods. Subsequently, we study the permutation equivalence of two free $E$-linear codes and discuss the hull-variation problem. As an application, we classify optimal free $E$-linear codes for lengths up to $8$.</description>

      <title>ElasticVR: Elastic Task Computing in Multi-User Multi-Connectivity Wireless Virtual Reality (VR) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse emerging VR applications integrate streaming of high fidelity 360 video content that requires ample amounts of computation and data rate. Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations.</description>

      <title>Linear Codes with Certain Dimension of Hermitian Hulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the enumerative and asymptotic properties related to Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes on the unitary space over $\F_{q^2}$. We provide some closed form expressions for the counting formulas of Hermitian $\ell$-complementary codes. There is a similarity in the asymptotic weight distribution between Hermitian self-orthogonal codes and unrestricted codes. Furthermore, we study the asymptotic behavior of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes whose minimum distance is at least $d$. In particular, we conclude that MDS codes within the class of Hermitian self-orthogonal codes are asymptotically dense when the alphabet size approaches to infinity.</description>

      <title>Vertical Heterogeneous Networks Beyond 5G: CoMP Coverage Enhancement and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks are increasingly vital for the low-altitude economy, enabling wireless coverage in high-mobility and hard-to-reach environments. However, providing reliable connectivity to sparsely distributed aerial users in dynamic three-dimensional (3D) spaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates downlink coverage enhancement in vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) beyond 5G, where uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate as emerging aerial base stations (ABSs) alongside legacy terrestrial base stations (TBSs). To improve coverage performance, we propose a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission framework that enables joint transmission from ABSs and TBSs. This approach mitigates the limitations of non-uniform user distributions and enhances reliability for sparse aerial users. Two UAV deployment strategies are considered: \textit{i)} random UAV placement, analyzed using stochastic geometry to derive closed-form coverage expressions, and \textit{ii)} optimized UAV placement using a coverage-aware weighted $K$-means clustering algorithm to maximize cooperative coverage in underserved areas. Theoretical analyses and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed CoMP-enabled VHetNet significantly improves downlink coverage probability, particularly in scenarios with sparse aerial users. These findings highlight the potential of intelligent UAV coordination and geometry-aware deployment to enable robust, adaptive connectivity in low-altitude wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Linear Binary Codes Correcting One or More Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines linear binary codes capable of correcting one or more errors. For the single-error-correcting case, it is shown that the Hamming bound is achieved by a constructive method, and an exact expression for the minimal codeword length is derived. For the general case, a simple lower bound for the parameters of linear codes is derived from an analysis of the coset structure.</description>

      <title>C-PASS: Center-Fed Pinching Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel architecture of the center-fed pinching antenna system (C-PASS) is proposed. In contrast to the conventional end-fed PASS, signals are fed from the center input ports and propagate towards both sides of the waveguide. By doing so, spatial-multiplexing gain can be achieved in a single waveguide. Based on the proposed C-PASS, closed-form expressions for the degree of freedom (DoF) and power scaling laws are derived. These theoretical results reveal that C-PASS can achieve \emph{twice} the DoF and an additional multiplexing gain of $\mathcal{O}(P_T \ln^4 N/N^2)$ compared to the conventional PASS, where $P_T$ and $N$ represent the transmit power and pinching antenna number, respectively. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that substantial capacity improvements can be achieved through the enhanced DoF and multiplexing gain of the C-PASS.</description>

      <title>From Information Freshness to Semantics of Information and Goal-oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless networks must support real-time, data-driven cyber-physical systems in which communication is tightly coupled with sensing, inference, control, and decision-making. Traditional communication paradigms centered on accuracy, throughput, and latency are increasingly inadequate for these systems, where the value of information depends on its semantic relevance to a specific task. This paper provides a unified exposition of the progression from classical distortion-based frameworks, through information freshness metrics such as the Age of Information (AoI) and its variants, to the emerging paradigm of goal-oriented semantics-aware communication. We organize and systematize existing semantics-aware metrics, including content- and version-aware measures, context-dependent distortion formulations, and history-dependent error persistence metrics that capture lasting impact and urgency. Within this framework, we highlight how these metrics address the limitations of purely accuracy- or freshness-centric designs, and how they collectively enable the selective generation and transmission of only task-relevant information. We further review analytical tools based on Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization methods that have been employed to characterize optimal or near-optimal timing and scheduling policies under semantic performance criteria and communication constraints. By synthesizing these developments into a coherent framework, the paper clarifies the design principles underlying goal-oriented, semantics-aware communication systems. It illustrates how they can significantly improve efficiency, reliability, and task performance. The presented perspective aims to serve as a bridge between information-theoretic, control-theoretic, and networking viewpoints, and to guide the design of semantic communication architectures for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication with Finite Learning Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified information-theoretic framework for artificial-intelligence (AI)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where a learning component with limited representational capacity is embedded within the transceiver loop. The study introduces the concept of an AI capacity budget to quantify how the finite ability of a learning model constrains joint communication and sensing performance. Under this framework, the paper derives both converse (upper) and achievability (lower) bounds that define the achievable rate-sensing region. For Gaussian channels, the effect of limited learning capacity is shown to behave as an equivalent additive noise, allowing simple analytical expressions for the resulting communication rate and sensing distortion. The theory is then extended to Rayleigh and Rician fading as well as to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems through new matrix inequalities and a constructive mapping between AI capacity and effective noise covariance. Resource allocation between sensing and communication is optimized under this learning constraint, yielding closed-form conditions in the Gaussian case. A general learning-information trade-off law is also established, linking the representational power of the learning module to the achievable performance frontier. Finally, a practical variational training procedure is proposed to enforce the capacity constraint and to guide empirical evaluation. The derived scaling laws provide quantitative insight for co-designing model size, waveform, and hardware in next-generation ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning discovers new champion codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear error-correcting codes form the mathematical backbone of modern digital communication and storage systems, but identifying champion linear codes (linear codes achieving or exceeding the best known minimum Hamming distance) remains challenging. By training a transformer to predict the minimum Hamming distance of a class of linear codes and pairing it with a genetic algorithm over the search space, we develop a novel method for discovering champion codes. This model effectively reduces the search space of linear codes needed to achieve champion codes. Our results present the use of this method in the study and construction of error-correcting codes, applicable to codes such as generalised toric, Reed-Muller, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, algebrogeometric, and potentially quantum codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct two new families of linear codes by modifying the generator matrices of generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes. For these codes, we explicitly derive parity-check matrices and establish necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring the MDS property. Additionally, we explore subfamilies within these constructions that are non-GRS MDS codes. We also characterize their self-orthogonal and self-dual properties and present some explicit constructions and examples.</description>

      <title>From Zipf's Law to Neural Scaling through Heaps' Law and Hilberg's Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We inspect the deductive connection between the neural scaling law and Zipf's law -- two statements discussed in machine learning and quantitative linguistics. The neural scaling law describes how the cross entropy rate of a foundation model -- such as a large language model -- changes with respect to the amount of training tokens, parameters, and compute. By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws.</description>

Abstract: This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Algorithms for Age-of-Information Cost Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in cyber-physical systems have increased the importance of maximizing the freshness of the information about the physical environment. However, optimizing the access policies of Internet of Things devices to maximize the data freshness, measured as a function of the Age-of-Information (AoI) metric, is a challenging task. This work introduces two algorithms to optimize the information update process in cyber-physical systems operating under the generate-at-will model, by finding an online policy without knowing the characteristics of the transmission delay or the age cost function. The optimization seeks to minimize the time-average cost, which integrates the AoI at the receiver and the data transmission cost, making the approach suitable for a broad range of scenarios. Both algorithms employ policy gradient methods within the framework of model-free reinforcement learning (RL) and are specifically designed to handle continuous state and action spaces. Each algorithm minimizes the cost using a distinct strategy for deciding when to send an information update. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is feasible to apply the two strategies simultaneously, leading to an additional reduction in cost. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms exhibit good convergence properties and achieve a time-average cost within 3% of the optimal value, when the latter is computable. A comparison with other state-of-the-art methods shows that the proposed algorithms outperform them in one or more of the following aspects: being applicable to a broader range of scenarios, achieving a lower time-average cost, and requiring a computational cost at least one order of magnitude lower.</description>

      <title>Bandit-Based Rate Adaptation for a Single-Server Queue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of obtaining bounded time-average expected queue sizes in a single-queue system with a partial-feedback structure. Time is slotted; in slot $t$ the transmitter chooses a rate $V(t)$ from a continuous interval. Transmission succeeds if and only if $V(t)\le C(t)$, where channel capacities $\{C(t)\}$ and arrivals are i.i.d. draws from fixed but unknown distributions. The transmitter observes only binary acknowledgments (ACK/NACK) indicating success or failure. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denote a sufficiently small lower bound on the slack between the arrival rate and the capacity region. We propose a phased algorithm that progressively refines a discretization of the uncountable infinite rate space and, without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, achieves a $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log^{3.5}(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{3}\big)$ time-average expected queue size uniformly over the horizon. We also prove a converse result showing that for any rate-selection algorithm, regardless of whether $\varepsilon$ is known, there exists an environment in which the worst-case time-average expected queue size is $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{2})$. Thus, while a gap remains in the setting without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, we show that if $\varepsilon$ is known, a simple single-stage UCB type policy with a fixed discretization of the rate space achieves $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{2}\big)$, matching the converse up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Spectral Graph Theory: Harmonic Analysis on Directed Networks via Biorthogonal Bases (Adjacency-Operator Formulation)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spectral graph theory and graph signal processing rely on a symmetry principle: undirected graphs induce symmetric (self-adjoint) adjacency/Laplacian operators, yielding orthogonal eigenbases and energy-preserving Fourier expansions. Real-world networks are typically directed and hence asymmetric, producing non-self-adjoint and frequently non-normal operators for which orthogonality fails and spectral coordinates can be ill-conditioned. In this paper we develop an original harmonic-analysis framework for directed networks centered on the \emph{adjacency} operator. We propose a \emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) built from left/right eigenvectors, formulate directed ``frequency'' and filtering in the non-Hermitian setting, and quantify how asymmetry and non-normality affect stability via condition numbers and a departure-from-normality functional. We prove exact synthesis/analysis identities under diagonalizability, establish sampling-and-reconstruction guarantees for BGFT-bandlimited signals, and derive perturbation/stability bounds that explain why naive orthogonal-GFT assumptions break down on non-normal directed graphs. A simulation protocol compares undirected versus directed cycles (asymmetry without non-normality) and a perturbed directed cycle (genuine non-normality), demonstrating that BGFT yields coherent reconstruction and filtering across asymmetric regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Homophily with Imperfect Recall: Modeling Resilience in Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate how homophily, memory constraints, and adversarial disruptions collectively shape the resilience and adaptability of complex networks. To achieve this, we develop a new framework that integrates explicit memory decay mechanisms into homophily-based models and systematically evaluate their performance across diverse graph structures and adversarial settings. Our methods involve extensive experimentation on synthetic datasets, where we vary decay functions, reconnection probabilities, and similarity measures, primarily comparing cosine similarity with traditional metrics such as Jaccard similarity and baseline edge weights. The results show that cosine similarity achieves up to a 30\% improvement in stability metrics in sparse, convex, and modular networks. Moreover, the refined value-of-recall metric demonstrates that strategic forgetting can bolster resilience by balancing network robustness and adaptability. The findings underscore the critical importance of aligning memory and similarity parameters with the structural and adversarial dynamics of the network. By quantifying the tangible benefits of incorporating memory constraints into homophily-based analyses, this study offers actionable insights for optimizing real-world applications, including social systems, collaborative platforms, and cybersecurity contexts.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-Packet-based Noise Signatures With Higher-Order Statistics for Anomaly Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note develops the first-ever noise-centric anomaly prediction method for a fused discrete-time signal. A Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) provides a time--frequency expansion in which structure and residual can be separated via orthogonal projection. Higher-Order Statistics (HOS), particularly the third-order cumulant (and its bispectral interpretation), quantify non-Gaussianity and nonlinear coupling in the extracted residual. Compact noise signatures are constructed and an analytically calibrated Mahalanobis detector yields a closed-form decision rule with non-central chi-square performance under mean-shift alternatives. Propositions and proofs establish orthonormality, energy preservation, Gaussian-null behavior of cumulants, and the resulting test statistics.</description>

      <title>Power Consumption and Energy Efficiency of Mid-Band XL-MIMO: Modeling, Scaling Laws, and Performance Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-band extra-large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO), emerging as a critical enabler for future communication systems, is expected to deliver significantly higher throughput by leveraging the extended bandwidth and enlarged antenna aperture. However, power consumption remains a significant concern due to the enlarged system dimension, underscoring the need for thorough investigations into efficient system design and deployment. To this end, an in-depth study is conducted on mid-band XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, a comprehensive power consumption model is proposed, encompassing the power consumption of major hardware components and signal processing procedures, while capturing the influence of key system parameters. Considering typical near-field propagation characteristics, closed-form approximations of throughput are derived, providing an analytical framework for assessing energy efficiency (EE). Based on the proposed framework, the scaling law of EE with respect to key system configurations is derived, offering valuable insights for system design. Subsequently, extensions and comparisons are conducted among representative multi-antenna technologies, demonstrating the superiority of mid-band XL-MIMO in EE. Extensive numerical results not only verify the tightness of the throughput analysis but also validate the EE evaluations, unveiling the potential of energy-efficient mid-band XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>Application of Deep Learning in Biological Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) has become an essential tool for capturing high-resolution biological structures. Despite its advantage in visualizations, the large storage size of Cryo-EM data file poses significant challenges for researchers and educators. This paper investigates the application of deep learning, specifically implicit neural representation (INR), to compress Cryo-EM biological data. The proposed approach first extracts the binary map of each file according to the density threshold. The density map is highly repetitive, ehich can be effectively compressed by GZIP. The neural network then trains to encode spatial density information, allowing the storage of network parameters and learnable latent vectors. To improve reconstruction accuracy, I further incorporate the positional encoding to enhance spatial representation and a weighted Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function to balance density distribution variations. Using this approach, my aim is to provide a practical and efficient biological data compression solution that can be used for educational and research purpose, while maintaining a reasonable compression ratio and reconstruction quality from file to file.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains II: tuning of group action in finite state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study group-averaged Markov chains obtained by augmenting a $\pi$-stationary transition kernel $P$ with a group action on the state space via orbit kernels. Given a group $\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\in\{G,M,B\}$. We show that $M^t, B^t \to G$ blockwise as $t \to \infty$ under suitable conditions, that the projection chains induced by $(\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$ coincide for $GPG$ and $P$, and that orbit averaging never deteriorates the absolute spectral gap or asymptotic variance when $P$ is reversible. We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = \Pi$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice. We also illustrate the results on discrete uniform and multimodal examples, including the Curie-Weiss model where $GPG$ achieves polynomial (in inverse temperature and dimension) mixing while Glauber dynamics remains exponentially slow.</description>

      <title>The maximum number of nonzero weights of linear rank-metric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the maximum number \( L_{\mathrm{rk}}(n, m, k, q) \) of distinct nonzero rank weights that an \( \mathbb{F}_{q^m} \)-linear rank-metric code of dimension \( k \) in \( \mathbb{F}_{q^m}^n \) can attain. We determine the exact value of the function \( L_{\mathrm{rk}}(n, m, k, q) \) for all admissible parameters \( n, m, k, q \). In particular, we characterize when a code achieves the full weight spectrum (FWS), i.e. when the number of distinct nonzero rank weights equals \( \min\{n, m\} \). We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of FWS codes, along with explicit constructions of codes attaining the maximum number of distinct weights. We discuss the equivalence of such codes and also present classification results for 2-dimensional codes. Finally, we investigate further properties of these optimal codes, like their behavior under duality.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Monitoring and Compensation of Transceiver IQ Imbalance by Multi-dimensional Architecture for Dual-Polarization 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a low-complexity IQ imbalance compensation architecture is proposed, which reduces the effects of in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) imbalance. The architecture consists of transceiver IQ skew estimation methods and a low-complexity MIMO equalizer structure. Before the IQ skew estimation, the chromatic dispersion(CD) is pre-compensated in the transmitter(TX) by chirp filtering. The receiver(RX) IQ skew is estimated by Gardner's phase detector, and the TX skew is estimated by finding the value that yields the lowest equalizer error. The low-complexity MIMO equalizer consists of a complex-valued MIMO(CV-MIMO) and a real-valued DD-LMS MIMO(RV-MIMO), which employ a butterfly and a non-butterfly structure, respectively. The CV-MIMO is used to perform polarization demultiplexing. The RV-MIMO equalizes each of the two polarisations and simultaneously compensates for the TX IQ imbalance. The architecture first compensates for the IQ skew at low-complexity, and the other imperfections are compensated by the low-complexity MIMO equalizer. Therefore, this architecture can equalize signals impaired by the transceiver IQ imbalance with low complexity. A 100 km transmission simulation and experiment with 36 Gbaud dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation(DP-QAM) signals and offline DSP showed that, with the RX IQ skew estimation, the number of real multiplications is reduced by more than 70% compared with conventional cases. With the low-complexity MIMO equalizer, the number of real multiplications is reduced by 51% compared with 4x4 MIMO</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the algebraic structure of double cyclic codes of length $(m, n)$ over $\mathbb{F}_4$ and we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a double cyclic code over $\mathbb{F}_4$ to be reversible. Also, we determine the algebraic structure of double cyclic codes of length $(m, n)$ over $\mathbb{F}_4+v\mathbb{F}_4$ with $v^2=v$, satisfying the reverse constraint and the reverse-complement constraint. Then we establish a one-to-one correspondence $\psi$ between the 16 DNA double pairs $S_{D_{16}} $ and the 16 elements of the finite ring $\mathbb{F}_4+v\mathbb{F}_4$. We also discuss the GC-content of DNA double cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel tomography and estimation by local test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the estimation of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. We establish a connection between the query complexities in two models: (i) access to $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) access to a random dilation of $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, we show that for parallel (possibly coherent) testers, access to dilations does not help. This is proved by constructing a local tester that uses $n$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ yet faithfully simulates the tester with $n$ queries to a random dilation. As application, we show that:
  - $O(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$.
  Moreover, when $rd_2=d_1$, we show that the Heisenberg scaling $O(1/\varepsilon)$ can be achieved, even if $\mathcal{E}$ is not a unitary channel:
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{2.5}/\varepsilon,d_1^2/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$, and $O(d_1^2/\varepsilon)$ queries suffice for the case of Choi state trace norm error $\varepsilon$.
  - $O(\min\{d_1^{1.5}/\varepsilon,d_1/\varepsilon^2\})$ queries to $\mathcal{E}$ suffice for tomography of the mixed state $\mathcal{E}(|0\rangle\langle 0|)$ to within trace norm error $\varepsilon$.</description>

Abstract: The security and decentralization of Proof-of-Work (PoW) have been well-tested in existing blockchain systems. However, its tremendous energy waste has raised concerns about sustainability. Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) aims to redirect the meaningless computation to meaningful tasks such as solving machine learning (ML) problems, giving rise to the branch of Proof-of-Learning (PoL). While previous studies have proposed various PoLs, they all, to some degree, suffer from security, decentralization, or efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a PoL framework that trains ML models efficiently while maintaining blockchain security in a fully distributed manner. We name the framework SEDULity, which stands for a Secure, Efficient, Distributed, and Useful Learning-based blockchain system. Specifically, we encode the template block into the training process and design a useful function that is difficult to solve but relatively easy to verify, as a substitute for the PoW puzzle. We show that our framework is distributed, secure, and efficiently trains ML models. We further demonstrate that the proposed PoL framework can be extended to other types of useful work and design an incentive mechanism to incentivize task verification. We show theoretically that a rational miner is incentivized to train fully honestly with well-designed system parameters. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of our framework and validate our analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we obtain the Wedderburn-Artin decomposition of a semisimple group algebra associated to a direct product of finite groups. We also provide formulae for the number of all possible group codes, and their dimensions, that can be constructed in a group algebra. As particular cases, we present the complete algebraic description of the group algebra of any direct product of groups whose direct factors are cyclic, dihedral, or generalised quaternion groups.</description>

      <title>Can Non-Signaling Assistance Increase the Degrees of Freedom of a Wireless Network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An open question posed by Fawzi and Ferme [Transactions on Information Theory 2024], asks whether non-signaling (NS) assistance can increase the capacity of a broadcast channel (BC). We answer this question in the affirmative, by showing that for a certain K-receiver BC setting, called Coordinated Multipoint (CoMP) that arises naturally in wireless networks, NS-assistance provides multiplicative gains in capacity and degrees of freedom (DoF), even achieving K-fold improvements in some cases. Somewhat surprisingly, this is shown to be true even for 2-receiver broadcast channels that are semi-deterministic and/or degraded. In a CoMP BC, B single-antenna transmitters, supported by a backhaul that allows them to share data, act as one B-antenna transmitter, to send independent messages to K receivers, each equipped with a single receive antenna. A fixed and globally known connectivity matrix M, specifies for each transmit antenna, the subset of receivers that are connected to (have a non-zero channel coefficient to) that antenna. Besides the connectivity, there is no channel state information at the transmitter. The DoF region is fully characterized for a class of connectivity patterns associated with tree graphs. Sum-capacity with NS-assistance for arbitrary connectivity patterns is bounded below and above by the triangle number and the min-rank of the connectivity matrix, respectively. While translations to Gaussian settings are demonstrated, most of our results are presented under noise-free, finite-field (Fq) models. Converse proofs for classical DoF adapt the Aligned Images bounds to the finite field model. Converse bounds for NS-assisted capacity extend the same-marginals property to the BC with NS-assistance available to all parties. Even stronger (unbounded) gains are established for certain 'communication with side-information' settings, such as the fading dirty paper channel.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Oblivious Relaying and Connections to Source Coding with a Helper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information bottleneck channel, also known as oblivious relaying, is a two-hop channel where a transmitter sends messages to a remote receiver via an intermediate relay node. A codeword sent by the transmitter passes through a discrete memoryless channel to reach the relay, which then processes the noisy channel output and forwards it to the receiver through a noiseless rate-limited link. The relay is oblivious, in the sense that it has no knowledge of the channel codebook used in transmission. Previous works on oblivious relaying focus on characterizing achievable rates. In this work, we study error exponents and explore connections to lossless source coding with a helper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem.
  We first establish an achievable error exponent for oblivious relaying under constant compositions codes. A key feature of our analysis is the use of the type covering lemma to design the relay's compress-forward scheme. We then show that employing constant composition code ensembles does not improve the rates achieved with their IID counterparts. We also derive a sphere packing upper bound for the error exponent. In the second part of this paper, we establish a connection between the information bottleneck channel and the WAK problem. We show that good codes for the latter can be produced through permuting codes designed for the former. This is accomplished by revisiting Ahlswede's covering lemma, and extending it to achieve simultaneous covering of a type class by several distinct sets using the same sequence of permutations. We then apply our approach to attain the best known achievable error exponent for the WAK problem, previously established by Kelly and Wagner. As a byproduct of our derivations, we also establish error exponents and achievable rates under mismatched decoding rules.</description>

      <title>Explicit Constructions of Sum-Rank Metric Codes from Quadratic Kummer Extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces new constructions of sum-rank metric codes derived from algebraic function fields, as existing results on such codes remain limited. A major challenge lies in the determination of their parameters. We address this issue by employing quadratic Galois extensions, proposing two general constructions of $2\times2$ sum-rank codes. Analogous to algebraic geometry codes in the Hamming metric, our codes achieve a larger block length compared to existing constructions. We determine explicit parameters including dimensions and minimum distances of our codes, and we present an illustrative example using elliptic function fields. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of our codes and compare them with the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound for sum-rank metric codes.</description>

      <title>Coding-Enforced Robust Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning Under Unreliable Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07565v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies privacy-preserving federated learning (ppFL) under unreliable communication. In ppFL, zero-sum privacy noises enables privacy protection without sacrificing model accuracy, effectively overcoming the privacy-utility trade-off. However, in practice, unreliable communication can randomly disrupt the coordination of zero-sum noises, leading to aggregation errors and unpredictable partial participation, which severely harm the model accuracy and learning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust coding-enforced structured secure aggregation method, termed secure cooperative gradient coding (SecCoGC), which enables exact reconstruction of the global model under unreliable communication while allowing for arbitrarily strong privacy preservation. In this paper, a complete problem formulation and constructions of real-field zero-sum privacy noise are presented, and fairness is introduced as a privacy metric. Privacy across all protocol layers in SecCoGC is evaluated, accounting for the correlation among privacy noises and their linear combination under unreliable communication. Moreover, a distinct convergence analysis for the FL algorithm with a binary outcome for global model recovery is provided. Experimental results demonstrate that SecCoGC achieves strong resilience to unreliable communication while maintaining varying levels of privacy preservation, yielding test accuracy improvements of up to 20%-70% over existing benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>RC-Gossip: Information Freshness in Clustered Networks with Rate-Changing Gossip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A clustered gossip network is considered in which a source updates its information over time, and end-nodes, organized in clusters through clusterheads, are keeping track of it. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., have the same information as the source, which we assess by the long-term average binary freshness metric. We introduce a smart mechanism of information dissemination which we coin rate-changing gossip (RC-Gossip). Its main idea is that gossiping is directed towards nodes that need it the most, and hence the rate of gossiping changes based on the number of fresh nodes in the network at a given time. While Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) analysis has been the norm in studying freshness of gossip networks, we present an equivalent way to analyze freshness using a renewal-reward-based approach. Using that, we show that RC-gossip significantly increases freshness of nodes in different clustered networks, with optimal cluster sizes, compared to traditional gossiping techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising technology that can exploit new spatial degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by flexibly adjusting the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of antennas. In this letter, we investigate an RA-enhanced cell-free system for downlink transmission, where multiple RA-equipped access points (APs) cooperatively serve multiple single-antenna users over the same time-frequency resource. Specifically, we aim to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the AP-user associations and the RA boresight directions. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage strategy to solve the AP-user association problem, and then employ fractional programming (FP) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques to optimize the RA boresight directions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RA-enhanced cell-free system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Approximation Factor in Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.05876v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the following problem: given two arbitrary densities $q_1,q_2$ and a sample-access to an unknown target density $p$, find which of the $q_i$'s is closer to $p$ in total variation.
  A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}= \min\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3.
  We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g.\ a mixture of densities from $\mathcal{Q}$), then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup.
  We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of 2: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\it Adaptive Data Analysis}.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Physically-Consistent Modeling of Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable electromagnetic structures (REMSs), such as reconfigurable reflectarrays (RRAs) or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), hold significant potential to improve the spectral efficiency of wireless communication systems and the accuracy of wireless sensing systems. Even though several REMS modeling approaches have been proposed in recent years, the literature lacks models that are both computationally efficient and physically consistent. As a result, algorithms that control the reconfigurable elements of REMSs (e.g., the phase shifts of a RIS) are often built on simplistic and thus inaccurate models. To enable physically accurate REMS-parameter tuning, we present a new framework for efficient and physically consistent modeling of general REMSs. Our modeling method combines a circuit-theoretic approach with a new formalism that describes a REMS's interaction with the electromagnetic (EM) waves in its far-field region. Our modeling method enables efficient computation of the entire far-field radiation pattern for arbitrary configurations of the REMS reconfigurable elements once a single full-wave EM simulation of the non-reconfigurable parts of the REMS has been performed. The predictions made by our framework align with the physical laws of classical electrodynamics and model effects caused by inter-antenna coupling, non-reciprocal materials, polarization, ohmic losses, matching losses, influence of metallic housings, noise from low-noise amplifiers, and noise arising in or received by antennas. In order to validate the efficiency and accuracy of our modeling approach, we (i) compare our modeling method to EM simulations and (ii) conduct a case study involving an RRA that enables simultaneous multiuser beam- and null-forming using a new, computationally efficient, and physically accurate parameter tuning algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09218v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a geometric perspective, we employ metric mean dimension to investigate the set of generic points of invariant measures and saturated sets in infinite entropy systems. For systems with the specification property, we establish certain variational principles for the Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions of saturated sets in terms of Kolmogorov-Sinai $\epsilon$-entropy, and prove that the upper capacity metric mean dimension of saturated sets has full metric mean dimension. Consequently, the Bowen and packing metric mean dimensions of the set of generic points of invariant measures coincide with the mean R\'enyi information dimension, and the upper capacity metric mean dimension of the set of generic points of invariant measures also has full metric mean dimension.
  As applications, for systems with the specification property, we present the qualitative characterization of the metric mean dimensions of level sets, the set of mean Li-Yorke pairs in infinite-entropy systems, and the set of generic points of invariant measures in full shifts over compact metric spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated dataset labeling with minimal human supervision. While majority voting across multiple LLMs can improve label reliability by mitigating individual model biases, it incurs high computational costs due to repeated querying. In this work, we propose a novel online framework, Cost-aware Majority Voting (CaMVo), for efficient and accurate LLM-based dataset annotation. CaMVo adaptively selects a subset of LLMs for each data instance based on contextual embeddings, balancing confidence and cost without requiring pre-training or ground-truth labels. Leveraging a LinUCB-based selection mechanism and a Bayesian estimator over confidence scores, CaMVo estimates a lower bound on labeling accuracy for each LLM and aggregates responses through weighted majority voting. Our empirical evaluation on the MMLU and IMDB Movie Review datasets demonstrates that CaMVo achieves comparable or superior accuracy to full majority voting while significantly reducing labeling costs. This establishes CaMVo as a practical and robust solution for cost-efficient annotation in dynamic labeling environments.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Analysis of Multi-Target Detection via Markovian and Hard-Core Multi-Reference Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we study the sample complexity of the multi-target detection (MTD) problem, in which an unknown signal appears multiple times at unknown locations within a long, noisy observation. We propose a patching scheme that reduces MTD to a non-i.i.d. multi-reference alignment (MRA) model. In the one-dimensional setting, the latent group elements form a Markov chain, and we show that the convergence rate of any estimator matches that of the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model, up to a logarithmic factor in the number of patches. Moreover, for estimators based on empirical averaging, such as the method of moments, the convergence rates are identical in both settings. We further establish an analogous result in two dimensions, where the latent structure arises from an exponentially mixing random field generated by a hard-core placement model. As a consequence, if the signal in the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model is determined by moments up to order $n_{\min}$, then in the low-SNR regime the number of patches required to estimate the signal in the MTD model scales as $\sigma^{2n_{\min}}$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>
