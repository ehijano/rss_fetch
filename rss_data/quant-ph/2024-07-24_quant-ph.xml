      <title>Quantum Circuits for the heat equation with physical boundary conditions via Schrodingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the explicit design of quantum circuits for quantum simulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary conditions. These equations and/or their discretized forms usually do not evolve via unitary dynamics, thus are not suitable for quantum simulation. Boundary conditions (either time-dependent or independent) make the problem more difficult. To tackle this challenge, the Schrodingerisation method can be employed, which converts linear partial and ordinary differential equations with non-unitary dynamics into systems of Schrodinger-type equations, via the so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher dimension. Despite advancements in Schrodingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of quantum circuits for solving general PDEs, especially with physical boundary conditions, remains underdeveloped. We present two methods for handling the inhomogeneous terms arising from time-dependent physical boundary conditions. One approach utilizes Duhamel's principle to express the solution in integral form and employs linear combination of unitaries (LCU) for coherent state preparation. Another method applies an augmentation to transform the inhomogeneous problem into a homogeneous one. We then apply the quantum simulation technique from [CJL23] to transform the resulting non-autonomous system to an autonomous system in one higher dimension. We provide detailed implementations of these two methods and conduct a comprehensive complexity analysis in terms of queries to the time evolution input oracle.</description>

      <title>Magic transition in measurement-only circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic, also known as nonstabilizerness, quantifies the distance of a quantum state to the set of stabilizer states, and it serves as a necessary resource for potential quantum advantage over classical computing. In this work, we study magic in a measurement-only quantum circuit with competing types of Clifford and non-Clifford measurements, where magic is injected through the non-Clifford measurements. This circuit can be mapped to a classical model that can be simulated efficiently, and the magic can be characterized using any magic measure that is additive for tensor product of single-qubit states. Leveraging this observation, we study the magic transition in this circuit using large-scale numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate the presence of a magic transition between two different phases with extensive magic scaling, separated by a critical point in which the mutual magic exhibits logarithmic scaling. We further show that these two distinct phases can be distinguished by the topological magic. In a different regime, with vanishing rate of non-Clifford measurements, we find that the magic saturates in both phases. Our work sheds light on the behavior of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits, employing genuine magic measures.</description>

      <title>Unextendible entanglement of quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication relies on the existence of high quality quantum channels to exchange information. In practice, however, all communication links are affected by noise from the environment. Here we investigate the ability of quantum channels to perform quantum communication tasks by restricting the participants to use only local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC) along with the available quantum channel. In particular, a channel can be used to distill a highly entangled state between two parties, which further enables quantum or private communication. In this work, we invoke the framework of superchannels to study the distillation of a resourceful quantum state, such as a maximally entangled state or a private state, using multiple instances of a point-to-point quantum channel. We use the idea of $k$-extendibility to obtain a semidefinite relaxation of the set of one-way LOCC superchannels and define a class of entanglement measures for quantum channels that decrease monotonically under such superchannels; therefore these measures, dubbed collectively the ``unextendible entanglement of a channel'', yield upper bounds on several communication-theoretic quantities of interest in the regimes of resource distillation and zero error. We then generalize the formalism of $k$-extendibility to bipartite superchannels, thus obtaining functions that are monotone under two-extendible superchannels. This allows us to analyze probabilistic distillation of ebits or secret key bits from a bipartite state when using a resourceful quantum channel. Moreover, we propose semidefinite programs to evaluate several of these quantities, providing a computationally feasible method of comparison between quantum channels for resource distillation.</description>

      <title>Residue imaginary velocity induces many-body delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization and delocalization are historic topics central to quantum and condensed matter physics. We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed to a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for ground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under periodic boundary conditions. Interestingly, a disorder field contributing to $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may allow strong-disorder-limit delocalization when $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ prevails over the Anderson localization. We demonstrate such delocalization with correlation and entanglement behaviors, as well as its many-body nature and generalizability to finite temperatures and interactions. Thus, the nontrivial physics of $\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches our understanding of delocalization and breeds useful applications, e.g., in quantum adiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of quantum fidelity kernels for Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing algorithms have been shown to produce performant quantum kernels for machine-learning classification problems. Here, we examine the performance of quantum kernels for regression problems of practical interest. For an unbiased benchmarking of quantum kernels, it is necessary to construct the most optimal functional form of the classical kernels and the most optimal quantum kernels for each given data set. We develop an algorithm that uses an analog of the Bayesian information criterion to optimize the sequence of quantum gates used to estimate quantum kernels for Gaussian process models. The algorithm increases the complexity of the quantum circuits incrementally, while improving the performance of the resulting kernels, and is shown to yield much higher model accuracy with fewer quantum gates than a fixed quantum circuit ansatz. We demonstrate that quantum kernels thus obtained can be used to build accurate models of global potential energy surfaces (PES) for polyatomic molecules. The average interpolation error of the six-dimensional PES obtained with a random distribution of 2000 energy points is 16 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_3$O$^+$, 15 cm$^{-1}$ for H$_2$CO and 88 cm$^{-1}$ for HNO$_2$. We show that a compositional optimization of classical kernels for Gaussian process regression converges to the same errors. This indicates that quantum kernels can achieve the same, though not better, expressivity as classical kernels for regression problems.</description>

      <title>Breadth-first graph traversal union-find decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast decoding algorithms are decisive for real-time quantum error correction and for analyzing properties of error correction codes. Here, we develop variants of the union-find decoder that simplify its implementation and provide potential decoding speed advantages. Furthermore, we show how these methods can be adapted to decode non-topological quantum low-density-parity-check (qLDPC) codes. All the developed decoders can directly include both qubit erasures and Pauli errors in the decoding step, thus addressing the dominant noise mechanisms for photonic quantum computing. We investigate the strengths and weaknesses of the different decoder variants, benchmark their speed and threshold error rates on several codes, and provide the used source code.</description>

      <title>Data Processing Inequality for The Quantum Guesswork</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal quantum states pose a fundamental challenge in quantum information processing, as they cannot be distinguished with absolute certainty. Conventionally, the focus has been on minimizing error probability in quantum state discrimination tasks. However, another criterion known as quantum guesswork has emerged as a crucial measure in assessing the distinguishability of non-orthogonal quantum states, when we are allowed to query a sequence of states. In this paper, we generalize well known properties in the classical setting that are relevant for the guessing problem. Specifically, we establish the pre and post Data Processing Inequalities. We also derive a more refined lower bound on quantum guesswork.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Mixing Condition for Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum channels, pivotal in information processing, describe transformations within quantum systems and enable secure communication and error correction. Ergodic and mixing properties elucidate their behavior. In this paper, we establish a sufficient condition for mixing based on a quantum Markov-Dobrushin inequality. We prove that if the Markov-Dobrushin constant of a quantum channel exceeds zero, it exhibits exponential mixing behavior. We explore limitations of some quantum channels, demonstrating that unistochastic channels are not mixing. Additionally, we analyze ergodicity of a class of mixed-unitary channels associated with finite groups of unitary operators. Finally, we apply our results to the qubit depolarizing channel.</description>

      <title>Controlling nonlocality of bipartite qubit states via quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores geometric aspects of the inverse Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism. It focuses on qubit channels corresponding to two-qubit circulant states that satisfy Bell's nonlocality condition. The main part is devoted to a characterization of nonlocality generating maps on the examples of both unital and non-unital maps. The advantage of this approach is that nonlocality of bipartite states can be controlled with a single parameter. The study reveals interesting geometric properties of quantum channels, contributing to the field of quantum nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Self-Ordering, Cooling and Lasing in an Ensemble of Clock Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active atomic clocks are predicted to provide far better short-term stability and robustness against thermal fluctuations than typical feedback-based optical atomic clocks. However, continuous laser operation using an ensemble of clock atoms still remains an experimentally challenging task. We study spatial self-organization in a transversely driven ensemble of clock atoms inside an optical resonator and coherent light emission from the cavity. We focus on the spectral properties of the emitted light in the narrow atomic linewidth regime, where the phase coherence providing frequency stability is stored in the atomic dipoles rather than the cavity field. The atoms are off-resonantly driven by a standing-wave coherent laser transversely to the cavity axis allowing for atomic motion along the cavity axis as well as along the pump. In order to treat larger atom numbers we employ a second-order cumulant expansion which allows us to calculate the spectrum of the cavity light field. We identify the self-organization threshold where the atoms align themselves in a checkerboard pattern thus maximizing light scattering into the cavity which simultaneously induces cooling. For a larger driving intensity, more atoms are transferred to the excited state, reducing cooling but increasing light emission from the excited atoms. This can be enhanced via a second cavity mode at the atomic frequency spatially shifted by a quarter wavelength. For large enough atom numbers we observe laser-like emission close to the bare atomic transition frequency.</description>

      <title>Quantum Detection of Recurrent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics that explores an unexpectedly small fraction of Hilbert space is inherently interesting. Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden tensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond dimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic eigenvalues can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will recur near its initial state $| \psi_0\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e. $\lVert\mathrm{U}^k | \psi_0\rangle - | \psi_0\rangle \rVert &lt; \epsilon$ is more likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit $\operatorname{closure}(\{\mathrm{U}^k\}_{k=1,2,\dots})$ is of relatively low dimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum algorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include detection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\mathrm{U} \cong V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$. "Hidden" refers to an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_v \rightarrow V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics. Hidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy context of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b, FSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in linguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational difficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral information. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing unitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix B connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor structures.</description>

      <title>Ramsey interferometry of nuclear spins in diamond using stimulated Raman adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) in nuclear-spin transitions of $^{14}$N within nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond. It is shown that the STIRAP technique suppresses the occupation of the intermediate state, which is a crucial factor for improvements in quantum sensing technology. Building on that advantage, we develop and implement a generalized version of the Ramsey interferometric scheme, employing half-STIRAP pulses to perform the necessary quantum-state manipulation with high fidelity. The enhanced robustness of the STIRAP-based Ramsey scheme to variations in the pulse parameters is experimentally demonstrated, showing good agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results pave the way for improving the long-term stability of diamond-based sensors, such as gyroscopes and frequency standards.</description>

      <title>Pauli path simulations of noisy quantum circuits beyond average case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For random quantum circuits on $n$ qubits of depth $\Theta(\log n)$ with depolarizing noise, the task of sampling from the output state can be efficiently performed classically using a Pauli path method [Aharonov et al. Proceedings of the 55th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing. 2023] . This paper aims to study the performance of this method beyond random circuits. We first consider the classical simulation of local observables in circuits composed of Clifford and T gates $\unicode{x2013}$ going beyond the average case analysis, we derive sufficient conditions for simulatability in terms of the noise rate and the fraction of gates that are T gates, and show that if noise is introduced at a faster rate than T gates, the simulation becomes classically easy. As an application of this result, we study 2D QAOA circuits that attempt to find low-energy states of classical Ising models on general graphs. There, our results shows that for hard instances of the problem, which correspond to Ising model's graph being geometrically non-local, a QAOA algorithm mapped to a geometrically local circuit architecture using SWAP gates does not have any asymptotic advantage over classical algorithms if depolarized at a constant rate. Finally, we illustrate instances where the Pauli path method fails to give the correct result, and also initiate a study of the trade-off between fragility to noise and classical complexity of simulating a given quantum circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantum computing, combinatorial optimization problems are typically addressed using QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) solvers. However, these solvers are often insufficient for tackling higher-order problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient solver designed specifically for HOBO (Higher-Order Binary Optimization) problem settings. Our approach leverages advanced techniques to effectively manage the complexity and computational demands associated with high-dimensional optimization tasks. The proposed solver is a promising tool with significant potential for future extensions in terms of formulation. This solver holds promising potential for a wide range of applications in quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the performance of different methodologies for finding the ground state of the molecule BeH2. We implement adaptive, tetris-adaptive variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), and entanglement forging to reduce computational resource requirements. We run VQE experiments on IBM quantum processing units and use error mitigation, including twirled readout error extinction (TREX) and zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) to reduce noise. Our results affirm the usefulness of VQE on noisy quantum hardware and pave the way for the usage of VQE related methods for large molecules.</description>

      <title>Capturing the spectrotemporal structure of a biphoton wave packet with delay-line-anode single-photon imagers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing photon-arrival time and position is crucial for advancing quantum technology. However, capturing spatial and temporal information efficiently remains challenging. Here, we present a novel photon-detection technique to achieve a significantly more efficient measurement of frequency-entangled biphoton than conventional photon detectors. We utilize a delay-line-anode single-photon detector (DLD), which consists of a position-sensitive delay line anode sensor behind a microchannel plate. Biphotons are obtained from the decay of biexcitons in the copper chloride semiconductor crystal. Two DLDs are coupled with a grating spectrometer exit to measure the joint spectral distributions of the biphoton. The resulting non-scanning process requires only a few minutes to obtain a temporally and spectrally resolved image, which is much quicker than the conventional biphoton frequency measurement. Our technique paves the way for all experiments in multi-mode quantum science requiring coincidence measurement.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory based on concatenating surface codes and quantum Hamming codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing quantum error correcting codes that promise a high error threshold, low resource overhead and efficient decoding algorithms is crucial to achieve large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. The concatenated quantum Hamming code is one of the potential candidates that allows for constant space overhead and efficient decoding. We study the concatenation of surface codes with quantum Hamming codes as a quantum memory, and estimate its error threshold, resource overhead and decoding time. A high error threshold is achieved, which can in principle be pushed up to the threshold of the surface code. Furthermore, the concatenated codes can suppress logical errors to a much lower level than the surface codes, under the assumption of comparable amount of resource overhead. The advantage in suppressing errors starts to show for a quantum memory of intermediate scale. Concatenating surface codes with quantum Hamming codes therefore provides a promising avenue to demonstrate small-scale fault-tolerant quantum circuits in the near future, and also paves a way for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum Rabi model for a two-level system coupled to a quantized cavity mode under periodic modulation of the cavity-dipole coupling in the ultrastrong coupling regime, leading to rich Floquet states. As an application of the theory, we show how purely mechanical driving can produce real photons, depending on the strength and frequency of the periodic coupling rate.</description>

      <title>Orbital-free density functional theory with first-quantized quantum subroutines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid scheme for performing orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) using probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE), designed for the era of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC), as a material calculation method for large-scale systems. PITE is applied to the part of OFDFT that searches the ground state of the Hamiltonian in each self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, while the other parts such as electron density and Hamiltonian updates are performed by existing algorithms on classical computers. When the simulation cell is discretized into $N_\mathrm{g}$ grid points, combined with quantum phase estimation (QPE), it is shown that obtaining the ground state energy of Hamiltonian requires a circuit depth of $O(\log N_\mathrm{g})$. The ground state calculation part in OFDFT is expected to be accelerated, for example, by creating an appropriate preconditioner from the estimated ground state energy for the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method.</description>

      <title>Persistent quantum advantage with definite photon-number states in lossy multiple-phase estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-phase estimation exploiting quantum states has broad applications in novel sensing and imaging technologies. However, the unavoidable presence of lossy environments in practical settings often diminishes the precision of phase estimations. To address this challenge, we propose an optimal multiple-phase estimation scheme that is inherently robust against photon loss, ensuring a persistent quantum advantage across all levels of photon loss. The scheme employs a multi-mode definite photon-number (DPN) state with weights optimized for given levels of photon loss. We theoretically demonstrate that the DPN state can sustain quantum enhancement in estimation precision under all levels of photon loss, compared to the classical benchmark that employs a coherent state input. The proposed scheme using DPN states generalizes earlier studies employing NOON states, which are only optimal when photon loss is small. We believe that our study, demonstrating persistent robustness to photon loss, paves the way for significant advancements in quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, enabling practical applications and quantum advantages in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escalating impacts of climate change and the increasing demand for sustainable development and natural resource management necessitate innovative technological solutions. Quantum computing (QC) has emerged as a promising tool with the potential to revolutionize these critical areas. This review explores the application of quantum machine learning and optimization techniques for climate change prediction and enhancing sustainable development. Traditional computational methods often fall short in handling the scale and complexity of climate models and natural resource management. Quantum advancements, however, offer significant improvements in computational efficiency and problem-solving capabilities. By synthesizing the latest research and developments, this paper highlights how QC and quantum machine learning can optimize multi-infrastructure systems towards climate neutrality. The paper also evaluates the performance of current quantum algorithms and hardware in practical applications and presents realistic cases, i.e., waste-to-energy in anaerobic digestion, disaster prevention in flooding prediction, and new material development for carbon capture. The integration of these quantum technologies promises to drive significant advancements in achieving climate resilience and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>The binarisation loophole in high-dimensional quantum correlation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experiments with high-dimensional quantum systems aim at observing physical properties without having to assume that all measurement devices are perfectly characterised. To implement high-dimensional measurements, it is a common practice to separately project the system onto each of the possible eigenstates followed by post-processing. Here, we argue that such measurement binarisation procedures are flawed and open a loophole in black-box correlation experiments. We point out how binarised measurements can lead to meaningless results unless artificial assumptions are introduced. We then propose a method to faithfully analyse correlations from binarised measurements. We apply this approach to well-known examples of quantum correlations in Bell, prepare-and-measure and steering experiments. For the former two, we find that binarisation permits reduced-but-yet-significant quantum advantage, while for the latter we find that binarisation can sometimes lead to undiminished quantum correlations. Our discussion emphasises the importance of both more careful data analysis and for developing genuine multi-outcome quantum measurements.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a variational quantum eigensolver with a solid-state spin system under ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulators offer the potential to utilize the quantum nature of a physical system to study another physical system. In contrast to conventional simulation, which experiences an exponential increase in computational complexity, quantum simulation cost increases only linearly with increasing size of the problem, rendering it a promising tool for applications in quantum chemistry. The variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm is a particularly promising application for investigating molecular electronic structures. For its experimental implementation, spin-based solid-state qubits have the advantage of long decoherence time and high-fidelity quantum gates, which can lead to high accuracy in the ground-state finding. This study uses the nitrogen-vacancy-center system in diamond to implement the variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm and successfully finds the eigenvalue of a specific Hamiltonian without the need for error-mitigation techniques. With a fidelity of 98.9% between the converged state and the ideal eigenstate, the demonstration provides an important step toward realizing a scalable quantum simulator in solid-state spin systems.</description>

      <title>Lowering Connectivity Requirements For Bivariate Bicycle Codes Using Morphing Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Bravyi et al. [1] proposed a set of small quantum Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes that achieve a similar circuit-level error rate to the surface code but with an improved encoding rate. In this work, we generalise a novel parity-check circuit design principle that we call morphing circuits (first introduced in [2]) and apply this methodology to BB codes. Our construction generates a new family of BB codes -- including a new $[[144,12,12]]$ "gross" code -- whose parity check circuits require a qubit connectivity of degree five instead of six. Intriguingly, each parity check circuit requires only 6 rounds of CNOT gates -- one fewer than in Ref. [1] -- even though our new codes have weight-9 stabilisers. We also show how to perform logical input/output circuits to an ancillary rotated surface code using morphing circuits, all within a biplanar layout. The new codes perform at least as well as those of Ref. [1] under uniform circuit-level noise when decoded using BP-OSD. Finally, we develop a general framework for designing morphing circuits and present a sufficient condition for its applicability to two-block group algebra codes.

      <description>arXiv:2407.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a qubit-readout architecture where the dispersive coupling is entirely mediated by a kinetic inductance. This allows us to engineer the dispersive shift of the readout resonator independent of the qubit and resonator capacitances. We validate the pure kinetic coupling concept and demonstrate various generalized flux qubit regimes from plasmon to fluxon, with dispersive shifts ranging from 60 kHz to 2 MHz at the half-flux quantum sweet spot. We achieve readout performances comparable to conventional architectures with quantum state preparation fidelities of 99.7 % and 92.7 % for the ground and excited states, respectively, and below 0.1 % leakage to non-computational states.</description>

      <title>Approximate real-time evolution operator for potential with one ancillary qubit and application to first-quantized Hamiltonian simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we compare the methods implementing the real-time evolution operator generated by a unitary diagonal matrix where its entries obey a known underlying real function. When the size of the unitary diagonal matrix is small, a well-known method based on Walsh operators gives a good and precise implementation. In contrast, as the number of qubits grows, the precise one uses exponentially increasing resources, and we need an efficient implementation based on suitable approximate functions. Using piecewise polynomial approximation of the function, we summarize the methods with different polynomial degrees. Moreover, we obtain the overheads of gate count for different methods concerning the error bound and grid parameter (number of qubits). This enables us to analytically find a relatively good method as long as the underlying function, the error bound, and the grid parameter are given. This study contributes to the problem of encoding a known function in the phase factor, which plays a crucial role in many quantum algorithms/subroutines. In particular, we apply our methods to implement the real-time evolution operator for the potential part in the first-quantized Hamiltonian simulation and estimate the resources (gate count and ancillary qubits) regarding the error bound, which indicates that the error coming from the approximation of the potential function is not negligible compared to the error from the Trotter-Suzuki formula.</description>

      <title>Heralded High-Dimensional Photon-Photon Quantum Gate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional encoding of quantum information holds the potential to greatly increase the computational power of existing devices by enlarging the accessible state space for fixed register size and by reducing the number of required entangling gates. However, qudit-based quantum computation remains far less developed than conventional qubit-based approaches, in particular for photons, which represent natural multi-level information carriers that play a crucial role in the development of quantum networks. A major obstacle for realizing quantum gates between two individual photons is the restriction of direct interaction between photons in linear media. In particular, essential logic components for quantum operations such as native qudit-qudit entangling gates are still missing for optical quantum information processing. Here we address this challenge by presenting a protocol for realizing an entangling gate -- the controlled phase-flip (CPF) gate -- for two photonic qudits in arbitrary dimension. We experimentally demonstrate this protocol by realizing a four-dimensional qudit-qudit CPF gate, whose decomposition would require at least 13 two-qubit entangling gates. Our photonic qudits are encoded in orbital angular momentum (OAM) and we have developed a new active high-precision phase-locking technology to construct a high-dimensional OAM beam splitter that increases the stability of the CPF gate, resulting in a process fidelity within a range of $ [0.64 \pm 0.01, 0.82 \pm 0.01]$. Our experiment represents a significant advance for high-dimensional optical quantum information processing and has the potential for wider applications beyond optical system.</description>

      <title>A New Variational Quantum Algorithm Based on Lagrange Polynomial Encoding to Solve Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) serve as the cornerstone for a wide range of scientific endeavours, their solutions weaving through the core of diverse fields such as structural engineering, fluid dynamics, and financial modelling. PDEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their the intricate nature, and finding solutions to PDEs often exceeds the capabilities of traditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have triggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum algorithms for solving PDEs. In this work, we introduce two different architectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange polynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the Hadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of PDEs. To demonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known PDEs are used: the damped mass-spring system from a given initial value and the Poisson equation for periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the proposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational quantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.</description>

We extend the notion of conditional mutual information to multiparty systems and introduce a family of genuinely multiparty quantum mutual information. The two versions of multiparty quantum mutual information known in the literature are part of this family. We also conjecture them to qualify for secrecy monotones useful in quantum cryptography. We give interpretations and discuss their properties and some unresolved issues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum states is essential in the realm of quantum information processing, and the development of efficient methodologies can significantly alleviate the strain on quantum resources. Within the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we integrate the initial and the target state information within the state preparation task together, so as to realize the control trajectory design between two arbitrary quantum states. Utilizing a semiconductor double quantum dots (DQDs) model, our results demonstrate that the resulting control trajectories can effectively achieve arbitrary quantum state preparation (AQSP) for both single-qubit and two-qubit systems, with average fidelities of 0.9868 and 0.9556 for the test sets, respectively. Furthermore, we consider the noise around the system and the control trajectories exhibit commendable robustness against charge and nuclear noise. Our study not only substantiates the efficacy of DRL in QSP, but also provides a new solution for quantum control tasks of multi-initial and multi-objective states, and is expected to be extended to a wider range of quantum control problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is in a period of rapid development and discovery, however it still lacks the resources and diversity of computational models of its classical complement. With the growing difficulties of classical models requiring extreme hardware and power solutions, and quantum models being limited by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, there is an emerging opportunity to solve both problems together. Here we introduce a new software model for quantum neuromorphic computing -- a quantum leaky integrate-and-fire (QLIF) neuron, implemented as a compact high-fidelity quantum circuit, requiring only 2 rotation gates and no CNOT gates. We use these neurons as building blocks in the construction of a quantum spiking neural network (QSNN), and a quantum spiking convolutional neural network (QSCNN), as the first of their kind. We apply these models to the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and KMNIST datasets for a full comparison with other classical and quantum models. We find that the proposed models perform competitively, with comparative accuracy, with efficient scaling and fast computation in classical simulation as well as on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Integrated high-performance error correction for continuous-variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integrated error-correction scheme with high throughput, low frame errors rate (FER) and high reconciliation efficiency under low signal to noise ratio (SNR) is one of the major bottlenecks to realize high-performance and low-cost continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD). To solve this long-standing problem, a novel two-stage error correction method with limited precision that is suitable for integration given limited on-chip hardware resource while maintaining excellent decoding performance is proposed, and experimentally verified on a commercial FPGA. Compared to state-of-art results, the error-correction throughput can be improved more than one order of magnitude given FER&lt;0.1 based on the proposed method, where 544.03 Mbps and 393.33 Mbps real-time error correction is achieved for typical 0.2 and 0.1 code rate, respectively. Besides, compared with traditional decoding method, the secure key rate (SKR) for CV-QKD under composable security framework can be improved by 140.09% and 122.03% by using the proposed two-stage decoding method for codes rate 0.2 and 0.1, which can support 32.70 Mbps and 5.66 Mbps real-time SKR under typical transmission distances of 25 km and 50 km, correspondingly. The record-breaking results paves the way for large-scale deployment of high-rate integrated CV-QKD systems in metropolitan quantum secure network.</description>

      <title>Some Aspects of Remote State Restoring in State Transfer Governed by XXZ-Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the remote state restoring and perfect transfer of the zero-order coherence matrix (PTZ) in a spin system governed by the XXZ-Hamiltonian conserving the excitation number. The restoring tool is represented by several nonzero Larmor frequencies in the Hamiltonian. To simplify the analysis we use two approximating models including either step-wise or pulse-type time-dependence of the Larmor frequencies. Restoring in spin chains with up to 20 nodes is studied. Studying PTZ, we consider the zigzag and rectangular configurations and optimize the transfer of the 0-order coherence matrix using geometrical parameters of the communication line as well as the special unitary transformation of the extended receiver. Overall observation is that XXZ-chains require longer time for state transfer than XX-chains, which is confirmed by the analytical study of the evolution under the nearest-neighbor approximation. We demonstrate the exponential increase of the state-transfer time with the spin chain length.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale deployment of quantum secret sharing (QSS) in quantum networks is currently challenging due to the requirements for the generation and distribution of multipartite entanglement states. Here we present an efficient source-independent QSS protocol utilizing entangled photon pairs in quantum networks. Through the post-matching method, which means the measurement events in the same basis are matched, the key rate is almost independent of the number of participants. In addition, the unconditional security of our QSS against internal and external eavesdroppers can be proved by introducing an equivalent virtual protocol. Our protocol has great performance and technical advantages in future quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of fast and efficient quantum batteries is crucial for the prospects of quantum technologies. We show that both requirements are accomplished in the paradigmatic model of a harmonic oscillator strongly coupled to a highly non-Markovian thermal reservoir. At short times, a dynamical blockade of the reservoir prevents the leakage of energy towards its degrees of freedom, promoting a significant accumulation of energy in the battery with high efficiency. The possibility of implementing these conditions in $LC$ quantum circuits opens up new avenues for solid-state quantum batteries.</description>

      <title>Influence of strong molecular vibrations on decoherence of molecular polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the transition rates, dephasing rates, and Lamb shifts for a system consisting of many molecules collectively coupled to a resonant cavity mode. Using a variational polaron master equation, we show that strong vibrational interactions inherent to molecules give rise to multi phonon processes and suppress the light--matter coupling. In the strong light--matter coupling limit, multi-phonon contributions to the transition and dephasing rates strongly dominate over single phonon contributions for typical molecular parameters. This leads to novel dependencies of the rates and spectral line widths on the number of molecules in the cavity. We also find that vibrational Lamb shifts can substantially modify the polariton energies in the strong light--matter coupling limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heisenberg uncertainty relation is at the origin of understanding minimum uncertainty states and squeezed states of light. In the recent past, sum uncertainty relation was formulated by Maccone and Pati [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 260401 (2014)] which is claimed to be stronger than the existing Heisenberg-Robertson product uncertainty relation for the set of two incompatible observables. We deduce a different sum uncertainty relation that is weaker than the previous but necessary and sufficient to define MUS for sum uncertainty relations. We claim that the MUS for the sum uncertainty relation is always the MUS for the traditional product uncertainty relation. This means that the definition of squeezed states remains completely unaffected by the stronger sum uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Super-Optimal Charging of Quantum Batteries via Reservoir Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy dissipation, typically considered an undesirable process, has recently been shown to be harnessed as a resource to optimize the performance of a quantum battery. Following this perspective, we introduce a novel technique of charging in which coherent charger-battery interaction is replaced by a dissipative interaction via an engineered shared reservoir. We demonstrate that exploiting collective effects of the engineered shared reservoir allows for extra optimization giving rise to optimal redistribution of energy, which leads to a significant enhancement in the efficiency of the charging process. The article unveils the intricacies of built-in detuning within the context of a shared environment, offering a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms involved. These findings apply naturally to quantum circuit battery architectures, suggesting the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these systems. Moreover, the super-optimal charging offers a practical justification for charger-battery configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox, a counterintuitive phenomenon where two losing strategies combine to produce a winning outcome, has been a subject of interest across various scientific fields, including quantum mechanics. In this study, we investigate the manifestation of Parrondo's paradox in discrete-time quantum walks. We demonstrate the existence of Parrondo's paradox using space and time-dependent coins without the need for a higher-dimensional coin or adding decoherence to the system. Our results enhance the feasibility of practical implementations and provide deeper insights into the underlying quantum dynamics, specifically the propagation constrained by the interference pattern of quantum walks. The implications of our results suggest the potential for more accessible and efficient designs in quantum transport, broadening the scope and application of Parrondo's paradox beyond conventional frameworks.</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of quantum advantage in simulating many-body quantum systems on quantum computers has gained momentum with advancements in quantum hardware. This work focuses on leveraging the symmetry properties of these systems, particularly particle number conservation. We investigate the qubit objects corresponding to number projection operators in the standard Jordan-Wigner fermion-to-qubit mapping, and prove a number of their properties. This reveals connections between these operators and the generalised binomial coefficients originally introduced by Kravchuk in his research on orthogonal polynomials. The generalized binomial coefficients are visualized in a Pascal's pyramid structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a system composed of scalar bosons and SU($3$) fermions in one dimension. Considering only local intra- and interspecies interactions, the system is described by the Bose-Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which is studied using the density matrix renormalization group method. In addition to the common gapless and mixed Mott insulator phases, we identify unknown gapped states, in which bosons couple with some or all flavors of fermions. We unveil different flavor-selective states characterized by itinerant fermions that coexist with an insulator state where the bosons tie with only one- or two-flavor fermions. The states reported here could be implemented in cold-atoms experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate various aspects of capacity of entanglement in certain setups whose entanglement entropy becomes extensive and obeys a volume law. In particular, considering geometric decomposition of the Hilbert space, we study this measure both in the vacuum state of a family of non-local scalar theories and also in the squeezed states of a local scalar theory. We also evaluate field space capacity of entanglement between interacting scalar field theories. We present both analytical and numerical evidences for the volume law scaling of this quantity in different setups and discuss how these results are consistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including Renyi entropies. Our study reveals some generic properties of the capacity of entanglement and the corresponding reduced density matrix in the specific regimes of the parameter space. Finally, by comparing entanglement entropy and capacity of entanglement, we discuss some implications of our results on the existence of consistent holographic duals for the models in question.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Entanglement Cloud after a Boundary Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement has been extensively used to characterize the structure of strongly correlated many-body systems. Most of these analyses focus on either spatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an entanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different non-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined spatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated many-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through non-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a local quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using negativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the model as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed, detached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly entangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the other end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics exhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away from (towards) the boundary spin.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets can become substantially extended when their binding energies become small upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the cross-over region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Linewidth of Alkali-Metal Vapor in Unresolved Zeeman Resonance Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of magnetic resonance linewidth is crucial in magnetic resonance physics and its applications. Previous studies focused on the linewidth of alkali metal atoms within the spin-exchange relaxation-free regime near zero magnetic field and in strong magnetic fields where Zeeman resonances are well resolved due to the quadratic Zeeman effect. However, the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime, which is prevalent in various magnetometer and comagnetometer applications, is not well understood. To address this, we developed a theoretical framework based on the master equation for alkali metal atoms and solved it under the rotating wave approximation and weak driving conditions. Our numerical calculations and analytical expressions reveal that the light-narrowing effect occurs only when the ratio of the spin exchange rate to the spin destruction rate exceeds a critical value. Additionally, we show that the linewidth in the unresolved Zeeman resonance regime is significantly influenced by the mutual coupling of quantum coherence between different Zeeman sublevels. These findings provide a theoretical tool for understanding spin relaxation in alkali-metal atoms and optimizing the performance of atomic magnetometers and comagnetometers operating in this regime.</description>

      <title>Matrix majorization in large samples with varying support restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say that a matrix $P$ with non-negative entries majorizes another such matrix $Q$ if there is a stochastic matrix $T$ such that $Q=TP$. We study matrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case where the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been assumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support restrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports) or the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we identify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large samples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These conditions are given in terms of multi-partite divergences that generalize the R\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically affect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the theory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new concept of eventually entanglement breaking divisible (eEB-divisible) dynamics is introduced. A dynamical map is eEB-divisible if any propagator becomes entanglement breaking in finite time. It turns out that any completely positive dynamical semigroup with a unique faithful stationary state enjoys this property. Interestingly, it is shown that eEB-divisibility is quite general and holds for a pretty large class of quantum evolutions.</description>

      <title>Time resolved quantum tomography in molecular spectroscopy by the Maximal Entropy Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science offers unprecedented precision in probing the initial moments of chemical reactions, revealing the dynamics of molecular electrons that shape reaction pathways. A fundamental question emerges: what role, if any, do quantum coherences between molecular electron states play in photochemical reactions? Answering this question necessitates quantum tomography: the determination of the electronic density matrix from experimental data, where the off-diagonal elements represent these coherences. The Maximal Entropy (MaxEnt) based Quantum State Tomography (QST) approach offers unique advantages in studying molecular dynamics, particularly with partial tomographic data. Here, we explore the application of MaxEnt-based QST on photoexcited ammonia, necessitating the operator form of observables specific to the performed measurements. We present two methodologies for constructing these operators: one leveraging Molecular Angular Distribution Moments (MADMs) which accurately capture the orientation-dependent vibronic dynamics of molecules; and another utilizing Angular Momentum Coherence Operators to construct measurement operators for the full rovibronic density matrix in the symmetric top basis. A key revelation of our study is the direct link between Lagrange multipliers in the MaxEnt formalism and the unique set of MADMs. Furthermore, we achieve a groundbreaking milestone by constructing, for the first time, the entanglement entropy of the electronic subsystem: a metric that was previously inaccessible. The entropy vividly reveals and quantifies the effects of coupling between the excited electron and nuclear degrees of freedom. Consequently, our findings open new avenues for research in ultrafast molecular spectroscopy within the broader domain of quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation bound of Gaussian matrix permanent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.01328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exact calculation and even multiplicative error estimation of matrix permanent are challenging for both classical and quantum computers. Regarding the permanents of random Gaussian matrices, the additive error estimation is closely linked to boson sampling, and achieving multiplicative error estimation requires exponentially many samplings. Our newly developed formula for matrix permanents and its corresponding quantum expression have enabled better estimation of the average additive error for random Gaussian matrices compared to Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The well-known Ryser formula has been converted into a quantum permanent estimator. When dealing with real random Gaussian square matrices of size $N$, the quantum estimator can approximate the matrix permanent with an additive error smaller than $\epsilon(\sqrt{\mathrm{e}N})^{N}$, where $\epsilon$ is the estimation precision. In contrast, Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm has an estimation error of $\epsilon(2\sqrt{N})^{N}$, which is exponentially larger ($1.2^{N}$) than the quantum method. As expected, the quantum additive error bound fails to reach the multiplicative error bound of $(2\pi N)^{1/4}\epsilon(\sqrt{N/\mathrm{e}})^{N}$. Additionally, the quantum permanent estimator can be up to quadratically faster than the classical estimator when using quantum phase estimation-based amplitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Multiparty Spohn's theorem for a combination of local Markovian and non-Markovian quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad -like master equation for two or more quantum systems connected locally to a combination of Markovian and non-Markovian heat baths. The master equation was originally formulated for multiparty systems with either exclusively Markovian or non-Markovian environments. We extend it to encompass the case of multiple quantum systems connected to a mixture of Markovian and non-Markovian heat baths. The coexistence of both non-Markovian and Markovian environments is a plausible scenario, particularly when studying hybrid physical systems such as atom-photon arrangements. We analyze the thermodynamic quantities for such a set of local environments, and derive a modified form of the Spohn's theorem for the setup. The modification of the theorem naturally leads to a witness as well as an easily computable quantifier of non-Markovianity. Expectedly, we find that for multiparty situations, where a combination of Markovian and non-Markovian heat baths are active, the response in thermodynamic system characteristics due to non-Markovian baths is prominent at times close to the initial time of evolution, whereas the long-time behavior is predominantly controlled by the Markovian ones.</description>

Abstract: We study the scattering of a single photon propagating along a waveguide in an arbitrary superposition state two frequencies with a single three-level $\Lambda$ atom in a superposition of two non-degenerate ground states where the atom is coupled to a waveguide. We find that the scattering depends on both the relative phase between the photon frequencies and the relative phase between the atomic ground states. Our results show that a three-level $\Lambda$ atom coupled to a waveguide can be used as photon phase filter that could detect the relative phase between the two frequencies of the photon superposition state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) can theoretically achieve the Holy Grail of cryptography, information-theoretic security against eavesdropping. However, in practice, discrepancies between the mathematical models assumed in security proofs and the actual functioning of the devices used in implementations prevent it from reaching this goal. Device-independent QKD is currently not a satisfactory solution to this problem, as its performance is extremely poor and most of its security proofs assume that the user devices leak absolutely no information to the outside. On the other hand, measurement-device-independent (MDI) QKD can guarantee security with arbitrarily flawed receivers while achieving high performance, and the remaining challenge is ensuring its security in the presence of source imperfections. So far, all efforts in this regard have come at a price; some proofs are suitable only for particular source imperfections, while others severely compromise the system's performance, i.e., its communication speed and distance. Here, we overcome these crucial problems by presenting a security proof in the finite-key regime against coherent attacks that can incorporate general encoding imperfections and side channels while achieving much higher performances than previous approaches. Moreover, our proof requires minimal state characterization, which facilitates its application to real-life implementations.</description>

      <title>Grover Speedup from Many Forms of the Zeno Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has previously been established that adiabatic quantum computation, operating based on a continuous Zeno effect due to dynamical phases between eigenstates, is able to realise an optimal Grover-like quantum speedup. In other words is able to solve an unstructured search problem with the same $\sqrt{N}$ scaling as Grover's original algorithm. A natural question is whether other manifestations of the Zeno effect can also support an optimal speedup in a physically realistic model (through direct analog application rather than indirectly by supporting a universal gateset). In this paper we show that they can support such a speedup, whether due to measurement, decoherence, or even decay of the excited state into a computationally useless state. Our results also suggest a wide variety of methods to realise speedup which do not rely on Zeno behaviour. We group these algorithms into three families to facilitate a structured understanding of how speedups can be obtained: one based on phase kicks, containing adiabatic computation and continuous-time quantum walks; one based on dephasing and measurement; and finally one based on destruction of the amplitude within the excited state, for which we are not aware of any previous results. These results suggest that there may be exciting opportunities for new paradigms of analog quantum computing based on these effects.</description>

      <title>Sampling Error Analysis in Quantum Krylov Subspace Diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov subspace diagonalization (QKSD) is an emerging method used in place of quantum phase estimation in the early fault-tolerant era, where limited quantum circuit depth is available. In contrast to the classical Krylov subspace diagonalization (KSD) or the Lanczos method, QKSD exploits the quantum computer to efficiently estimate the eigenvalues of large-size Hamiltonians through a faster Krylov projection. However, unlike classical KSD, which is solely concerned with machine precision, QKSD is inherently accompanied by errors originating from a finite number of samples. Moreover, due to difficulty establishing an artificial orthogonal basis, ill-conditioning problems are often encountered, rendering the solution vulnerable to noise. In this work, we present a nonasymptotic theoretical framework to assess the relationship between sampling noise and its effects on eigenvalues. We also propose an optimal solution to cope with large condition numbers by eliminating the ill-conditioned bases. Numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Hubbard model demonstrate that the error bound of finite samplings accurately predicts the experimental errors in well-conditioned regions.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement is a valuable resource in quantum information technologies. The practical implementation of entangled photon sources faces obstacles from imperfections and defects inherent in physical systems, resulting in a loss or degradation of entanglement. The topological photonic insulators, however, have emerged as promising candidates, demonstrating an exceptional capability to resist defect-induced scattering, thus enabling the development of robust entangled sources. Despite their inherent advantages, building programmable topologically protected entangled sources remains challenging due to complex device designs and weak material nonlinearity. Here we present a development in entangled photon pair generation achieved through a non-magnetic and tunable anomalous Floquet insulator, utilizing an optical spontaneous four-wave mixing process. We verify the non-classicality and time-energy entanglement of the photons generated by our topological system. Our experiment demonstrates a substantial enhancement in nonclassical photon pair generation compared to devices reliant only on topological edge states. Our result could lead to the development of resilient quantum sources with potential applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13691v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal rate at which information can be sent through a quantum channel when the transmitted signal must simultaneously carry some minimum amount of energy is characterized. To do so, we introduce the quantum-classical analogue of the capacity-power function and generalize results in classical information theory for transmitting classical information through noisy channels. We show that the capacity-power function for a classical-quantum channel, for both unassisted and private protocol, is concave and also prove additivity for unentangled and uncorrelated ensembles of input signals for such channels. This implies we do not need regularized formulas for calculation. We show these properties also hold for all noiseless channels when we restrict the set of input states to be pure quantum states. For general channels, we find that the capacity-power function is piece-wise concave. We give an elegant visual proof for this supported by numerical simulations. We connect channel capacity and properties of random quantum states. In particular, we obtain analytical expressions for the capacity-power function for the case of noiseless channels using properties of random quantum states under an energy constraint and concentration phenomena in large Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: Efficient transfer of quantum information between remote parties is a crucial challenge for quantum communication over atmospheric channels. Random fluctuations of the channel transmittance are a major disturbing factor for its practical implementation. We study correlations between channel transmittances at different moments of time and focus on two transmission protocols. The first is related to the robustness of both discrete- and continuous-variable entanglement between time-separated light pulses, showing a possibility to enlarge the effective dimension of the Hilbert space. The second addresses a selection of high-transmittance events by testing them with bright classical pulses followed by quantum light. Our results show a high capacity of the time-coherence resource for encoding and transferring quantum states of light in atmospheric channels.</description>

Abstract: With the constant flow of data from vast sources over the past decades, a plethora of advanced analytical techniques have been developed to extract relevant information from different data types ranging from labeled data, quasi-labeled data, and data with no labels known a priori. For data with at best quasi-labels, graphs are a natural representation of these data types and have important applications in many industries and scientific disciplines. Specifically, for unlabeled data, anomaly detection on graphs is a method to determine which data points do not posses the latent characteristics that is present in most other data. There have been a variety of classical methods to compute an anomalous score for the individual vertices of a respected graph, such as checking the local topology of a node,random walks, and complex neural networks. Leveraging the structure of the graph, we propose a first quantum algorithm to calculate the anomaly score of each node by continuously traversing the graph with a uniform starting position of all nodes. The proposed algorithm incorporates well-known characteristics of quantum random walks, and, taking into consideration the NISQ era and subsequent ISQ era, an adjustment to the algorithm is given to mitigate the increasing depth of the circuit. This algorithm is rigorously shown to converge to the expected probability, with respect to the initial condition.</description>

      <title>The Computational Advantage of MIP* Vanishes in the Presence of Noise</title>

Abstract: Quantum multiprover interactive proof systems with entanglement MIP* are much more powerful than its classical counterpart MIP (Babai et al. '91, Ji et al. '20): while MIP = NEXP, the quantum class MIP* is equal to RE, a class including the halting problem. This is because the provers in MIP* can share unbounded quantum entanglement. However, recent works of Qin and Yao '21 and '23 have shown that this advantage is significantly reduced if the provers' shared state contains noise. This paper attempts to exactly characterize the effect of noise on the computational power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems. We investigate the quantum two-prover one-round interactive system MIP*[poly, O(1)], where the verifier sends polynomially many bits to the provers and the provers send back constantly many bits. We show noise completely destroys the computational advantage given by shared entanglement in this model. Specifically, we show that if the provers are allowed to share arbitrarily many noisy EPR states, where each EPR state is affected by an arbitrarily small constant amount of noise, the resulting complexity class is equivalent to NEXP = MIP. This improves significantly on the previous best-known bound of NEEEXP (nondeterministic triply exponential time) by Qin and Yao '21. We also show that this collapse in power is due to the noise, rather than the O(1) answer size, by showing that allowing for noiseless EPR states gives the class the full power of RE = MIP*[poly, poly]. Along the way, we develop two technical tools of independent interest. First, we give a new, deterministic tester for the positivity of an exponentially large matrix, provided it has a low-degree Fourier decomposition in terms of Pauli matrices. Secondly, we develop a new invariance principle for smooth matrix functions having bounded third-order Fr\'echet derivatives or which are Lipschitz continous.</description>

Abstract: Integer programming (IP), as the name suggests is an integer-variable-based approach commonly used to formulate real-world optimization problems with constraints. Currently, quantum algorithms reformulate the IP into an unconstrained form through the use of binary variables, which is an indirect and resource-consuming way of solving it. We develop an algorithm that maps and solves an IP problem in its original form to any quantum system possessing a large number of accessible internal degrees of freedom that are controlled with sufficient accuracy. This work leverages the principle of superposition to solve the optimization problem. Using a single Rydberg atom as an example, we associate the integer values to electronic states belonging to different manifolds and implement a selective superposition of different states to solve the full IP problem. The optimal solution is found within a few microseconds for prototypical IP problems with up to eight variables and four constraints. This also includes non-linear IP problems, which are usually harder to solve with classical algorithms when compared to their linear counterparts. Our algorithm for solving IP is benchmarked by a well-known classical algorithm (branch and bound) in terms of the number of steps needed for convergence to the solution. This approach carries the potential to improve the solutions obtained for larger-size problems using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. Here we benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the NRE delivers results comparable to those of the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady state, in the high-temperature limit the RE again performs better and its solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless, here also the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE provides a better approximation than the RE. For too strong coupling, here the RE might even fail completely by predicting unphysical behaviour.</description>

Abstract: We consider the question of what quantum spin chains naturally encode in their Hilbert space. It turns out that quantum spin chains are rather rich systems, naturally encoding solutions to various problems in combinatorics, group theory, and algebraic geometry. In the case of the XX Heisenberg spin chain these are given by skew Kostka numbers, skew characters of the symmetric group, and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. As we show, this is revealed by a fermionic representation of the theory of "quantized" symmetric functions formulated by Fomin and Greene, which provides a powerful framework for constructing operators extracting this data from the Hilbert space of quantum spin chains. Furthermore, these operators are diagonalized by the Bethe basis of the quantum spin chain. Underlying this is the fact that quantum spin chains are examples of "quantum integrable systems." This is somewhat analogous to bosons encoding permanents and fermions encoding determinants. This points towards considering quantum integrable systems, and the combinatorics associated with them, as potentially interesting targets for quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We study discrete time crystals (DTCs) in periodically driven quantum systems, in the presence of non-Markovian dissipation. In contrast to DTCs observed in earlier works in the presence of Markovian dynamics, using the open Dicke model in presence of Jaynes-Cummings-like dissipation, we show that non-Markovian regime can be highly beneficial for stabilizing DTCs over a wide range of parameter values. This may be attributed to periodically varying dissipation rates even at long times in the case of non-Markovian dynamics. Further the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes show sharp distinctions for intermediate strengths of the dissipator coefficient, with a time-independent steady-state in the Markovian regime being replaced by varied dynamical phases, including DTC order, in the non-Markovian regime. We also verify the robustness of the DTC phase in the non-Markovian regime by introducing errors both in the Hamiltonian as well as in the dissipation. Our study shows the possibility of using DTC as a probe for non-Markovian dynamics in periodically modulated open quantum systems, at long times.</description>

Abstract: Thermal equilibrium states of local quantum many-body systems are notorious for their spatially decaying correlations, which place severe restrictions on the types of many-body entanglement structures that may be observed at finite temperatures. These restrictions may however be defied when an out-of-equilibrium steady state is considered instead. In this paper, we study the entanglement properties of free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice that contains a generic charge- and energy-conserving noninteracting impurity, and that is connected at its edges to two reservoirs with different equilibrium energy distributions. These distributions may differ in either temperature, chemical potential, or both, thereby inducing an external bias. We analytically derive exact asymptotic expressions for several quantum information measures -- the mutual information, its R\'enyi generalizations, and the fermionic negativity -- that quantify the correlation and entanglement between two subsystems located on opposite sides of the impurity. We show that all these measures scale (to a leading order) linearly with the overlap between one subsystem and the mirror image of the other (upon reflection of the latter about the impurity), independently of the distance between the subsystems. While a simple proportionality relation between the negativity and R\'enyi versions of the mutual information is observed to hold at zero temperature, it breaks down at finite temperatures, suggesting that these quantities represent strong long-range correlations of different origins. Our results generalize previous findings that were limited to the case of a chemical-potential bias at zero temperature, rigorously demonstrating that the effect of long-range volume-law entanglement is robust at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Universal Performance Gap of Neural Quantum States Applied to the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) have demonstrated significant potential in approximating ground states of many-body quantum systems, though their performance can be inconsistent across different models. This study investigates the performance of NQS in approximating the ground state of the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) model, a boson system on a two-dimensional square lattice with a perpendicular magnetic field. Our results indicate that increasing magnetic flux leads to a substantial increase in energy error, up to three orders of magnitude. Importantly, this decline in NQS performance is consistent across different optimization methods, neural network architectures, and physical model parameters, suggesting a significant challenge intrinsic to the model. Despite investigating potential causes such as wave function phase structure, quantum entanglement, fractional quantum Hall effect, and the variational loss landscape, the precise reasons for this degradation remain elusive. The HBH model thus proves to be an effective testing ground for exploring the capabilities and limitations of NQS. Our study highlights the need for advanced theoretical frameworks to better understand the expressive power of NQS which would allow a systematic development of methods that could potentially overcome these challenges.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization using a 127-qubit gate-model IBM quantum computer can outperform quantum annealers for nontrivial binary optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive quantum solver for binary combinatorial optimization problems on gate-model quantum computers that outperforms any published alternative and consistently delivers correct solutions for problems with up to 127 qubits. We provide an overview of the internal workflow, describing the integration of a customized ansatz and variational parameter update strategy, efficient error suppression in hardware execution, and overhead-free post-processing to correct for bit-flip errors. We benchmark this solver on IBM quantum computers for several classically nontrivial unconstrained binary optimization problems -- the entire optimization is conducted on hardware with no use of classical simulation or prior knowledge of the solution. First, we demonstrate the ability to correctly solve Max-Cut instances for random regular graphs with a variety of densities using up to 120 qubits, where the graph topologies are not matched to device connectivity. Next, we apply the solver to higher-order binary optimization and successfully search for the ground state energy of a 127-qubit spin-glass model with linear, quadratic, and cubic interaction terms. Use of this new quantum solver increases the likelihood of finding the minimum energy by up to $\sim1,500\times$ relative to published results using a DWave annealer, and it can find the correct solution when the annealer fails. Furthermore, for both problem types, the Q-CTRL solver outperforms a heuristic local solver used to indicate the relative difficulty of the problems pursued. Overall, these results represent the largest quantum optimizations successfully solved on hardware to date, and demonstrate the first time a gate-model quantum computer has been able to outperform an annealer for a class of binary optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counting ground state degeneracy of a $k$-local Hamiltonian is important in many fields of physics. Its complexity belongs to the problem of sharp bounded-error quantum polynomial time (#BQP) class and few methods are known for its solution. Finding ground states of a $k$-local Hamiltonian, on the other hand, is an easier problem of Quantum Merlin Arthur (QMA) class, for which many efficient methods exist. In this work, we propose an algorithm of mapping a #BQP problem into one of finding a special ground state of a $k$-local Hamiltonian. We prove that all traditional methods, which solve the QMA problem by evolution under a function of a Hamiltonian, can be used to find the special ground state from a well-designed initial state, thus can solve the #BQP problem. We combine our algorithm with power method, Lanczos method, and quantum imaginary time evolution method for different systems to illustrate the detection of phase boundaries, competition between frustration and quantum fluctuation, and potential implementations with quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>

      <title>Restrictions imposed by a pure quantum state on the results of measuring the momentum of a particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An expanded interpretation of the wave function describing a pure quantum state of a particle as a closed system is presented. It is shown that the standard, Born interpretation provides an incomplete description of the restrictions that the wave function imposes on the results of measurements of observables. In the configuration space, two fields of the particle momentum values are defined, which can be the result of measurements. These fields satisfy Heisenberg's uncertainty relations and do not allow one to predict particle trajectories in configuration space. Thus, unlike Bohmian mechanics, there are no hidden variables in our approach. The proposed approach brings ordinary quantum mechanics and Bohmian mechanics closer to each other, correcting both.</description>

      <title>Approximate inverse measurement channel for shallow shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical shadows are a versatile tool to probe many-body quantum systems, consisting of a combination of randomised measurements and classical post-processing computations. In a recently introduced version of the protocol, the randomization step is performed via unitary circuits of variable depth $t$, defining the so-called shallow shadows. For sufficiently large $t$, this approach allows one to get around the use of non-local unitaries to probe global properties such as the fidelity with respect to a target state or the purity. Still, shallow shadows involve the inversion of a many-body map, the measurement channel, which requires non-trivial computations in the post-processing step, thus limiting its applicability when the number of qubits $N$ is large. In this work, we put forward a simple approximate post-processing scheme where the infinite-depth inverse channel is applied to the finite-depth classical shadows and study its performance for fidelity and purity estimation. The scheme allows for different circuit connectivity, as we illustrate for geometrically local circuits in one and two spatial dimensions and geometrically non-local circuits made of two-qubit gates. For the fidelity, we find that the resulting estimator coincides with a known linear cross-entropy, achieving an arbitrary small approximation error $\delta$ at depth $t=O(\log (N/\delta))$ (independent of the circuit connectivity). For the purity, we show that the estimator becomes accurate at a depth $O(N)$. In addition, at those depths, the variances of both the fidelity and purity estimators display the same scaling with $N$ as in the case of global random unitaries. We establish these bounds by analytic arguments and extensive numerical computations in several cases of interest. Our work extends the applicability of shallow shadows to large system sizes and general circuit connectivity.</description>

      <title>Error correction for encoded quantum annealing revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: F. Pastawski and J. Preskill discussed error correction of quantum annealing (QA) based on a parity-encoded spin system, known as the Sourlas-Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (SLHZ) system. They pointed out that the SLHZ system is closely related to a classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) code and demonstrated its error-correcting capability through a belief propagation (BP) algorithm assuming independent random spin-flip errors. In contrast, Ablash et al. suggested that the SLHZ system does not receive the benefits of post-readout decoding. The reason is that independent random spin-flips are not the most relevant error arising from sampling excited states during the annealing process, whether in closed or open system cases. In this work, we revisit this issue: we propose a very simple decoding algorithm to eliminate errors in the readout of SLHZ systems and show experimental evidence suggesting that SLHZ system exhibits error-correcting capability in decoding annealing readouts. Our new algorithm can be thought of as a bit-flipping algorithm for LDPC codes. Assuming an independent and identical noise model, we found that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the BP algorithm. The error correcting-capability for the sampled readouts was investigated using Monte Carlo calculations that simulate the final time distribution of QA. The results show that the algorithm successfully eliminates errors in the sampled readouts under conditions where error-free state or even code state is not sampled at all. Our simulation suggests that decoding of annealing readouts will be successful if the correctable states can be sampled by annealing, and annealing can be considered to play a role as a pre-process of the classical decoding process. This knowledge will be useful for designing and developing practical QA based on the SLHZ system in the near future.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Reversible Logic Circuit Synthesis Based on Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.04298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An algorithm for reversible logic synthesis is proposed. The task is, for a given $n$-bit substitution map $P_n: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$, to find a sequence of reversible logic gates that implements the map. The gate library adopted in this work consists of multiple-controlled Toffoli gates denoted by $C^m\!X$, where $m$ is the number of control bits that ranges from 0 to $n-1$. Controlled gates with large $m \,\,(&gt;2)$ are then further decomposed into $C^0\!X$, $C^1\!X$, and $C^2\!X$ gates. A primary concern in designing the algorithm is to reduce the use of $C^2\!X$ gate (also known as Toffoli gate) which is known to be universal.
  The main idea is to view an $n$-bit substitution map as a rank-$2n$ tensor and to transform it such that the resulting map can be written as a tensor product of a rank-($2n-2$) tensor and the $2\times 2$ identity matrix. Let $\mathcal{P}_n$ be a set of all $n$-bit substitution maps. What we try to find is a size reduction map $\mathcal{A}_{\rm red}: \mathcal{P}_n \rightarrow \{P_n: P_n = P_{n-1} \otimes I_2\}$. %, where $I_m$ is the $m\times m$ identity matrix. One can see that the output $P_{n-1} \otimes I_2$ acts nontrivially on $n-1$ bits only, meaning that the map to be synthesized becomes $P_{n-1}$. The size reduction process is iteratively applied until it reaches tensor product of only $2 \times 2$ matrices.</description>

Abstract: The spectrum consistency of the three fermion family $U(1)\times U(1)$ quantum electrodynamics in three space-time dimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124 (2020) 131601] is analyzed. It has been verified that the originally proposed action violates the unitarity consistency condition in the gauge field sector by exhibiting negative norm states in the spectrum. However, the cure came through the fundamental gauge fields properly settled, consequently, the action rewritten in terms of those fundamental fields shows to be free from any spurious degrees of freedom, and the model now becomes safe for further quantization.</description>

      <title>Protecting Quantum Procrastinators with Signature Lifting: A Case Study in Cryptocurrencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current solutions to quantum vulnerabilities of widely used cryptographic schemes involve migrating users to post-quantum schemes before quantum attacks become feasible. This work deals with protecting quantum procrastinators: users that failed to migrate to post-quantum cryptography in time.
  To address this problem in the context of digital signatures, we introduce a technique called signature lifting, that allows us to lift a deployed pre-quantum signature scheme satisfying a certain property to a post-quantum signature scheme that uses the same keys. Informally, the said property is that a post-quantum one-way function is used "somewhere along the way" to derive the public-key from the secret-key. Our constructions of signature lifting relies heavily on the post-quantum digital signature scheme Picnic (Chase et al., CCS'17).
  Our main case-study is cryptocurrencies, where this property holds in two scenarios: when the public-key is generated via a key-derivation function or when the public-key hash is posted instead of the public-key itself. We propose a modification, based on signature lifting, that can be applied in many cryptocurrencies for securely spending pre-quantum coins in presence of quantum adversaries. Our construction improves upon existing constructions in two major ways: it is not limited to pre-quantum coins whose ECDSA public-key has been kept secret (and in particular, it handles all coins that are stored in addresses generated by HD wallets), and it does not require access to post-quantum coins or using side payments to pay for posting the transaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum phase transition of the one-dimensional long-range transverse-field Ising model is explored by combining the quantum Monte Carlo method and stochastic parameter optimization, specifically achieved by tuning correlation ratios so that space and imaginary time are isotropic. In our simulations, the simulator automatically determines the parameters to sample from, even without prior knowledge of the critical point and universality class. The leading order finite-size corrections are eliminated by comparing two systems with different sizes; this procedure is also performed automatically. Varying the decay exponent of the long-range interaction, $\sigma$, we investigate $\sigma$-dependence of the dynamical exponent and the other critical exponents precisely in the mean-field, non-universal, and two-dimensional classical Ising universality regimes. We successfully determine the universality boundary between the latter two as $\sigma = 7/4$ based on the dynamical exponent and settle a long-standing dispute on the location of the universality boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional mixture of two-color fermions and scalar bosons at the hardcore limit, focusing on the effect that the intraspecies next-neighbor interactions have on the zero-temperature ground state of the system for different fillings of each carrier. Exploring the problem's parameters, we observed that the non-local interaction could favor or harm the well-known mixed Mott and spin-selective Mott insulators. We also found the emergence of three unusual insulating states with charge density wave (CDW) structures in which the orders of the carriers are out of phase with each other. For instance, the immiscible CDW appears only at half-filling bosonic density, whereas the mixed CDW state is characterized by equal densities of bosons and fermions. Finally, the spin-selective CDW couples the bosons and only one kind of fermions. Appropriate order parameters were proposed for each phase to obtain the critical parameters for the corresponding superfluid-insulator transition. Our results can inspire or contribute to understanding experiments in cold-atom setups with long-range interactions or recent reports involving quasiparticles in semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

Abstract: Integrable systems offer rare examples of solvable many-body problems in the quantum world. Due to the fine-tuned structure, their realization in nature and experiment is never completely accurate, therefore effects of integrability are observed only transiently. One way to overcome this limitation is to weakly couple nearly integrable systems to baths and driving: these will stabilize integrable effects up to arbitrary time and encode them in the stationary state approximated by a generalized Gibbs ensemble. However, the description of such driven dissipative nearly integrable models is challenging and no exact analytical methods have been proposed so far. Here, we develop an iterative scheme in which integrability breaking perturbations (baths) determine the conserved quantities that play the leading role in a highly efficient truncated generalized Gibbs ensemble description. Our scheme paves the way for easier calculations in thermodynamically large systems and can be used to construct unknown conserved quantities.</description>

      <title>Elementary Quantum Recursion Schemes That Capture Quantum Polylogarithmic Time Computability of Quantum Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has been studied over the past four decades based on two computational models of quantum circuits and quantum Turing machines. To capture quantum polynomial-time computability, a new recursion-theoretic approach was taken lately by Yamakami [J. Symb. Logic 80, pp.~1546--1587, 2020] by way of recursion schematic definition, which constitutes six initial quantum functions and three construction schemes of composition, branching, and multi-qubit quantum recursion. By taking a similar approach, we look into quantum polylogarithmic-time computability and further explore the expressing power of elementary schemes designed for such quantum computation. In particular, we introduce an elementary form of the quantum recursion, called the fast quantum recursion, and formulate $EQS$ (elementary quantum schemes) of ``elementary'' quantum functions. This class $EQS$ captures exactly quantum polylogarithmic-time computability, which forms the complexity class BQPOLYLOGTIME. We also demonstrate the separation of BQPOLYLOGTIME from NLOGTIME and PPOLYLOGTIME. As a natural extension of $EQS$, we further consider an algorithmic procedural scheme that implements the well-known divide-and-conquer strategy. This divide-and-conquer scheme helps compute the parity function but the scheme cannot be realized within our system $EQS$.</description>

      <title>Tunable exciton polaritons in band-gap engineered hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a two-dimensional insulator, when subjected to an external superlattice potential forms a new paradigm for electrostatically tunable excitons in the near- and mid-ultraviolet (UV). The imposed potential has three consequences: (i) it renormalizes the effective mass tensor, leading to anisotropic effective masses; (ii) it renormalizes the band gap, eventually reducing it; (iii) it reduces the exciton binding energies. All these consequences depend on a single dimensionless parameter, which includes the product of strength of the external potential with its period. In addition to the excitonic energy levels, we compute the optical conductivity along two orthogonal directions, and from it the absorption spectrum. The results for the latter show that our system is able to mimic a grid polarizer. These characteristics make one-dimensional hBN superlattices a viable and unexplored platform for fine-tuned polaritonics in the UV to visible spectral range.</description>

      <title>Universal control of four singlet-triplet qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherent control of interacting spins in semiconductor quantum dots is of strong interest for quantum information processing as well as for studying quantum magnetism from the bottom up. Here, we present a $2\times4$ germanium quantum dot array with full and controllable interactions between nearest-neighbor spins. As a demonstration of the level of control, we define four singlet-triplet qubits in this system and show two-axis single-qubit control of each qubit and SWAP-style two-qubit gates between all neighbouring qubit pairs, yielding average single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.49(8)-99.84(1)% and Bell state fidelities of 73(1)-90(1)%. Combining these operations, we experimentally implement a circuit designed to generate and distribute entanglement across the array. A remote Bell state with a fidelity of 75(2)% and concurrence of 22(4)% is achieved. These results highlight the potential of singlet-triplet qubits as a competing platform for quantum computing and indicate that scaling up the control of quantum dot spins in extended bilinear arrays can be feasible.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanically-induced nonequilibrium quantum phase transition to a self-organized density wave of a Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a nonequilibrium quantum phase transition (NQPT) in a hybrid quantum many-body system consisting of a vibrational mode of a damped nanomembrane interacting optomechanically with a cavity, whose output light couples to two internal states of an ultracold Bose gas held in an external quasi-one-dimensional box potential. For small effective membrane-atom couplings, the system is in a homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) steady state, with no membrane displacement. Depending on the transition frequency between the two internal atomic states, either one or both internal states are occupied. By increasing the atom-membrane couplings, the system transitions to a symmetry-broken self-organized BEC phase, which is characterized by a considerably displaced membrane steady-state and density-wave-like BEC profiles. This NQPT can be both discontinuous and continuous for a certain interval of transition frequencies and is purely discontinuous outside of it.</description>

      <title>Phase-space representation of coherent states generated through SUSY QM for tilted anisotropic Dirac materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the electron interaction within tilted anisotropic Dirac materials when subjected to external electric and magnetic fields possessing translational symmetry. Specifically, we focus on a distinct non-zero electric field magnitude, enabling the decoupling of the differential equation system inherent in the eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics facilitates the determination of eigenstates and eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian operator. To delve into a semi-classical analysis of the system, we identify a set of coherent states. Finally, we assess the characteristics of these states using fidelity and the phase-space representation through the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Enhancing GPU-acceleration in the Python-based Simulations of Chemistry Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe our contribution as industrial stakeholders to the existing open-source GPU4PySCF project (https: //github.com/pyscf/gpu4pyscf), a GPU-accelerated Python quantum chemistry package. We have integrated GPU acceleration into other PySCF functionality including Density Functional Theory (DFT), geometry optimization, frequency analysis, solvent models, and density fitting technique. Through these contributions, GPU4PySCF v1.0 can now be regarded as a fully functional and industrially relevant platform which we demonstrate in this work through a range of tests. When performing DFT calculations on modern GPU platforms, GPU4PySCF delivers 30 times speedup over a 32-core CPU node, resulting in approximately 90% cost savings for most DFT tasks. The performance advantages and productivity improvements have been found in multiple industrial applications, such as generating potential energy surfaces, analyzing molecular properties, calculating solvation free energy, identifying chemical reactions in lithium-ion batteries, and accelerating neural-network methods. With the improved design that makes it easy to integrate with the Python and PySCF ecosystem, GPU4PySCF is natural choice that we can now recommend for many industrial quantum chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Universality of the thermodynamics of a quantum-mechanically radiating black hole departing from thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathur and Mehta won the third prize in the 2023 Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition for proving the universality of black hole (BH) thermodynamics. Specifically, they demonstrated that any Extremely Compact Object (ECO) must have the same BH thermodynamic properties regardless of whether or not the ECO possesses an event horizon. The result is remarkable, but it was obtained under the approximation according to which the BH emission spectrum has an exactly thermal character. In fact, strong arguments based on energy conservation and BH back reaction imply that the spectrum of the Hawking radiation cannot be exactly thermal. In this work the result of Mathur and Mehta will be extended to the case where the radiation spectrum is not exactly thermal using the concept of BH dynamical state.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing bounce and inflation via quantum signatures from cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological inflation is a popular paradigm for understanding Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR); however, it faces many conceptual challenges. An alternative mechanism to inflation for generating an almost scale-invariant spectrum of perturbations is a \emph{bouncing cosmology} with an initial matter-dominated contraction phase, during which the modes corresponding to currently observed scales exited the Hubble radius. Bouncing cosmology avoids the initial singularity but has fine-tuning problems. Taking an \emph{agnostic view} of the two early-universe paradigms, we propose a quantum measure -- Dynamical Fidelity Susceptibility (DFS) of CMBR -- that distinguishes the two scenarios. Taking two simple models with the same power-spectrum, we explicitly show that DFS behaves differently for the two scenarios. We discuss the possibility of using DFS as a distinguisher in the upcoming space missions.</description>

      <title>Crystalline invariants of fractional Chern insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of crystalline symmetry, topologically ordered states can acquire a host of symmetry-protected invariants. These determine the patterns of crystalline symmetry fractionalization of the anyons in addition to fractionally quantized responses to lattice defects. Here we show how ground state expectation values of partial rotations centered at high symmetry points can be used to extract crystalline invariants. Using methods from conformal field theory and G-crossed braided tensor categories, we develop a theory of invariants obtained from partial rotations, which apply to both Abelian and non-Abelian topological orders. We then perform numerical Monte Carlo calculations for projected parton wave functions of fractional Chern insulators, demonstrating remarkable agreement between theory and numerics. For the topological orders we consider, we show that the Hall conductivity, filling fraction, and partial rotation invariants fully characterize the crystalline invariants of the system. Our results also yield invariants of continuum fractional quantum Hall states protected by spatial rotational symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of interacting fermions in the continuum. Our approach uses the concept of lattice-localized frames, which we introduce here. We first prove a Lieb-Robinson bound that is valid for a general class of local interactions, which implies the existence of the dynamics at the level of the CAR algebra. We then turn to the physical situation relevant to the (fractional) quantum Hall effect, namely the quasi-free second quantized Landau Hamiltonian to which electron-electron interactions can be added.</description>
