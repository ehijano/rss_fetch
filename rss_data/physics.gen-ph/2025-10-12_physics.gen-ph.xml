      <title>What gauges can be used in applied electromagnetic calculations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the classical electrodynamics, different gauges, i.e. connections between the electromagnetic potentials, are used. Some of these are quite specific and intended for calculations in special systems (absence of free charges, etc.). All of these specific gauges are reductions of the Lorenz gauge. However, in addition to this gauge, two more, i.e., the Coulomb and velocity gauges, can be used to describe systems of charges and currents without any restrictions.
  It is commonly accepted opinion that these three gauges are equivalent, meaning that the expressions for electromagnetic fields obtained from the potentials defined in these gauges are identical. However, it can be shown that the Coulomb and velocity gauges yield solutions corresponding to `superluminal propagation' of the electric field. Since such a propagation of the electric field has not been observed experimentally and, moreover, is forbidden by special relativity, it can be concluded that calculations in these gauges may yield incorrect results. Therefore, these gauges cannot be used in applied electromagnetic calculations.</description>

      <title>Universality of critical behaviors in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives a brief overview on recent advances in experiments of critical exponents in three groups of magnetic materials. Revisiting experimental data verifies that a universality class with the critical exponents beta = 3/8, gamma = 5/4 and delta = 13/3 occurs in the three-dimensional (3D) Ising magnets, such as transition-metal intermetallics, rare-earth transition-metal compounds and manganites. Furthermore, the topological contributions to critical behaviors in the 3D Ising model are estimated by the difference between the exact solutions and the approximation values.</description>
