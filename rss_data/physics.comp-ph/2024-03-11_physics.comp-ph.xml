      <title>XFLUIDS: A SYCL-based unified cross-architecture heterogeneous simulation solver for compressible reacting flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cross-architecture large-scale heterogeneous Navier-Stokes equation solver, XFLUIDS, for compressible reacting multicomponent flows in the three-dimensional structured mesh crossing different GPU platforms. The multi-component reacting flows are ubiquitous in many situations, with high-order FDM schemes used and calculation of reaction source integration, their numerical simulations are time-consuming to achieve high accuracy and capture the underlying multiscale features, and GPU-based acceleration methods are extremely helpful. At the same time, various accelerators have been released in the market, leading to a challenge of applications' adaptability. Based on an implementation of a heterogeneous programming standard, SYCL, it is now possible to develop heterogeneous parallel acceleration applications directly targeting multi-core CPUs, FPGAs, and GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, as well as Intel without translating any source code, demonstrating its high portability. MPI library is used to extend the solver to multi-GPU accelerated computing, with the GPU-ENABLED MPI technology supporting the direct data transmission between GPUs to reduce communication latency, and the weak-scaling and strong-scaling efficiency tested. This solver has been validated by several benchmark cases, including shock tube problems, diffusion problems, nitrogen dissociation problems, shock-bubble interaction problems, etc.</description>

      <title>Global sensitivity analysis in Monte Carlo radiation transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Global Sensitivity Analysis for Monte Carlo radiation transport applications. GSA is usually combined with Uncertainty Quantification, where the latter quantifies the variability of a model output in the presence of uncertain inputs and the former attributes this variability to the inputs. The additional noise inherent to MC RT solvers due to the finite number of particle histories presents an additional challenge to GSA and UQ, which are well-established for deterministic solvers. In this contribution, we apply variance deconvolution to the Saltelli method to address MC RT solver noise without having to over-resolve the MC RT simulation.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Stride-Based RNG for Monte Carlo Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techniques used to generate pseudo-random numbers for Monte Carlo (MC) applications bear many implications on the quality and speed of that programs work. As a random number generator (RNG) slows, the production of random numbers begins to dominate runtime. As RNG output grows in correlation, the final product becomes less reliable.
  These difficulties are further compounded by the need for reproducibility and parallelism. For reproducibility, the numbers generated to determine any outcome must be the same each time a simulation is run. However, the concurrency that comes with most parallelism introduces race conditions. To have both reproducibility and concurrency, separate RNG states must be tracked for each independently schedulable unit of simulation, forming independent random number streams.
  We propose an alternative to the stride-based parallel LCG seeding approach that scales more practically with increased concurrency and workload by generating seeds through hashing and allowing for repeated outputs. Data gathered from normality tests of tally results from simple MC transport benchmark calculations indicates that the proposed hash-based RNG does not significantly affect the tally result normality property as compared to the conventional stride-based RNG.</description>

      <title>A Naive Model of Covid-19 Spread From A Dry Cough</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health experts have suggested that social distancing measures are one of the most effective ways of preventing the spread of Covid-19. Research primarily focused on large Covid filled droplets suggested that these droplets can move further than regulated social distancing guidelines (2 meters apart) in the presence of wind. This project aims to model the paths of smaller Covid virions that last longer in the air to see if they also move beyond social distancing norms in the presence of wind. By numerically solving a 2-dimensional Langevin equation for 3000 particles and modeling wind as one-dimensional and steady, velocities were found that translated into particles' positions. With wind, infectious doses of virions appeared to travel farther and faster, increasing the risk of infection before dispersion. The two-dimensional model given implies that social distancing norms are reasonable in cases with no wind, yet not conservative enough when there is wind.</description>

      <title>Waiting times for sea level variations in Port of Trieste: from scale-free to exponential-like distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here a series of detailed statistical analyses on the sea level variations in the Port of Trieste using one of the largest existing catalogues that covers more than a century of measurements. We show that the distribution of waiting times, which are defined here akin to econophysics, namely the series of shortest time spans between a given sea level L and the next sea level of at least L + {\delta} in the catalogue, exhibits a distinct scale-free character for small values of {\delta}, while for larger values of {\delta} the distribution is very similar to the exponential distribution. The distribution of waiting times for small values of {\delta} is typical for complex systems exhibiting criticality and is reported abundantly in the literature, while the exponential-like distribution observed for large values of {\delta} has been observed in contexts as diverse as magnetic systems and light sleep duration.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study on solving the Helmholtz equation in 3D with PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room acoustic simulations at low frequencies often face significant uncertainties of material parameters and boundary conditions due to absorbing material. We discuss the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the (forward) Helmholtz equation in three dimensions (3D), employing mini-batch stochastic gradient descent with periodic resampling every 100 iterations for memory-efficient training. Addressing the computational challenges posed by the extension of PINNs from 2D to 3D for acoustics, DeepXDE is used for implementing the forward PINN. The proposed numerical method is benchmarked against an analytical solution of a standing wave field in 3D. The PINN results are also compared to the Finite Element Method (FEM) solutions for a 3D wave field computed with openCFS. The alignment between PINN-generated solutions and analytical/FEM solutions shows the feasibility of PINNs modeling 3D acoustic applications for future inverse problems, and validating the accuracy and reliability of the proposed approach. Compared to FEM, establishing the PINN model took few hours (similar to the setup of a FEM simulation), the training took 38h to 42.8h (which is longer than the solution of the FEM simulation, which took 17min-19min), and the inference took 0.05 seconds being more than 20,000 times faster than the FEM benchmark openCFS using the same number of degrees of freedomwhen producing the results. Thereby, the insight is gained that 3D acoustic wave simulations in the frequency domain are feasible for forward PINNs and can predict complex wave behaviors in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Validation of the GreenX library time-frequency component for efficient GW and RPA calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations based on many-body perturbation theory (e.g. \textit{GW} or the random-phase approximation (RPA)) require function evaluations in the complex time and frequency domain, for example inhomogeneous Fourier transforms or analytic continuation from the imaginary axis to the real axis. For inhomogeneous Fourier transforms, the time-frequency component of the GreenX library provides time-frequency grids that can be utilized in low-scaling RPA and \textit{GW} implementations. In addition, the adoption of the compact frequency grids provided by our library also reduces the computational overhead in RPA implementations with conventional scaling. In this work, we present low-scaling \textit{GW} and conventional RPA benchmark calculations using the GreenX grids with different codes (FHI-aims, CP2K and ABINIT) for molecules, two-dimensional materials and solids. Very small integration errors are observed when using 30 time-frequency points for our test cases, namely $&lt;10^{-8}$\,eV/electron for the RPA correlation energies, and $\le 10$~meV for the $GW$ quasiparticle energies.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics simulation of the abrupt changes in the thermodynamic properties of water after formation of nano-bubbles / nano-cavities induced by passage of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale formalism that accounts for the formation of nano-scale bubbles/cavities owing to a burst of water molecules after the passage of high energy charged particles that leads to the formation of hot non-ionizing excitations or thermal spikes (TS). We demonstrate the coexistence of a rapidly growing condensed state of water and a hot spot that forms a stable state of diluted water at high temperatures and pressures, possibly at a supercritical phase. Depending on the temperature of TS, the thin shell of a highly dense state of water grows by three to five times the speed of sound in water, forming a thin layer of shock wave (SW) buffer, wrapping around the nano-scale cylindrical symmetric cavity. The stability of the cavity, as a result of the incompressibility of water at ambient conditions and the surface tension, allows the transition of supersonic SW to a subsonic contact discontinuity and dissipation to thermo-acoustic sound waves. We further study the mergers of nanobubbles that lead to fountain-like or jet-flow structures at the collision interface. We introduce a time delay in the nucleation of nano-bubbles, a novel mechanism, responsible for the growth and stability of much larger or even micro-bubbles, possibly relevant to FLASH ultra-high dose rate (UHDR). The current study is potentially significant at FLASH-UHDRs. Our analysis predicts the black-body radiation from the transient supercritical state of water localized in nano-cavities wrapping around the track of charged particles can be manifested in the (indirect) water luminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Balance for Differential Constitutive Models under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harmonic balance (HB) is a popular Fourier-Galerkin method used in the analysis of nonlinear vibration problems where dynamical systems are subjected to periodic forcing. We adapt HB to find the periodic steady-state response of nonlinear differential constitutive models subjected to large amplitude oscillatory shear flow. By incorporating the alternating-frequency-time scheme into HB, we develop a computer program called FLASH (acronym for Fast Large Amplitude Simulation using Harmonic balance), which makes it convenient to apply HB to any differential constitutive model. We validate FLASH by considering two representative constitutive models, viz., the exponential Phan-Thien Tanner model and a nonlinear temporary network model. In terms of accuracy and speed, FLASH outperforms the conventional approach of solving initial value problems by numerical integration via time-stepping methods often by several orders of magnitude. We discuss how FLASH can be conveniently extended for other nonlinear constitutive models, which opens up potential applications in model calibration and selection, and stability analysis.</description>

      <title>DEMPgen: Physics event generator for Deep Exclusive Meson Production at Jefferson Lab and the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in deep exclusive meson production (DEMP) reactions, as they provide access to Generalized Parton Distributions over a broad kinematic range, and are the only means of measuring pion and kaon charged electric form factors at high $Q^2$. Such investigations are a particularly useful tool in the study of hadronic structure in QCD's transition regime from long-distance interactions described in terms of meson-nucleon degrees of freedom, to short-dist ance interactions governed by hard quark-gluon degrees of freedom. To assist the planning of future experimental investigations of DEMP reactions in this transition regime, such as at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), we have written a special purpose event generator, DEMPgen. Several types of DEMP reactions can be generated: $t$-channel $p(e,e^{\prime}\pi^+)n$, $p(e,e^{\prime}K^+)\Lambda[\Sigma^0]$, and $\vec{n}(e,e^{\prime}\pi^-)p$ from a polarized $^3$He target. DEMPgen is modular in form, so that additional reactions can be added over time. The generator produces kinematically-complete reaction events which are absolutely-normalized, so that projected event rates can be predicted, and detector resolution requirements studied. The event normalization is based on parameterizations of theoretical models, appropriate to the kinematic regime under study. Both fixed target modes and collider beam modes are supported. This paper presents the structure of the generator, the model parameterizations used for absolute event weighting, the kinematic distributions of the generated particles, some initial results using the generator, and instructions for its use.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Modeling of Surface Diffusion Coupled with Large Deformation in 3D Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and computational model that explores the behavior of a thin hydrated film bonded to a non-hydrated / impermeable soft substrate in the context of surface and bulk elasticity coupled with surface diffusion kinetics. This type of coupling can manifests as an integral aspect in diverse engineering processes encountered in optical interference coatings, tissue engineering, soft electronics, and can prove important in design process for the next generation of sensors and actuators, especially as the focus is shifted to systems in smaller lengthscales. The intricate interplay between solvent diffusion and deformation of the film is governed by surface poroelasticity, and the viscoelastic deformation of the substrate. While existing methodologies offer tools for studying coupled poroelasticity involving solvent diffusion and network deformation, there exists a gap in understanding how coupled poroelastic processes occurring in a film attached to the boundary of a highly deformable solid can influence its response. In this study, we introduce a non-equilibrium thermodynamics formulation encompassing the multiphysical processes of surface poroelasticity and bulk viscoelasticity, complemented by a corresponding finite element implementation. Our approach captures the complex dynamics between the finite deformation of the substrate and solvent diffusion on the surface. This work contributes valuable insights, particularly in scenarios where the coupling of surface diffusion kinetics and substrate elasticity is an important design factor.</description>

      <title>pETNNs: Partial Evolutionary Tensor Neural Networks for Solving Time-dependent Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs), a novel framework for solving time-dependent partial differential equations with both of high accuracy and remarkable extrapolation. Our proposed architecture leverages the inherent accuracy of tensor neural networks, while incorporating evolutionary parameters that enable remarkable extrapolation capabilities. By adopting innovative parameter update strategies, the pETNNs achieve a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining precision and robustness. Notably, the pETNNs enhance the accuracy of conventional evolutional deep neural networks and empowers computational abilities to address high-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the pETNNs in solving time-dependent complex equations, including the Navier-Stokes equations, high-dimensional heat equation, high-dimensional transport equation and Korteweg-de Vries type equation.</description>

      <title>HINORA, a method for detecting ring-like structures in 3D point distributions I: application to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method - called HINORA (HIgh-NOise RANdom SAmple Consensus) - for the identification of regular structures in 3D point distributions. Motivated by the possible existence of the so called Council of Giants, i.e. a ring of twelve massive galaxies surrounding the Local Group in the Local Sheet with a radius of 3.75 Mpc, we apply HINORA to the Local Volume Galaxy catalogue confirming its existence. When varying the lower limit of K-band luminosity of the galaxy entering the catalogue, we further report on the existence of another ring-like structure in the Local Volume that now contains the Milky Way and M31. However, this newly found structure is dominated by low-mass (satellite) galaxies. While we here simply present the novel method as well as its first application to observational data, follow-up work using numerical simulations of cosmic structure formation shall shed light into the origin of such regular patterns in the galaxy distribution. Further, the method is equally suited to identify similar (or even different) structures in various kinds of astrophysical data (e.g. locating the actual 'baryonic-acoustic oscillation spheres' in galaxy redshift surveys).</description>

      <title>Active Learning for Rapid Targeted Synthesis of Compositionally Complex Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of advanced materials is tending toward increasingly complex compositions. Synthesizing precise composition is time-consuming and becomes exponentially demanding with increasing compositional complexity. An experienced human operator does significantly better than a beginner but still struggles to consistently achieve precision when synthesis parameters are coupled. The time to optimize synthesis becomes a barrier to exploring scientifically and technologically exciting compositionally complex materials. This investigation demonstrates an Active Learning (AL) approach for optimizing physical vapor deposition synthesis of thin-film alloys with up to five principal elements. We compared AL based on Gaussian Process (GP) and Random Forest (RF) models. The best performing models were able to discover synthesis parameters for a target quinary alloy in 14 iterations. We also demonstrate the capability of these models to be used in transfer learning tasks. RF and GP models trained on lower dimensional systems (i.e. ternary, quarternary) show an immediate improvement in prediction accuracy compared to models trained only on quinary samples. Furthermore, samples that only share a few elements in common with the target composition can be used for model pre-training. We believe that such AL approaches can be widely adapted to significantly accelerate the exploration of compositionally complex materials.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Pseudo-Random Number Generators in QMC-SSE Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method, the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) plays a crucial role in determining the computation time. However, the hidden structure of the PRNG may lead to serious issues such as the breakdown of the Markov process. Here, we systematically analyze the performance of the different PRNGs on the widely used QMC method -- stochastic series expansion (SSE) algorithm. To quantitatively compare them, we introduce a quantity called QMC efficiency that can effectively reflect the efficiency of the algorithms. After testing several representative observables of the Heisenberg model in one and two dimensions, we recommend using LCG as the best choice of PRNGs. Our work can not only help improve the performance of the SSE method but also shed light on the other Markov-chain-based numerical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Motifs in earthquake networks: Romania, Italy, United States of America, and Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of seismic activity in Romania, Italy, and Japan, as well as the California seismic zone in the United States of America, based on the statistical analysis of the underlying earthquake networks used to model the aforementioned zones. Our results on network connectivity and simple network motifs allow for a complex description of seismic zones, while at the same time reinforcing the current understanding of seismicity as a critical phenomenon. The reported distributions on node connectivity, three-, and four-event motifs are consistent with power-law, i.e., scale-free, distributions over large intervals and are robust across earthquake networks obtained from different discretizations of the seismic zones of interest. In our analysis of the distributions of node connectivity and simple motifs, we distinguish between the global distribution and the powerlaw part of it with the help of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method and complementary cumulative distribution functions (CCDF). The main message is that the distributions reported for the aforementioned seismic zones have large power-law components, extending over some orders of magnitude, independent of discretization. All the results were obtained using publicly-available databases and open-source software, as well as a new toolbox available on GitHub, specifically designed to automatically analyze earthquake databases.</description>

      <title>PhAST: Physics-Aware, Scalable, and Task-specific GNNs for Accelerated Catalyst Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12020v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating the climate crisis requires a rapid transition towards lower-carbon energy. Catalyst materials play a crucial role in the electrochemical reactions involved in numerous industrial processes key to this transition, such as renewable energy storage and electrofuel synthesis. To reduce the energy spent on such activities, we must quickly discover more efficient catalysts to drive electrochemical reactions. Machine learning (ML) holds the potential to efficiently model materials properties from large amounts of data, accelerating electrocatalyst design. The Open Catalyst Project OC20 dataset was constructed to that end. However, ML models trained on OC20 are still neither scalable nor accurate enough for practical applications. In this paper, we propose task-specific innovations applicable to most architectures, enhancing both computational efficiency and accuracy. This includes improvements in (1) the graph creation step, (2) atom representations, (3) the energy prediction head, and (4) the force prediction head. We describe these contributions, referred to as PhAST, and evaluate them thoroughly on multiple architectures. Overall, PhAST improves energy MAE by 4 to 42$\%$ while dividing compute time by 3 to 8$\times$ depending on the targeted task/model. PhAST also enables CPU training, leading to 40$\times$ speedups in highly parallelized settings. Python package: \url{https://phast.readthedocs.io}.</description>

      <title>Generalizable improvement of the Spalart-Allmaras model through assimilation of experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the use of model and data fusion for improving the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) closure model for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions of separated flows. In particular, our goal is to develop of models that not-only assimilate sparse experimental data to improve performance in computational models, but also generalize to unseen cases by recovering classical SA behavior. We achieve our goals using data assimilation, namely the Ensemble Kalman Filtering approach (EnKF), to calibrate the coefficients of the SA model for separated flows. A holistic calibration strategy is implemented via a parameterization of the production, diffusion, and destruction terms. This calibration relies on the assimilation of experimental data collected velocity profiles, skin friction, and pressure coefficients for separated flows. Despite using of observational data from a single flow condition around a backward-facing step (BFS), the recalibrated SA model demonstrates generalization to other separated flows, including cases such as the 2D-bump and modified BFS. Significant improvement is observed in the quantities of interest, i.e., skin friction coefficient ($C_f$) and pressure coefficient ($C_p$) for each flow tested. Finally, it is also demonstrated that the newly proposed model recovers SA proficiency for external, unseparated flows, such as flow around a NACA-0012 airfoil without any danger of extrapolation, and that the individually calibrated terms in the SA model are targeted towards specific flow-physics wherein the calibrated production term improves the re-circulation zone while destruction improves the recovery zone.</description>

      <title>DynAMO: Multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic anticipatory mesh optimization with applications to hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce DynAMO, a reinforcement learning paradigm for Dynamic Anticipatory Mesh Optimization. Adaptive mesh refinement is an effective tool for optimizing computational cost and solution accuracy in numerical methods for partial differential equations. However, traditional adaptive mesh refinement approaches for time-dependent problems typically rely only on instantaneous error indicators to guide adaptivity. As a result, standard strategies often require frequent remeshing to maintain accuracy. In the DynAMO approach, multi-agent reinforcement learning is used to discover new local refinement policies that can anticipate and respond to future solution states by producing meshes that deliver more accurate solutions for longer time intervals. By applying DynAMO to discontinuous Galerkin methods for the linear advection and compressible Euler equations in two dimensions, we demonstrate that this new mesh refinement paradigm can outperform conventional threshold-based strategies while also generalizing to different mesh sizes, remeshing and simulation times, and initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Sphractal: Estimating the Fractal Dimension of Surfaces Computed from Precise Atomic Coordinates via Box-Counting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fractal dimension of a surface allows its degree of roughness to be characterized quantitatively. However, limited effort is attempted to calculate the fractal dimension of surfaces computed from precisely known atomic coordinates from computational biomolecular and nanomaterial studies. This work proposes methods to estimate the fractal dimension of the surface of any 3D object composed of spheres, by representing the surface as either a voxelized point cloud or a mathematically exact surface, and computing its box-counting dimension. Sphractal is published as a Python package that provides these functionalities, and its utility is demonstrated on a set of simulated palladium nanoparticle data.</description>

      <title>Insights into Multiscale Complexity: from Macroscopic Patterns to Microscopic Simulations via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale phenomena manifest across various scientific domains, presenting a ubiquitous challenge in accurately and effectively simulating multiscale dynamics in complex systems. In this paper, a novel decoupling solving mode is proposed through modelling large-scale dynamics independently and treating small-scale dynamics as a slaved system. A Spectral Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is developed to characterize the small-scale system in an efficient and accurate way. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments, including one-dimensional Kuramot-Sivashinsky equation, two- and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, showcasing its versatility in addressing problems of fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we also delve into the application of the proposed approach to more complex problems, including non-uniform meshes, complex geometries, large-scale data with noise, and high-dimensional small-scale dynamics. The discussions about these scenarios contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations. This paper presents a valuable and promising approach to enhance the computational simulations of multiscale spatiotemporal systems, which enables the acquisition of large-scale data with minimal computational demands, followed by Spectral PINN to capture small-scale dynamics with improved efficiency and accuracy.</description>
