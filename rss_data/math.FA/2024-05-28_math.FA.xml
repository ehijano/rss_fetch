      <title>Spectral theory for fractal pseudodifferential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with the distribution of eigenvalues of the compact fractal pseudodifferential operator $T^\mu_\tau$, \[ \big( T^\mu_\tau f\big)(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} e^{-ix\xi} \, \tau(x,\xi) \, \big( f\mu \big)^\vee (\xi) \, \mathrm{d} \xi, \qquad x\in \mathbb{R}^n, \] in suitable special Besov spaces $B^s_p (\mathbb{R}^n) = B^s_{p,p} (\mathbb{R}^n)$, $s&gt;0$, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Here $\tau(x,\xi)$ are the symbols of (smooth) pseudodifferential operators belonging to appropriate H\"{o}rmander classes $\Psi^\sigma_{1, \varrho} (\mathbb{R}^n)$, $\sigma &lt;0$, $0 \le \varrho \le 1$ (including the exotic case $\varrho =1$) whereas $\mu$ is the Hausdorff measure of a compact $d$-set $\Gamma$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $0&lt;d&lt;n$. This extends previous assertions for the positive-definite selfadjoint fractal differential operator $(\mathrm{id} - \Delta)^{\sigma/2} \mu$ based on Hilbert space arguments in the context of suitable Sobolev spaces $H^s (\mathbb{R}^n) = B^s_2 (\mathbb{R}^n)$. We collect the outcome in the {Main Theorem} below. Proofs are based on estimates for the entropy numbers of the compact trace operator \[ \mathrm{tr}_\mu: \quad B^s_p (\mathbb{R}^n) \hookrightarrow L_p (\Gamma, \mu), \quad s&gt;0, \quad 1&lt;p&lt;\infty. \] We add at the end of the paper a few personal reminiscences illuminating the role of Pietsch in connection with the creation of approximation numbers and entropy numbers.</description>

      <title>On asymptotic B-convexity and infratype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce and study the notions of asymptotic B-convexity and asymptotic infratype $p$, and we prove asymptotic analogs of a series of results due to Giesy \cite{Giesy66} and Pisier \cite{Pisier74}. In particular, we give a simplified proof of an asymptotic version of Pisier's $\ell_1$-theorem that was originally proven by Causey, Draga, and Kochanek in \cite{CDK19}. We also briefly discuss the notion of asymptotic stable type.</description>

Abstract: We study the convergence of the Hermite series of measurable functions on the real line. We characterize the norm convergence of truncated partial Hermite sums in rearrangement invariant spaces provided that the truncations vanish sufficiently slowly.

      <title>Generalized Volterra-type integral operators between Bloch-type spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Volterra-type integral operator plays an essential role in modern complex analysis and operator theory. Recently, Chalmoukis \cite{Cn} introduced a generalized integral operator, say $I_{g,a}$, defined by $$I_{g,a}f=I^n(a_0f^{(n-1)}g'+a_1f^{(n-1)}g''+\cdots+a_{n-1}fg^{(n)}),$$ where $g\in H(\mathbb{D})$ and $a=(a_0,a_1,\cdots,a_{n-1})\in \mathbb{C}^n$. $I^n$ is the $n$th iteration of the integral operator $I$. In this paper, we introduce a more generalized integral operators $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ that cover $I_{g,a}$ on the Bloch-type space $\mathcal{B}^{\alpha}$, defined by $$I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}f=I^n(fg_0+\cdots+f^{(n-1)}g_{n-1}).$$ We show the rigidity of the operator $I_{\mathbf{g}}^{(n)}$ and further the sum $\sum_{i=1}^nI_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}$, where $I_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}f=I^{N_i}(f^{(k_i)}g_i)$. Specifically, the boundedness and compactness of $\sum_{i=1}^nI_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}$ are equal to those of each $I_{g_i}^{N_i,k_i}$. Moreover, the boundedness and compactness of $I^n((fg')^{(n-1)})$ are independent of $n$ when $\alpha&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>The hierarchies of identities and closed products for multiple complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider infinite $\Z_\Z$-index complexes $\mathcal C$ of spaces with elements depending on a number of parameters, complete with respect to a linear associative regular inseparable multilinear product. The existence of nets of vanishing ideals of orders of and powers of differentials is assumed for subspaces of $\mathcal C$-spaces. In the polynomial case of orders and powers of the differentials, we derive the hierarchies of differential identities and closed multiple products. We prove that a set of maximal orders and powers for differentials, differential conditions, together with coherence conditions on indices of a complex $\mathcal C$ elements generate families of multi-graded differential algebras.</description>

      <title>The complete Pick property for pairs of kernels and Shimorin's factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{H}_k, \mathcal{H}_{\ell})$ be a pair of Hilbert function spaces with kernels $k, \ell$. In a 2005 paper, Shimorin showed that a certain factorization condition on $(k, \ell)$ yields a commutant lifting theorem for multipliers $\mathcal{H}_k\to\mathcal{H}_{\ell}$, thus unifying and extending previous results due to Ball-Trent-Vinnikov and Volberg-Treil. Our main result is a strong converse to Shimorin's theorem for a large class of holomorphic pairs $(k, \ell),$ which leads to a full characterization of the complete Pick property for such pairs. We also present an alternative, short proof of sufficiency for Shimorin's condition. Finally, we establish necessary conditions for abstract pairs $(k, \ell)$ to satisfy the complete Pick property, further generalizing Shimorin's work with proofs that are new even in the single-kernel case $k=\ell.$ Shimorin's approach differs from ours in that we do not work with the Nevanlinna-Pick problem directly; instead, we are able to extract vital information for $(k, \ell)$ through Carath\'eodory-Fej\'er interpolation.</description>

      <title>Eventually positive semigroups: spectral and asymptotic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral theory of semigroup generators is a crucial tool for analysing the asymptotic properties of operator semigroups. Typically, Tauberian theorems, such as the ABLV theorem, demand extensive information about the spectrum to derive convergence results. However, the scenario is significantly simplified for positive semigroups on Banach lattices. This observation extends to the broader class of eventually positive semigroups -- a phenomenon observed in various concrete differential equations. In this paper, we investigate the spectral and asymptotic properties of eventually positive semigroups, focusing particularly on the persistently irreducible case. Our findings expand upon the existing theory of eventual positivity, offering new insights into the cyclicity of the peripheral spectrum and asymptotic trends. Notably, several arguments for positive operators and semigroups do not apply in our context, necessitating the use of ultrapower arguments to circumvent these challenges.</description>

      <title>A generalised mid summability in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the notion of mid summability in a general setting using the duality theory of sequence spaces. We define the vector valued sequence space $\lambda^{mid}(X)$ corresponding to a Banach space $X$ and sequence space $\lambda$. We prove that $\lambda^{mid}(\cdot)$ can be placed in a chain with the vector valued sequence spaces $\lambda^{s}(\cdot)$ and $\lambda^{w}(\cdot)$. Consequently, we define mid $\lambda$-summing operators and obtain the maximality of these operator ideals for a suitably restricted $\lambda$. Furthermore, we define a tensor norm using the vector valued sequence spaces $\lambda^{s}(\cdot)$ and $\lambda^{mid}(\cdot)$, and establish its correspondence with the operator ideal of absolutely mid $\lambda$-summing operators.</description>

      <title>Frames generated by graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frames are the most natural generalization of orthonormal bases that allow the inclusion of redundant systems. In this article, we introduce the concept of frames generated by graphs in finite-dimensional spaces and study their properties. Let $G$ be a simple graph of $n$ vertices with Laplacian matrix $L$. We define the notions of $G(n,k)$-frames and $L_G(n,k)$-frames associated with the graph $G$. We obtain the family of dual frames of $L_G(n,k)$-frames and $G(n,k)$-frames. It is shown that non-regular graphs cannot generate tight frames. Then we establish a characterization of tight $G(n,k)$-frames in terms of the adjacency spectra of regular graphs. Besides, we provide a frame theoretic proof of an existing graph property. Finally, we show that one can use complete graphs to generate tight frames.</description>

      <title>Biframes and some of their properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, frame multipliers, pair frames, and controlled frames have been investigated to improve the numerical efficiency of iterative algorithms for inverting the frame operator and other applications of frames. In this paper, the concept of biframe is introduced for a Hilbert space. A biframe is a pair of sequences in a Hilbert space that applies to an inequality similar to frame inequality. Also, it can be regarded as a generalization of controlled frames and a special kind of pair frames. The basic properties of biframes are investigated based on the biframe operator. Then, biframes are classified based on the type of their constituent sequences. In particular, biframes for which one of the constituent sequences is an orthonormal basis $\{e_k\}_{k=1}^\infty$ are studied. Then, a new class of Riesz bases denoted by $[\{e_k\}]$, is introduced and is called b-Riesz bases. An interesting result is also proved, showing that the set of all b-Riesz bases is a proper subset of the set of all Riesz bases. More precisely, b-Riesz bases induce an equivalence relation on $[\{e_k\}]$.</description>

      <title>Iterates of composition operators on global spaces of ultradifferentiable functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of the iterates of composition operators defined by polynomials acting on global classes of ultradifferentiable functions of Beurling type and being invariant under Fourier transform. We characterize the polynomials $\psi$ for which the sequence of iterates is equicontinuous between two different Gelfand-Shilov spaces. For the particular case in which the weight $\omega$ is equivalent to a power of the logarithm, the result obtained characterizes the polynomials $\psi$ for which the composition operator $C_\psi$ is power bounded in ${\mathcal S}_\omega({\mathbb R}).$ Unlike the composition operators in Schwartz class, the Waelbroek spectrum of an operator $C_\psi$, being $\psi$ a polynomial of degree greater than one lacking fixed points is never compact. We focus on the problem of convergence of Neumann series. We deduce the continuity of the resolvent operator between two different Gelfand-Shilov classes for polynomials $\psi$ lacking fixed points. Concerning polynomials of second degree the most interesting case is the one in which the polynomial only has one fixed point: we provide some restrictions on the indices $d, d'$ that are necessary for the resolvent operator to be continuous between the Gelfand-Shilov classes $\Sigma_d$ and $\Sigma_{d'}.$</description>

For a concrete example of the potential, we give a more explicit index formula, showing that the Witten index assumes any real number on this class of operators.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Mond-Pecaric Method with Applications to Hypercomplex Function Sobolev Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mond and Pecaric introduced a method to simplify the determination of complementary inequalities for Jensen's inequality by converting it into a single-variable maximization or minimization problem of continuous functions. This principle has significantly enriched the field of operator inequalities. Our contribution lies in extending the Mond-Pecaric method from single-input operators to multiple-input operators. We commence by defining normalized positive linear maps, accompanied by illustrative examples. Subsequently, we employ the Mond-Pecaric method to derive fundamental inequalities for multivariate hypercomplex functions bounded by linear functions. These foundational inequalities serve as the basis for establishing several multivariate hypercomplex function inequalities, focusing on ratio relationships. Additionally, we present similar results based on difference relationships. Finally, we apply the derived multivariate hypercomplex function inequalities to establish Sobolev embedding via Sobolev inequality for hypercomplex functions with operator inputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative stability results for different classes of Sobolev inequalities on general compact Riemannian manifolds. We prove that, up to constants depending on the manifold, a function that nearly saturates a critical Sobolev inequality is quantitatively $W^{1,2}$-close to a non-empty set of extremal functions, provided that the corresponding optimal Sobolev constant satisfies a suitable strict bound. The case of sub-critical Sobolev inequalities is also covered. Finally, we discuss degenerate phenomena in our quantitative controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several recent articles in operator algebras make a nontrivial use of the theory of measurable fields of von Neumann algebras $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ and related structures. This includes the associated field $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ of automorphism groups and more general measurable fields of Polish groups with actions on Polish spaces. Nevertheless, a fully rigorous and at the same time sufficiently broad and flexible theory of such Borel fields and measurable fields is not available in the literature. We fill this gap in this paper and include a few counterexamples to illustrate the subtlety: for instance, for a Borel field $(M_x)_{x \in X}$ of von Neumann algebras, the field of Polish groups $(\text{Aut}\ M_x)_{x \in X}$ need not be Borel.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of distributional $k$-forms on $d$-dimensional manifolds which can be integrated against suitably regular $k$-submanifolds. Our approach combines ideas from Whitney's geometric integration [Whi57] with those of sewing approaches to rough integration [Gub04, FdLP06].</description>

      <title>Approximation processes by multidimensional Bernstein-type exponential polynomials on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new family of Bernstein-type exponential polynomials on the hypercube $[0, 1]^d$ and study their approximation properties. Such operators fix a multidimensional version of the exponential function and its square. In particular, we prove uniform convergence, by means of two different approaches, as well as a quantitative estimate of the order of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity of the approximated function.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to the weak Shanks conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an example of a function $f$ non-vanishing in the closed bidisk and the affine polynomial minimizing the norm of $1-pf$ in the Hardy space of the bidisk among all affine polynomials $p$. We show that this polynomial vanishes inside the bidisk. This provides a counterexample to the weakest form of a conjecture due to Shanks that has been open since 1980, with applications that arose from digital filter design. This counterexample has a simple form and follows naturally from [7], where the phenomenon of zeros seeping into the unit disk was already observed for similar minimization problems in one variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a locally compact second countable group equipped with an admissible non-degenerate Borel probability measure $\mu$. We generalize the notion of $\mu$-stationary systems to $\mu$-stationary $G$-factor maps $\pi: (X,\nu)\to (Y,\eta)$. For these stationary relations between dynamical systems, we provide a structure theorem, which generalizes the structure theorem of Furstenberg-Glasner. Furthermore, we show the existence and uniqueness of a relative version of the Poisson boundary in this setup.</description>

Abstract: Given a separable, AF-algebra A and an inductive limit action on A of a finitely generated abelian group with finite Rokhlin dimension with commuting towers, we give a local description of the associated crossed product C*-algebra. In particular, when A is unital and $\alpha \in Aut(A)$ is approximately inner and has the Rokhlin property, we conclude that $A \rtimes_{\alpha} \mathbb{Z}$ is an A$\mathbb{T}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the Daugavet Property for Complex Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the Daugavet property and the diametral diameter two properties in complex Banach spaces. The characterizations for both Daugavet and $\Delta$-points are revisited in the context of complex Banach spaces. We also provide relationships between some variants of alternative convexity and smoothness, nonsquareness, and the Daugavet property. As a consequence, every strongly locally uniformly alternatively convex or smooth (sluacs) Banach space does not contain $\Delta$-points from the fact that such spaces are locally uniformly nonsquare. We also study the convex diametral local diameter two property (convex-DLD2P) and the polynomial Daugavet property in the vector-valued function space $A(K, X)$. From an explicit computation of the polynomial Daugavetian index of $A(K, X)$, we show that the space $A(K, X)$ has the polynomial Daugavet property if and only if either the base algebra $A$ or the range space $X$ has the polynomial Daugavet property. Consequently, we obtain that the polynomial Daugavet property, the Daugavet property, the diameteral diameter two properties, and the property ($\mathcal{D}$) are equivalent for infinite-dimensional uniform algebras.</description>

      <title>New Results in Analysis of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence of closed vector subspaces (i.e.spaceability) in various nonlinear subsets of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces $\Lambda_{\varphi,w}$, equipped with the Luxemburg norm. If a family of Orlicz functions $(\varphi_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ satisfies certain order relations with respect to a given Orlicz function $\varphi$, the subset of the order-continuous subspace $(\Lambda_{\varphi,w})_a$ whose elements do not belong to $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}\Lambda_{\varphi_n,w}$ is spaceable, and even maximal-spaceable when $\varphi$ satisfies the $\Delta_2$-condition. We also show that this subset is either residual or empty. In addition, sufficient conditions for this subset not being $(\alpha, \beta)$-spaceable are provided. A similar analysis is also performed on the subset $\Lambda_{\varphi,w} \setminus (\Lambda_{\varphi,w})_a$ when $\varphi$ does not satisfy the $\Delta_2$-condition.
  The comparison between different Orlicz-Lorentz spaces is characterized via the generating pairs $(\varphi,w)$. For a fixed Orlicz function that satisfies the $\Delta_2^{\infty}$-condition, we provide a characterization of disjointly strictly singular inclusion operators between Orlicz-Lorentz spaces with different weights. As a consequence, there are certain subsets of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces on $[0,1]$ for which lineability problem is not valid. Moreover, various types of $(\alpha,\beta)$-lineability and pointwise lineability properties on other nonlinear subsets of Orlicz-Lorentz spaces are examined. These results extend a number of previously known results in Orlicz and Lorentz spaces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of Finite Hankel Transforms and the Surjectivity of Convolution Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compactly supported distribution is called invertible in the sense of Ehrenpreis-H\"ormander if the convolution with it induces a surjection from $\mathcal{C}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ to itself. We give sufficient conditions for radial functions to be invertible. Our analysis is based on the asymptotic expansions of finite Hankel transforms. The dominant term may be the contribution from the origin or from the boundary of the support of the function. For the proof, we propose a new method to calculate the asymptotic expansions of finite Hankel transforms of functions with singularities at a point other than the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study local Sobolev-Poincar\'e imbedding domains. The main result reads as below. \begin{enumerate} \item for $1\leq p\leq n$, a bounded uniform domain is also a local Sobolev-Poincar\'e imbedding domain of order $p$; conversely a local Sobolev-Poincar\'e imbedding domain of order $p$ is locally linearly connected $(LLC)$. A uniform domain is $(LLC)$. Conversely, with some very weak connecting assumption, a $(LLC)$ domain is uniform. \item for $n&lt;p&lt;\fz$, a bounded domain is a local Sobolev-Poincar\'e imbedding domain of order $p$ if and only if it is an $\alpha$-cigar domain for $\alpha=(p-n)/(p-1)$. Hence, a domain is a local Sobolev-Poincar\'e imbedding domain of oder $p$ if and only if it is a (global) Sobolev-Poincar\'e imbedding domain. \end{enumerate}</description>

      <title>Multiplier algebras of $L^p$-operator algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the multiplier algebra of an approximately unital and nondegenerate $L^p$-operator algebra is again an $L^p$-operator algebra. In this paper we investigate examples that drop both hypotheses. In particular, we show that the multiplier algebra of $T_2^p$, the algebra of strictly upper triangular $2 \times 2$ matrices acting on $\ell_2^p$, is still an $L^p$-operator algebra for any $p$. To contrast this result, we first provide a thorough study of the augmentation ideal of $\ell^1(G)$ for a discrete group $G$. We use this ideal to define a family of non approximately unital degenerate $L^p$-operator algebras, $F_{r,0}^p(\Bbb{Z}/3\Bbb{Z})$, whose multiplier algebras cannot be represented on any $L^q$-space for any $q \in [1, \infty)$ as long as $p \in [1, p_0] \cup [p_0', \infty)$, where $p_0=1.606$ and $p_0'$ is its H\"older conjugate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the class of operators $S_{\alpha,\beta}$ obtained by compressing the Hardy shift on the parametric spaces $H^2_{\alpha, \beta}$ corresponding to the pair $\{\alpha,\beta\}$ satisfying $|\alpha|^2+|\beta|^2=1$. We show, for nonzero $\alpha,\beta$, each $S_{\alpha,\beta}$ is indeed a shift $M_z$ on some analytic reproducing kernel Hilbert space and present a complete classification of their invariant subspaces. While all such invariant subspaces $\clm$ are cyclic, we show, unlike other classical shifts, they may not be generated by their corresponding wandering subspaces $(\clm\ominus S_{\alpha,\beta}\clm)$. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition along this line and show, for a certain class of $\alpha, \beta$, there exist $S_{\alpha,\beta}$-invariant subspaces $\clm$ such that $\clm\neq [\clm\ominus S_{\alpha,\beta}\clm]_{S_{\alpha,\beta}}$.</description>

Abstract: The notion of disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for a Furstenberg family $\mathcal{A}$ is introduced with the aim to generalize properties derived from disjoint hypercyclic operators. We begin a systematic study by showing some of the basic properties, including necessary conditions to inherit the property on the whole space from an invariant linearly dense set containing the origin. As a consequence, we continue the study of the link between non-linear and linear dynamics through Lipschitz-free spaces by presenting some necessary conditions to obtain disjoint $\mathcal{A}$-transitivity for families of Lipschitz-free operators on $\mathcal{F}(M)$ expressed in terms of conditions in the underlying metric space $M$.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the extrapolation theory of Rubio de Francia on general function spaces. We present endpoint extrapolation results including $A_1$, $A_p$, and $A_\infty$ extrapolation in the context of Banach function spaces, and also on modular spaces. We also include several applications that can be easily obtained using extrapolation: local decay estimates for various operators, Coifman--Fefferman inequalities that can be used to show some known sharp $A_1$ inequalities, Muckenhoupt--Wheeden and Sawyer's conjectures are also presented for many operators, which go beyond Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators. Finally, we obtain two-weight inequalities for Littlewood--Paley operators and Fourier integral operators on weighted Banach function spaces.</description>

That is, if a bi-parameter singular integral operator $T$ admits the compact full and partial kernel representations, and satisfies the weak compactness property, the diagonal $\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, and the product $\mathrm{CMO}$ condition, then $T$ can be extended to a compact operator on $L^p(w)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ and $w \in A_p(\mathbb{R}^{n_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_2})$. Even in the unweighted setting, it is the first time to give a compact extension of Journ\'{e}'s $T1$ theorem on product spaces.</description>

Finally, we use a theorem of Sierakowski to show that, for an action with finite Rokhlin dimension, every ideal in the associated reduced crossed product C*-algebra arises from an invariant ideal of the underlying algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a characterization of when two expansive matrices yield the same anisotropic local Hardy and inhomogeneous Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The characterization is in terms of the coarse equivalence of certain quasi-norms associated to the matrices. For nondiagonal matrices, these conditions are strictly weaker than those classifying the coincidence of the corresponding homogeneous function spaces. The obtained results complete the classification of anisotropic Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces associated to general expansive matrices.</description>

Abstract: We introduce functional Wulff shapes based on the classical construction for compact convex sets. With this new tool, we establish a functional version of Aleksandrov's variational lemma in the family of convex functions with compact domain. The resulting formula is then applied to evaluate the first variation of a class of functionals on convex functions. In particular, we extend a recent result by Huang, Liu, Xi, and Zhao.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stabilization problem of a generalized thermoelastic system (the so called $\alpha-\beta$ system) with delay in a part of the coupled system. For each case, we prove the well-posedness of the corresponding system using semigroup approach, then under some sufficient conditions we establish some results of exponential and polynomial stability of the system through a frequency-domain approach. The results are applied to concrete examples in thermoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Schauder frames of discrete translates in $L^p(\mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $p &gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ we construct a uniformly discrete real sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ with $|\lambda_{n+1}| &gt; |\lambda_n|$, a function $g \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$, and continuous linear functionals $\{g^*_n\}$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, such that every $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ admits a series expansion \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} g_n^*(f) g(x-\lambda_n) \] convergent in the $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ norm. We also prove a similar result for the space $C_0(\mathbb{R})$, where in this case $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ is taken to be the sequence of positive integers.</description>

      <title>Extended Flow Matching: a Method of Conditional Generation with Generalized Continuity Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18839v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of conditional generation is one of the most important applications of generative models, and numerous methods have been developed to date based on the celebrated flow-based models. However, many flow-based models in use today are not built to allow one to introduce an explicit inductive bias to how the conditional distribution to be generated changes with respect to conditions. This can result in unexpected behavior in the task of style transfer, for example. In this research, we introduce extended flow matching (EFM), a direct extension of flow matching that learns a ``matrix field'' corresponding to the continuous map from the space of conditions to the space of distributions. We show that we can introduce inductive bias to the conditional generation through the matrix field and demonstrate this fact with MMOT-EFM, a version of EFM that aims to minimize the Dirichlet energy or the sensitivity of the distribution with respect to conditions. We will present our theory along with experimental results that support the competitiveness of EFM in conditional generation.</description>

      <title>Some super-Poincar\'e inequalities for gaussian-like measures on stratified Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the $U$-bound program initiated in [J. Funct. Anal. 258, 814-851 (2010)] and prove super-Poincar\'e inequalities for a class of subelliptic probability measures defined on M\'etivier groups, the main ingredient in the proof being a Hardy-type inequality. In doing so, we recover and extend some previous results from the probabilistic viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Layers of planar hexagonal heterostructure modeled by quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work presents a study on the quantum theory of periodic graphs applied to mono- and bilayer hexagonal materials. Different parameters associated with the atoms present at the vertices of these materials were analyzed, verifying the existence of gaps in the spectral bands and expressing the width of these openings according to the parameters. The study was extended to heterostructures with mixed layers and "sandwiches" of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride. The dispersion relationships obtained in these models were analyzed and it was concluded that the inclusion of hBN layers on graphene layers can induce a gap in the graphene. Furthermore, it was observed that the inclusion of a single layer of graphene between two layers of hBN reduces the width of the spectral gap. The interaction between carbon atoms and nitrogen and boron atoms was pointed out as responsible for these results. Finally, the inclusion of a magnetic field in the hBN layer was considered, demonstrating that specific values of magnetic flux can eliminate conical touches in the dispersion relation of the operator and ensure the existence of gaps.</description>
