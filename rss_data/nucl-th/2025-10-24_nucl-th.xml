      <title>Computing nuclear response functions with time-dependent coupled-cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute nuclear response functions by solving the time-dependent A-body Schr\"odinger equation, recording the time-dependent transition moment and extracting spectral information via Fourier transforms. The solution of the time-dependent many-body problem accounts for correlations on top of the mean field by taking advantage of a time-dependent formulation of coupled-cluster theory. As a validation, we focus on electric dipole transitions in $^4$He and $^{16}$O and compare moments of the response function distribution to the results of an equivalent static framework, finding negligible discrepancies. We investigate how proton and neutron densities evolve in time, and we see the traditional picture of soft and giant dipole resonances as collective oscillations of protons and neutrons emerging from our calculations in $^{16}$O and $^{24}$O. This method also allows us to investigate the behavior of the nucleus in the presence of a strong electric field. In that regime, the behavior of the system becomes chaotic. Qualitatively, the spectral information obtained in this limit is in line with previous time-dependent mean-field results.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Fragmentation at the Future Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate aspects of low-energy nuclear reactions that could be explored at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory and compare them with analogous measurements performed in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The estimated fragmentation cross sections at the EIC are roughly three orders of magnitude smaller than those observed at the LHC. At the LHC, uranium nucleus fragmentation exhibits a distinctive double-peaked mass spectrum arising from fission processes, whereas at the EIC, the breakup pattern is mainly characterized by neutron evaporation and a vastly reduced yield of fission fragments, about four orders of magnitude fewer events in comparison.</description>

      <title>Probing Neutron Skin through Event-by-Event Pion Asymmetry in Heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for probing the neutron skin thickness of gold (Au) by analyzing the event-by-event distribution of $\pi^{-}$ and $\pi^{+}$ yield differences. This is achieved through SMASH simulations of ultra-peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=3$ GeV. Our results demonstrate that the mean value of $\Delta n_{\pi} = n_{\pi^{-}} - n_{\pi^{+}}$, along with the Pearson correlation and mutual information between $(\pi^{-}+\pi^{+})$ and $(\pi^{-}-\pi^{+})$, all scale linearly with the neutron skin thickness. Moreover, the slope of the line connecting two distinct $\Delta n_{\pi}$ values in the event-by-event distribution also exhibits a linear dependence on the neutron skin thickness. The most sensitive $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs are identified as $(-1, 1)$, $(-1, 2)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(0, 2)$. These findings establish a new pathway for determining the neutron skin thickness. Finally, by comparing SMASH and UrQMD simulations under identical initial conditions, we observe that individual slope values depend on the specific collision model. However, by extracting slopes from multiple $\Delta n_{\pi}$ pairs in experimental event-by-event data and inferring the corresponding neutron skin thickness, one can assess which model better aligns with the true physical value.</description>

      <title>Data-driven exploration of the neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap using Cassiopeia A neutron star observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to elucidate whether the PBF process alone (i.e., without invoking other processes like direct Urca) can explain the observed rapid cooling of Cas~A NS, by incorporating the significant uncertainties in both $q$ and the $^{3}\text{P}_{2}$ pairing gap function into an optimization of cooling models against the Cas~A NS data. To this end, we introduce a novel parametrization of the pairing gap, in which each parameter has a direct physical meaning, and perform systematic parameter-space exploration with the BSk24 equation of state (EoS). Using a newly-developed Fortran-based cooling code coupled to Optuna's TPE algorithm, we conduct both single-objective ($\chi^2$ only) and multi-objective ($\chi^2$ + slope difference) optimizations under identical conditions. By optimizing the neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap parameters to best reproduce the Cas~A NS observational data during repeated neutron-star cooling simulations, we obtain reasonably-behaving neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap functions with maximum values of $\Delta_\text{max}\approx$\,0.5--0.6\,MeV. Fixing $M=1.4\,M_\odot$, increasing $q$ progressively drives the optimized gap and the critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ profiles toward smoother, more traditional shapes and improves agreement with the observational data; the PBF efficiency factor of $q\gtrsim0.4$ reproduces the Cas~A NS slope well, whereas $q\simeq0.19$ remains insufficient. Our results support previous indications that enhanced PBF efficiency or additional rapid-cooling channels may be required to fully explain the Cas~A NS observational data. The new parametrization not only improves interpretability but also provides a framework for future Bayesian inference and machine-learning applications. Extensions of this work will further advance the systematic study of dense-matter physics with neutron-star cooling. (Shortened due to the arXiv words limit.)</description>

      <title>Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the explodability of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, astrophysical observations have placed tight constraints on key properties of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Using 45 two-dimensional simulations for three different EoS compatible with the current tight constraints, we show that the EoS remains a major uncertainty for the outcome of core-collapse supernovae. Whereas explosions are obtained in most cases for the SFHo and SFHx EoS, for the CMF EoS, which includes a crossover from nucleonic matter to a quark phase, explosions occur only for 2 out of 15 progenitors. Less favourable conditions for neutrino-driven explosions arise for the CMF EoS due to lower neutrino luminosities and mean energies and slightly weaker contraction of the warm proto-neutron star. Our results suggest that the explodability of massive stars cannot yet be predicted based on first principles without better knowledge of the nuclear EoS. Conversely, observational constraints on stellar explodability may help further constrain the EoS.</description>

      <title>Probing the Three-dimension Emission Source and Neutron Skin via $\pi$-$\pi$ Correlations in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Richardson-Lucy algorithm is applied to reconstruct the three-dimensional source function of identical pions from their two-particle correlation functions. The algorithm's performance is first evaluated through simulations with Gaussian-type initial source functions. Its imaging quality and robustness are further demonstrated with experimental data from Au+Au collisions at 1.23 A GeV, collected by the HADES Collaboration. Additionally, using UrQMD simulations of Pb+Pb collisions at 1.5 A GeV, we show that the deblurred source functions exhibit sensitivity to the initial neutron skin thickness of the colliding nuclei. This highlights the potential of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm as a tool for probing the neutron density distribution in heavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Microphysical Probe of Neutron Star Interiors: Constraining the Equation of State with Glitch Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glitches in neutron stars originate from the sudden transfer of angular momentum between superfluid components and the observable crust. By modeling this glitch dynamics, including vortex motion, mutual friction, and angular momentum exchange, we can probe the dense matter equation of state. We match theoretical predictions of glitch rise times, overshoot patterns, and relaxation timescales to the well-documented observations of the 2016 Vela glitch. Our model incorporates microphysical parameters such as the mutual friction coefficient $\mathcal{B}$, which in the core arises from electron scattering off magnetized vortices, and in the crust from Kelvin wave excitation during vortex-lattice interactions. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis of the timing residuals reveals detailed glitch dynamics: the crustal superfluid couples on timescales of $\sim100$ seconds, the core exhibits overshoot behavior due to strong central behavior, and the inner crust shows weak entrainment, with $\sim70\%$ of free neutrons remaining superfluid. The modeled rise times are consistent with the observed upper limit of 12.6 seconds, and the observed overshoot requires strong crustal friction but weak core friction, supporting a spatially varying $\mathcal{B}$.These findings highlight the importance of microphysical modeling and demonstrate the potential of future high-cadence timing observations to further constrain the internal dynamics and composition of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Parity-doubled nucleons can rapidly cool neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In confined hadronic matter, the spontaneous breaking and restoration of chiral symmetry can be described by considering nucleons, $N_{+}(939)$, and excited states of opposite parity, $N_{-}(1535)$. In a cold, dense hadronic phase where chiral symmetry remains spontaneously broken, direct Urca decay processes involving the $N_{-}$ are possible, e.g. $N_- \rightarrow N_+ + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$. We show that at low temperature and moderate densities, because the $N_-$ is much heavier than the $N_+$, such cooling dominates over standard $N_+$ direct Urca processes. This provides a strong astrophysical signature of the pattern of chiral symmetry restoration in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Charge symmetry breaking effect in mirror {\Lambda} hypernuclei with Skyrme-Hartree-Fock model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the charge symmetry breaking (CSB) effect in mirror hypernuclei using the deformed Skyrme Hartree-Fock (DSHF)+ Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) model together with the CSB term and pairing interaction. Our model provides good account for the observations of CSB effect in mirror hypernuclei in the mass region of A = 7~16. We investigate the effect of deformation on the single-Lambda binding energy differences and we found that, in mirror hypernuclei with mass numbers A = 8 and A = 9, deformation has a noticeable impact on the energy difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In these notes the Born series for the $s$-wave scattering $a_0$ is calculated for a class of central potentials $V(r)$ up to sixth order in a dimensionless coupling strength $g$. Examples of exponentially decaying potentials as well truncated potentials involving a single length-scale $a$ are considered. In certain favorable cases the exact result for the $g$-dependent $s$-wave scattering length $a_0=A_0(g) a$ can be given in terms of special functions. The poles of $A_0(g)$ at increasing positive values of $g$ correspond to the thresholds, where $s$-wave bound-states occur successively. A scattering problem, where $A_0(g)$ is solvable in terms of elementary functions, is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16313v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of symmetry restoration on nuclear beta decay within the axially deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA). We employ the proton-neutron finite-amplitude method (pnFAM) to compute transition amplitudes, and perform angular-momentum projection both after variation and after the QRPA to restore rotational symmetry. Exact projection reduces the calculated beta decay half-lives from those that use the needle approximation by up to 60%, and even more when taking the effects of projection on the ground-state energy into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The photon radiation induced by rescattering in a magnetized medium is investigated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet propagating a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies in this process. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate an experimental comparison of photon yields from quark-gluon plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling for Identified Mesons and Baryons: Insights into Medium Transport Properties, Equation of State and Hadronic Re-scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaling functions for the centrality and transverse momentum dependence of \(v_2(p_T,\text{cent})\) and \(v_3(p_T,\text{cent})\) are constructed for identified mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb (\(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76,\ 5.02\)~TeV), Xe+Xe (5.44~TeV), and Au+Au (0.2~TeV) collisions. These species-resolved functions capture the interplay of initial geometry, viscous attenuation, radial flow, partonic energy loss, and hadronic re-scattering across both flow- and quenching-dominated regimes. The systematic growth of the radial-flow parameter \(\zeta_{\rm rf}\) with multiplicity and beam energy provides direct empirical constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of hot QCD matter. The extracted parameters also yield differential constraints on the specific shear viscosity \(\eta/s\), the jet-quenching parameter \(\hat{q}\), and late-stage hadronic dynamics. LHC systems exhibit low \(\eta/s\), strong radial flow, and negligible re-scattering at high energy density, whereas Au+Au at RHIC energy shows even lower \(\eta/s\), weaker radial flow, finite re-scattering, and reduced energy density. The coexistence of strong radial flow at low \(p_T\) and significant jet suppression at high \(p_T\) emerges as a defining hallmark of QGP formation, establishing the framework as a quantitative probe of QGP transport properties and EOS stiffness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimental search for CP violation in paramagnetic atomic and molecular systems has made impressive progress in recent years. This has led to strong upper limits on the electron electric dipole moment. The same measurements can also be used to constrain hadronic sources of CP violation through CP-violating interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. We employ heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory to compute such CP-violating semileptonic electron-nucleus interactions arising from the QCD theta term. We sharpen earlier results by determining the relevant short-distance effects and by an explicit two-loop calculation of meson-photon diagrams. We derive a bound of $|\bar{\theta}| &lt; 1.5 \cdot 10^{-8}$ at $90\%$ confidence, based on HfF$^+$ experiments at JILA. A further experimental improvement of one to two orders of magnitude would make paramagnetic molecular electric dipole moment experiments competitive with the neutron and diamagnetic atom program in constraining strong CP violation and higher-dimensional CP-odd quark-gluon operators.</description>

Abstract: Most atomic nuclei exhibit ellipsoidal shapes characterized by quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\gamma$, and sometimes even a pear-like octupole deformation $\beta_3$. The STAR experiment introduced a new "imaging-by-smashing" technique [arXiv:2401.06625, arXiv:2501.16071] to image the nuclear global shape by colliding nuclei at ultra-relativistic speeds and analyzing outgoing debris. Features of nuclear shape manifest in collective observables like anisotropic flow $v_n$ and radial flow via mean transverse momentum $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$. We present new measurements of the variances of $v_n$ ($n=2$, 3, and 4) and $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, and the covariance of $v_n^2$ with $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$, in collisions of highly deformed $^{238}$U and nearly spherical $^{197}$Au. Ratios of these observables between the two systems effectively suppress common final-state effects, isolating the strong impact of uranium's deformation. By comparing results with state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model calculations, we extract $\beta_{2\mathrm{U}}$ and $\gamma_{\mathrm{U}}$ values consistent with those deduced from low-energy nuclear structure measurements. Measurements of $v_3$ and its correlation with $[p_{\mathrm{T}}]$ also provide the first experimental suggestion of a possible octupole deformation for $^{238}$U. These findings provide significant support for using high-energy collisions to explore nuclear shapes on femtosecond timescales, with implications for both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma studies.</description>

Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon: quark and gluon quantum information localizes on a transverse entangling two-sphere of radius $R_{EE}$, where the QCD vacuum -- partitioned by a hadron into interior and exterior regions -- reaches maximal entanglement. Lattice-QCD determinations of the scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{EE}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{EE})$, yielding a parameter-free slope $c_h = 8\pi^2 R_{EE}^2 \rho_h(R_{EE})$ and a mechanical entropy $S_{EE}(y) = c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The entropy gradient $\partial_{R}S_{EE}$ changes sign at $R_{EE}$, pushing colored fields outward for $r &lt; R_{EE}$ and pulling them inward for $r &gt; R_{EE}$, thereby localizing them on the codimension-2 two-sphere $\Sigma_\perp = S^{2}_{R_{EE}}$ (which projects onto the transverse plane in the infinite-momentum frame). This furnishes a high-energy (large-$y$) diagnostic that complements -- rather than replaces -- the Wilson-loop area-law criterion in the infrared. Imposing unitarity on an entropic eikonal ansatz gives $\sigma(s) \propto y^{\delta}$: world data favor $\delta = 2$ for elastic $pp$ and heavy-quark photoproduction, while $\phi$ photoproduction prefers $\delta = 0.387$. All extracted cross sections remain well below the Froissart-Martin bound. Altogether, the framework quantifies a confinement criterion directly from nonperturbative QCD inputs, linking the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative picture.</description>
