      <title>A Note on Mathai's Entropy Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a paper [8] the authors classify entropy into three categories, as a thermodynamics quantity, as a measure of information production, and as a means of statistical inference. An entropy measure introduced by Mathai falls into the second and third categories. It is shown that this entropy measure is the same whether the variables involved are real or complex scalar, vector, or matrix variables. If the entropy measure is optimized under some moment-like conditions then one can obtain various types of densities which are applicable in different areas. Unlike Tsallis' entropy [9], it does not need an intermediary escort distribution to yield the desired results. Calculus of variation can be directly applied to obtain the desired results under Mathai's entropy. Tsallis' entropy, which is the basis of the area of non-extensive statistical mechanics, is a modified version of the ?-generalized entropy of Havrda-Charvat considered in [7]. Various types of distributions that can be obtained through optimization of Mathai's entropy, are illustrated in this paper.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Vicsek Model Meets DBSCAN: Cluster Phases in the Vicsek Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model, which was originally proposed to explain the dynamics of bird flocking, exhibits a phase transition with respect to the absolute value of the mean velocity. Although clusters of agents can be easily observed via numerical simulations of the Vicsek model, qualitative studies are lacking. We study the clustering structure of the Vicsek model by applying DBSCAN, a recently-introduced clustering algorithm, and report that the Vicsek model shows a phase transition with respect to the number of clusters: from O(N) to O(1), with N being the number of agents, when increasing the magnitude of noise for a fixed radius that specifies the interaction of the Vicsek model. We also report that the combination of the order parameter proposed by Vicsek et al. and the number of clusters defines at least four phases of the Vicsek model.</description>

      <title>Decomposing force fields as flows on graphs reconstructed from stochastic trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disentangling irreversible and reversible forces from random fluctuations is a challenging problem in the analysis of stochastic trajectories measured from real-world dynamical systems. We present an approach to approximate the dynamics of a stationary Langevin process as a discrete-state Markov process evolving over a graph-representation of phase-space, reconstructed from stochastic trajectories. Next, we utilise the analogy of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition of an edge-flow on a contractible simplicial complex with the associated decomposition of a stochastic process into its irreversible and reversible parts. This allows us to decompose our reconstructed flow and to differentiate between the irreversible currents and reversible gradient flows underlying the stochastic trajectories. We validate our approach on a range of solvable and nonlinear systems and apply it to derive insight into the dynamics of flickering red-blood cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. In particular, we capture the difference in irreversible circulating currents between healthy and passive cells and healthy and arrhythmic heartbeats. Our method breaks new ground at the interface of data-driven approaches to stochastic dynamics and graph signal processing, with the potential for further applications in the analysis of biological experiments and physiological recordings. Finally, it prompts future analysis of the convergence of the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition in discrete and continuous spaces.</description>
