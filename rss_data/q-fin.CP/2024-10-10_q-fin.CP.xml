      <title>Deep Learning Methods for S Shaped Utility Maximisation with a Random Reference Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the portfolio optimisation problem where the terminal function is an S-shaped utility applied at the difference between the wealth and a random benchmark process. We develop several numerical methods for solving the problem using deep learning and duality methods. We use deep learning methods to solve the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for both the primal and dual problems, and the adjoint equation arising from the stochastic maximum principle. We compare the solution of this non-concave problem to that of concavified utility, a random function depending on the benchmark, in both complete and incomplete markets. We give some numerical results for power and log utilities to show the accuracy of the suggested algorithms.</description>

      <title>Simulating and analyzing a sparse order book: an application to intraday electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel model for simulating and analyzing sparse limit order books (LOBs), with a specific application to the European intraday electricity market. In illiquid markets, characterized by significant gaps between order levels due to sparse trading volumes, traditional LOB models often fall short. Our approach utilizes an inhomogeneous Poisson process to accurately capture the sporadic nature of order arrivals and cancellations on both the bid and ask sides of the book. By applying this model to the intraday electricity market, we gain insights into the unique microstructural behaviors and challenges of this dynamic trading environment. The results offer valuable implications for market participants, enhancing their understanding of LOB dynamics in illiquid markets. This work contributes to the broader field of market microstructure by providing a robust framework adaptable to various illiquid market settings beyond electricity trading.</description>

      <title>Operator Deep Smoothing for Implied Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise a novel method for nowcasting implied volatility based on neural operators. Better known as implied volatility smoothing in the financial industry, nowcasting of implied volatility means constructing a smooth surface that is consistent with the prices presently observed on a given option market. Option price data arises highly dynamically in ever-changing spatial configurations, which poses a major limitation to foundational machine learning approaches using classical neural networks. While large models in language and image processing deliver breakthrough results on vast corpora of raw data, in financial engineering the generalization from big historical datasets has been hindered by the need for considerable data pre-processing. In particular, implied volatility smoothing has remained an instance-by-instance, hands-on process both for neural network-based and traditional parametric strategies. Our general operator deep smoothing approach, instead, directly maps observed data to smoothed surfaces. We adapt the graph neural operator architecture to do so with high accuracy on ten years of raw intraday S&amp;P 500 options data, using a single model instance. The trained operator adheres to critical no-arbitrage constraints and is robust with respect to subsampling of inputs (occurring in practice in the context of outlier removal). We provide extensive historical benchmarks and showcase the generalization capability of our approach in a comparison with classical neural networks and SVI, an industry standard parametrization for implied volatility. The operator deep smoothing approach thus opens up the use of neural networks on large historical datasets in financial engineering.</description>

      <title>QuantFactor REINFORCE: Mining Steady Formulaic Alpha Factors with Variance-bounded REINFORCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of alpha factor mining is to discover indicative signals of investment opportunities from the historical financial market data of assets, which can be used to predict asset returns and gain excess profits. Recently, a promising framework is proposed for generating formulaic alpha factors using deep reinforcement learning, and quickly gained research focuses from both academia and industries. This paper first argues that the originally employed policy training method, i.e., Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), faces several important issues in the context of alpha factors mining, making it ineffective to explore the search space of the formula. Herein, a novel reinforcement learning based on the well-known REINFORCE algorithm is proposed. Given that the underlying state transition function adheres to the Dirac distribution, the Markov Decision Process within this framework exhibit minimal environmental variability, making REINFORCE algorithm more appropriate than PPO. A new dedicated baseline is designed to theoretically reduce the commonly suffered high variance of REINFORCE. Moreover, the information ratio is introduced as a reward shaping mechanism to encourage the generation of steady alpha factors that can better adapt to changes in market volatility. Experimental evaluations on various real assets data show that the proposed algorithm can increase the correlation with asset returns by 3.83\%, and a stronger ability to obtain excess returns compared to the latest alpha factors mining methods, which meets the theoretical results well.</description>

      <title>European Football Player Valuation: Integrating Financial Models and Network Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for player valuation in European football, by fusing principles from financial mathematics and network theory. The valuation model leverages a "passing matrix" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, such as regressing on past performance-salary data, this model focuses on in-game performance as a player's contributions evolve over time. Consequently, our model provides a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. This cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation adapts the effect of connecting pay with performance, first seen in Scully (1974), to include in-game contributions as well as expected present valuation of stochastic variables.</description>

      <title>The Fourier Cosine Method for Discrete Probability Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating that the well-known semi-analytical Fourier cosine (COS) formula for the inverse Fourier transform of continuous probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability distributions, with the help of spectral filters. We establish general convergence rates for these filters and further show that several classical spectral filters achieve convergence rates one order faster than previously recognized in the literature on the Gibbs phenomenon. Our numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical convergence results. Additionally, we illustrate the computational speed and accuracy of the discrete COS method with applications in computational statistics and quantitative finance. The theoretical and numerical results highlight the method's potential for solving problems involving discrete distributions, particularly when the characteristic function is known, allowing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to be bypassed.</description>
