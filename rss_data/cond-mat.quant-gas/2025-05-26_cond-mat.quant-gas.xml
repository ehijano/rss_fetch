      <title>Universal momentum tail of identical one-dimensional anyons with two-body interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-relativistic anyons in 1D possess generalized exchange statistics in which the exchange of two identical anyons generates a non-local phase that is governed by the spatial ordering of the particles and the statistical parameter $\alpha$. Working in the continuum, we demonstrate the existence of two distinct types of 1D anyons, namely bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons. We identify a many-body Hamiltonian with additive two-body zero-range interactions that supports bosonic and fermionic anyon eigenstates, which are, for arbitrary interaction strength, related through a generalized bosonic-anyon--fermionic-anyon mapping, an extension of the celebrated Bose-Fermi mapping for zero-range interacting 1D systems. The momentum distributions of bosonic and fermionic anyons are distinct: while both feature $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ tails, the associated prefactors differ. Our work reveals intricate connections between the generalized exchange statistics, the universal two- and three-body Tan contacts of systems consisting of $N$ identical particles, and the emergence of statistics-induced chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Statistical Localization in a Rydberg Simulator of $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories (LGTs) provide a framework for describing dynamical systems ranging from nuclei to materials. LGTs that host concatenated conservation laws can exhibit Hilbert space fragmentation, where each subspace may be labeled by a conserved quantity with nonlocal operator support. It is expected that nonlocal conservation laws will not impede thermalization locally. However, this expectation has recently been challenged by the notion of statistical localization, wherein particular motifs of microscopic configurations may remain frozen in time due to strong Hilbert space fragmentation. Here, we report the first experimental signatures of statistically-localized behavior. We realize a novel constrained LGT model using a facilitated Rydberg atom array, where atoms mediate the dynamics of electric charge clusters whose nonlocal pattern of net charges remains invariant. By experimentally reconstructing observables sampled from a temporal ensemble, we probe the spatial distribution of each conserved quantity. We find that as a result of strong Hilbert space fragmentation, the expectation values of all conserved quantities remain locally distributed in typical quantum states, even though they are described by nonlocal string-like operators. Our work opens the door to high-energy explorations of cluster dynamics and low-energy studies of strong zero modes that persist in infinite-temperature topological systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional vorticity, Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield systems and complex structures for the (generalized) spinor Gross-Pitaevskii equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The (generalized) Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) for a complex scalar field in two spatial dimensions is analyzed. It is shown that there is an infinite family of self-interaction potentials which admit Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) bounds together with the corresponding first-order BPS systems. For each member of this family, the solutions of the first-order BPS systems are automatically solutions of the corresponding second-order generalized GPE. The simplest topologically non-trivial solutions of these first-order BPS systems describe configurations with quantized fractional vorticity. The corresponding fraction is related to the degree of non-linearity. The case in which the self-interaction potential is of order six (namely $|\Psi |^{6}$, which is a relevant theory both in relativistic quantum field theories in $(2+1)$ dimensions in connection with the quantum Hall effect as well as in the theory of the supersolids) is analyzed in detail. Such formalism can also be extended to the case of quantum mixtures with multi-component GPEs. The relationship between these techniques and supersymmetry will be discussed. In particular, despite several common features, we will show that there are multi-component GPEs that are not supersymmetric (at least, not in the standard sense) and possess a BPS system of the above type.</description>

      <title>Erasure-cooling, control, and hyper-entanglement of motion in optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherently controlling the motion of single atoms in optical tweezers would enable new applications in quantum information science. To demonstrate this, we first prepare atoms in their motional ground state using a species-agnostic cooling mechanism that converts motional excitations into erasures -- errors with a known location. This cooling mechanism fundamentally outperforms idealized traditional sideband cooling, which we experimentally demonstrate. By coherently manipulating the resultant pure motional state, we perform mid-circuit readout and mid-circuit erasure detection via local shelving into motional superposition states. We finally entangle the motion of two atoms in separate tweezers and generate hyper-entanglement by preparing a simultaneous Bell state of motional and optical qubits, unlocking a large new class of quantum operations with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Condensation and prescaling in spatial Polyakov loop correlations far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05582v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The far-from-equilibrium dynamics of spatial Polyakov loop correlations, which provide gauge-invariant observables akin to effective particle numbers for gluon plasmas, are investigated within real-time $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ lattice gauge theory at weak couplings and large gluon occupations. The momentum zero mode of these correlations reveals the dynamic formation of a condensate, while at nonzero momenta, energy is transported toward the ultraviolet. We demonstrate that the non-zero momentum dynamics is well described by a direct cascade in terms of gauge-invariant Polyakov loop excitations, exhibiting self-similar prescaling indicative of a nonthermal attractor. This behavior can be analytically understood through perturbation theory for the Polyakov loop correlations and the established dynamics of gauge field correlations. We perform simulations for both $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge groups, providing further consistency checks on the $N_c$-dependence of perturbative expectations. No evidence of an inverse cascade toward lower momenta is found for momenta above the electric screening scale.</description>

      <title>Probing dielectric breakdown in Mott insulators through current oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric breakdown of mesoscopic Mott insulators, a phenomenon where a strong electric field destabilizes the insulating state, resulting in a transition to a metallic phase. Using the Landau-Zener formalism, which models the excitation of a two-level system, we derive a theoretical expression for the threshold value of the field. To validate our predictions, we present an efficient protocol for estimating the charge gap and threshold field via non-equilibrium current oscillations, overcoming the computational limitations of exact diagonalization. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical formula for systems with small gaps. Moreover, our findings are directly testable in ultracold atomic experiments with ring geometries and artificial gauge fields, as our method uses measurable quantities and relies on already available technologies. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimentally realizable protocols, providing tools to explore non-equilibrium mesoscopic phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.</description>
