      <title>Emergence of second-order coherence in the superradiant emission from a free-space atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of the second-order temporal coherence during the emission of a superradiant burst by an elongated cloud of cold Rb atoms in free space. To do so, we measure the two-times intensity correlation function $g_N^{(2)}(t_1, t_2)$ following the pulsed excitation of the cloud. By monitoring $g_N^{(2)}(t, t)$ during the burst, we observe the establishment of second-order coherence, and contrast it with the situation where the cloud is initially prepared in a steady state. We compare our findings to the predictions of the Dicke model, using an effective atom number to account for finite size effects, finding that the model reproduces the observed trend at early time. For longer times, we observe a subradiant decay, a feature that goes beyond Dicke's model. Finally, we measure the $g_N^{(2)}(t_1, t_2)$ at different times and observe the appearance of anti-correlations during the burst, that are not present when starting from a steady state.</description>

      <title>Analytical Expression for Continuum-continuum Transition Amplitude of Hydrogen-like Atoms with Angular-momentum Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond chronoscopy typically utilises interfering two-photon transitions to access the phase information. Simulating these two-photon transitions is challenging due to the continuum-continuum transition term. The hydrogenic approximation within second-order perturbation theory has been widely used due to the existence of analytical expressions of the wave functions. So far, only (partially) asymptotic results have been derived, which fail to correctly describe the low-kinetic-energy behaviour, especially for high angular-momentum states. Here, we report an analytical expression that overcome these limitations. They are based on the Appell's F1 function and use the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind as the intermediate states. We show that the derived formula quantitatively agrees with the numerical simulations using the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation for various angular-momentum states, which improves the accuracy compared to the other analytical approaches that were previously reported. Furthermore, we give an angular-momentum-dependent asymptotic form of the outgoing wavefunction and their continuum-continuum dipole transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Minimising Interference in Low-Pressure Supersonic Beam Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12628v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-jet atomic, cluster and molecular sources are typically used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. However, understanding and maximising the intensity derived from such sources has proven challenging, partly because of gas interference effects attenuating the beam intensity. Here, we describe a semi-analytic method to estimate the resulting attenuation in low-pressure free-jet sources. We explicitly calculate two contributions to the interference, that arise from the interaction of the beam with (i) background gas and (ii) atoms backscattered from the skimmer. We demonstrate that the design of the skimmer has an insignificant impact for room temperature beams. Finally, we develop a number of design recommendations for the skimmer and vacuum chamber that optimise beam properties for spectroscopy and microscopy when using cryogenic-temperature atom or molecular beams.</description>
