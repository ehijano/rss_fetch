      <title>Modeling Hypergraph Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the advantages of hypergraphs in modeling high-order relationships in complex systems, they have been applied to higher-order clustering, hypergraph neural networks and computer vision. These applications rely heavily on access to high-quality, large-scale real-world hypergraph data. Yet, compared to traditional pairwise graphs, real hypergraph datasets remain scarce in both scale and diversity. This shortage significantly limits the development and evaluation of advanced hypergraph learning algorithms. Therefore, how to quickly generate large-scale hypergraphs that conform to the characteristics of real networks is a crucial task that has not received sufficient attention. Motivated by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), particularly their capabilities in semantic reasoning, structured generation, and simulating human behavior, we investigate whether LLMs can facilitate hypergraph generation from a fundamentally new perspective. We introduce HyperLLM, a novel LLM-driven hypergraph generator that simulates the formation and evolution of hypergraphs through a multi-agent collaboration. The framework integrates prompts and structural feedback mechanisms to ensure that the generated hypergraphs reflect key real-world patterns. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that HyperLLM achieves superior fidelity to structural and temporal hypergraph patterns, while requiring minimal statistical priors. Our findings suggest that LLM-based frameworks offer a promising new direction for hypergraph modeling.</description>

      <title>Celebrity Profiling on Short Urdu Text using Twitter Followers' Feed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of 0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction. These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.</description>

      <title>Evolution of wartime discourse on Telegram: A comparative study of Ukrainian and Russian policymakers' communication before and after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers. Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of online political discourse during times of war.</description>

      <title>Structure-aware Propagation Generation with Large Language Models for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spread of fake news on social media poses a serious threat to public trust and societal stability. While propagation-based methods improve fake news detection by modeling how information spreads, they often suffer from incomplete propagation data. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic propagation, but typically overlooks the structural patterns of real-world discussions. In this paper, we propose a novel structure-aware synthetic propagation enhanced detection (StruSP) framework to fully capture structural dynamics from real propagation. It enables LLMs to generate realistic and structurally consistent propagation for better detection. StruSP explicitly aligns synthetic propagation with real-world propagation in both semantic and structural dimensions. Besides, we also design a new bidirectional evolutionary propagation (BEP) learning strategy to better align LLMs with structural patterns of propagation in the real world via structure-aware hybrid sampling and masked propagation modeling objective. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that StruSP significantly improves fake news detection performance in various practical detection scenarios. Further analysis indicates that BEP enables the LLM to generate more realistic and diverse propagation semantically and structurally.</description>

      <title>CrisisNews: A Dataset Mapping Two Decades of News Articles on Online Problematic Behavior at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As social media adoption grows globally, online problematic behaviors increasingly escalate into large-scale crises, requiring an evolving set of mitigation strategies. While HCI research often analyzes problematic behaviors with pieces of user-generated content as the unit of analysis, less attention has been given to event-focused perspectives that track how discrete events evolve. In this paper, we examine 'social media crises': discrete patterns of problematic behaviors originating and evolving within social media that cause larger-scale harms. Using global news coverage, we present a dataset of 93,250 news articles covering social media-endemic crises from the past 20 years. We analyze a representative subset to classify stakeholder roles, behavior types, and outcomes, uncovering patterns that inform more nuanced classification of social media crises beyond content-based descriptions. By adopting a wider perspective, this research seeks to inform the design of safer platforms, enabling proactive measures to mitigate crises and foster more trustworthy online environments.</description>

      <title>MOUFLON: Multi-group Modularity-based Fairness-aware Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose MOUFLON, a fairness-aware, modularity-based community detection method that allows adjusting the importance of partition quality over fairness outcomes. MOUFLON uses a novel proportional balance fairness metric, providing consistent and comparable fairness scores across multi-group and imbalanced network settings. We evaluate our method under both synthetic and real network datasets, focusing on performance and the trade-off between modularity and fairness in the resulting communities, along with the impact of network characteristics such as size, density, and group distribution. As structural biases can lead to strong alignment between demographic groups and network structure, we also examine scenarios with highly clustered homogeneous groups, to understand how such structures influence fairness outcomes. Our findings showcase the effects of incorporating fairness constraints into modularity-based community detection, and highlight key considerations for designing and benchmarking fairness-aware social network analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Timeliness, Consensus, and Composition of the Crowd: Community Notes on X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first large-scale quantitative analysis of the efficiency of X's Community Notes, a crowdsourced moderation system for identifying and contextualising potentially misleading content. Drawing on over 1.8 million notes, we examine three key dimensions of crowdsourced moderation: participation inequality, consensus formation, and timeliness. Despite the system's goal of collective moderation, we find substantial concentration effect, with the top 10% of contributors producing 58% of all notes (Gini Coefficient = 0.68). The observed consensus is rare-only 11.5% of notes reach agreement on publication, while 69% of posts receive conflicting classifications. A majority of noted posts (approximately 68%) are annotated as "Note Not Needed", reflecting the repurposing of the platform for debate rather than moderation. We found that such posts are paradoxically more likely to yield published notes (OR = 3.12). Temporal analyses show that the notes, on average, are published 65.7 hours after the original post, with longer delays significantly reducing the likelihood of consensus. These results portray Community Notes as a stratified, deliberative system dominated by a small contributor elite, marked by persistent dissensus, and constrained by timeliness. We conclude this study by outlining design strategies to promote equity, faster consensus, and epistemic reliability in community-based moderation.</description>

      <title>The Diameter of (Threshold) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the diameter of threshold (zero temperature) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRG) is $\Theta(\log n)$. This has strong implications for the runtime of many distributed protocols on those graphs, which often have runtimes bounded as a function of the diameter.
  The GIRG model exhibits many properties empirically found in real-world networks, and the runtime of various practical algorithms has empirically been found to scale in the same way for GIRG and for real-world networks, in particular related to computing distances, diameter, clustering, cliques and chromatic numbers. Thus the GIRG model is a promising candidate for deriving insight about the performance of algorithms in real-world instances.
  The diameter was previously only known in the one-dimensional case, and the proof relied very heavily on dimension one. Our proof employs a similar Peierls-type argument alongside a novel renormalization scheme. Moreover, instead of using topological arguments (which become complicated in high dimensions) in establishing the connectivity of certain boundaries, we employ some comparatively recent and clearer graph-theoretic machinery. The lower bound is proven via a simple ad-hoc construction.</description>

      <title>Inclusive Fitness as a Key Step Towards More Advanced Social Behaviors in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically advanced and socially intelligent agents.</description>

      <title>MobileCity: An Efficient Framework for Large-Scale Urban Behavior Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Tony-Yip/MobileCity.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Spread of New Information on Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15370v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been considerable interest in modelling the spread of information on social networks using machine learning models. Here, we consider the problem of predicting the spread of new information, i.e. when a user propagates information about a topic previously unseen by the user. In existing work, information and users are randomly assigned to a test or training set, ensuring that both sets are drawn from the same distribution. In the spread of new information, the problem becomes an out-of-distribution generalisation classification task. Our experimental results reveal that while existing algorithms, which predominantly use features derived from the content of messages, perform well when the training and test distributions are the same, these algorithms perform much worse when the test set is out-of-distribution, i.e. when the topic (hashtag) of the testing data is absent from the training data. We then show that if the message features are supplemented or replaced with features derived from users' profile and past behaviour, the out-of-distribution prediction is greatly improved, with the F1 score increasing from 0.117 to 0.705. Our experimental results suggest that a significant component of reposting behaviour for previously unseen topics can be predicted from users' profile and past behaviour, and is largely content-agnostic.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>From Birdwatch to Community Notes, from Twitter to X: four years of community-based content moderation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Community Notes (formerly known as Birdwatch) is the first large-scale crowdsourced content moderation initiative that was launched by X (formerly known as Twitter) in January 2021. As the Community Notes model gains momentum across other social media platforms, there is a growing need to assess its underlying dynamics and effectiveness. This Resource paper provides (a) a systematic review of the literature on Community Notes, and (b) a major curated dataset and accompanying source code to support future research on Community Notes. We parsed Notes and Ratings data from the first four years of the program and conducted language detection across all Notes. Focusing on English-language Notes, we extracted embedded URLs and identified discussion topics in each Note. Additionally, we constructed monthly interaction networks among the Contributors. Together with the literature review, these resources offer a robust foundation for advancing research on the Community Notes system.</description>
