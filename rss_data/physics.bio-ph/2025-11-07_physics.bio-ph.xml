      <title>Murray's Law as an Entropy-per-Information-Cost Extremum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At steady laminar Y-junctions (Murray family), the observed branching-radius law follows from a single ratio extremum: entropy production per information cost (EPIC). Structure is priced by an effective bit energy Eb,eff = zeta k_B T ln 2 (J per bit); normalizing viscous entropy production by this tariff defines an information-priced entropy flux Phi_b = sigma_s / Eb,eff. Extremizing at fixed demands gives Q proportional to r^alpha with alpha = (m+4)/2 and the node rule r0^alpha = r1^alpha + r2^alpha, where m encodes how the tariff scales with radius (m=2 volume-priced -&gt; alpha = 3; m=1 surface-priced -&gt; alpha = 2.5). Mixed surface/volume pricing implies a local alpha_eff in the range 2.5-3 without changing the fluid physics and leads to a weighted Murray law for heterogeneous tariffs. The ratio extremum is equivalent to an additive functional via fractional programming (Dinkelbach) and reduces, for uniform tariffs, to the familiar near-equilibrium extremum of classical theory (minimum entropy production). The framework is falsifiable: measure how stabilized-bit counts and the overhead zeta scale with radius, and alpha must track (m+4)/2. EPIC recasts branching selection as maximizing entropy throughput per paid bit and provides a platform-agnostic lever to predict and tune morphology.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Dynamics in Biofilms with Time-Varying Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A biofilm is a self-contained community of bacteria that uses signaling molecules called autoinducers (AIs) to coordinate responses through the process of quorum sensing. Biofilms exhibit a dual role that drives interest in both combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and leveraging their potential in bioprocessing, since their products can have commercial potential. Previous work has demonstrated how the distinct anisotropic channel geometry in some biofilms affects AIs propagation therein. In this paper, a 2D anisotropic biofilm channel model is extended to be a time-varying channel (TVC), in order to represent the diffusion dynamics during the maturation phase when water channels develop. Since maturation is associated with the development of anisotropy, the time-varying model captures the shift from isotropic to anisotropic diffusion. Particle-based simulation results illustrate how the TVC is a hybrid scenario incorporating propagation features of both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion. This hybrid behavior aligns with biofilm maturation. Further study of the TVC includes characterization of the mutual information (MI), which reveals that an increased AI count, reduced transmitter -- receiver distance, greater degree of anisotropy, and shorter inter-symbol interference lengths increase the MI. Finally, a brief dimensional analysis demonstrates the scalability of the anisotropic channel results for larger biofilms and timescales.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium dynamics of membraneless active droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Membraneless droplets or liquid condensates formed via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) play a pivotal role in cell biology and hold potential for biomedical engineering. While membraneless droplets are often studied in the context of interactions between passive components, it is increasingly recognized that active matter inclusions, such as molecular motors and catalytic enzymes in cells, play important roles in the formation, transport and interaction of membraneless droplets. Here we developed a bacteria-polymer active phase separation system to study the nonequilibrium effect of active matter inclusions on the LLPS dynamics. We found that the presence of bacterial active matter accelerated the initial condensation of phase-separated liquid droplets but subsequently arrested the droplet coarsening process, resulting in a stable suspension of membraneless active droplets packed with motile bacterial cells. The arrested phase separation of the bacterial active droplet system presumably arises from anti-phase entrainment of interface fluctuations between neighboring droplets, which reduces the frequency of inter-droplet contact and suppresses droplet coarsening. In addition, the active stresses generated by cells within the droplets give rise to an array of nonequilibrium phenomena, such as dominant long-wavelength fluctuations and enhanced droplet transport with short-term persistent motion due to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Our study reveals a unique mechanism for arrested phase separation and long-term stability in membraneless droplet systems. The bacteria-polymer active phase separation system opens a new avenue for studying the dynamics of membraneless active droplets relevant to non-equilibrium LLPS in cells and in biomedical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Feedback-controlled epithelial mechanics: emergent soft elasticity and active yielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological tissues exhibit distinct mechanical and rheological behaviors during morphogenesis. While much is known about tissue phase transitions controlled by structural order and cell mechanics, key questions regarding how tissue-scale nematic order emerges from cell-scale processes and influences tissue rheology remain unclear. Here, we develop a minimal vertex model that incorporates a coupling between active forces generated by cytoskeletal fibers and their alignment with local elastic stress in solid epithelial tissues. We show that this feedback loop induces an isotropic--nematic transition, leading to an ordered solid state that exhibits soft elasticity. Further increasing activity drives collective self-yielding, leading to tissue flows that are correlated across the entire system. This remarkable state, that we dub plastic nematic solid, is uniquely suited to facilitate active tissue remodeling during morphogenesis. It fundamentally differs from the well-studied fluid regime where macroscopic elastic stresses vanish and the velocity correlation length remains finite, controlled by activity. Altogether, our results reveal a rich spectrum of tissue states jointly governed by activity and passive cell deformability, with important implications for understanding tissue mechanics and morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic platform for biomimetic tissue design and multiscale rheological characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way living tissues respond to external mechanical forces is crucial in physiological processes like embryogenesis, homeostasis or tumor growth. Providing a complete description across length scales which relates the properties of individual cells to the rheological behavior of complex 3D-tissues remains an open challenge. The development of simplified biomimetic tissues capable of reproducing essential mechanical features of living tissues can help achieving this major goal. We report in this work the development of a microfluidic device that enables to achieve the sequential assembly of biomimetic prototissues and their rheological characterization. We synthesize prototissues by the controlled assembly of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) for which we can tailor their sizes and shapes as well as their level of GUV-GUV adhesion. We address a rheological description at multiple scales which comprises an analysis at the local scale of individual GUVs and at the global scale of the prototissue. The flow behavior of prototissues ranges from purely viscous to viscoelastic for increasing levels of adhesion. At low adhesion the flow response is dominated by viscous dissipation, which is mediated by GUV spatial reorganizations at the local scale, whereas at high adhesion the flow is viscoelastic, which results from a combination of internal reorganizations and deformation of individual GUVs. Such multiscale characterization of model biomimetic tissues provides a robust framework to rationalize the role of cell adhesion in the flow dynamics of living tissues.</description>

      <title>Feasibility and Single Parameter Scaling of Extinctions in Multispecies Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multispecies ecosystems modelled by generalized Lotka-Volterra equations exhibit stationary population abundances, where large number of species often coexist. Understanding the precise conditions under which this is at all feasible and what triggers species extinctions is a key, outstanding problem in theoretical ecology. Using standard methods of random matrix theory, I show that distributions of species abundances are Gaussian at equilibrium, in the weakly interacting regime. One consequence is that feasibility is generically broken before stability, for large enough number of species. I further derive an analytic expression for the probability that $n=0,1,2,...$ species go extinct and conjecture that a single-parameter scaling law governs species extinctions. These results are corroborated by numerical simulations in a wide range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>From Radiation Dose to Cellular Dynamics: A Discrete Model for Simulating Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is one of the most common cancer treatments, and dose optimization and targeting of radiation are crucial since both cancerous and healthy cells are affected. Different mathematical and computational approaches have been developed for this task. The most common mathematical approach, dating back to the late 1970's, is the linear-quadratic (LQ) model for the survival probability given the radiation dose. Most simulation models consider tissue as a continuum rather than consisting of discrete cells. While reasonable for large-scale models (e.g., human organs), continuum approaches necessarily neglect cellular-scale effects, which may play a role in growth, morphology, and metastasis of tumors. Here, we propose a method for modeling the effect of radiation on cells based on the mechanobiological \textsc{CellSim3D} simulation model for growth, division, and proliferation of cells. To model the effect of a radiation beam, we incorporate a Monte Carlo procedure into \textsc{CellSim3D} with the LQ model by introducing a survival probability at each beam delivery. Effective removal of dead cells by phagocytosis was also implemented. Systems with two types of cells were simulated: stiff slowly proliferating healthy cells and soft rapidly proliferating cancer cells. For model verification, the results were compared to prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) data for different doses and we found good agreement. In addition, we simulated proliferating systems and analyzed the probability density of the contact forces. We determined the state of the system with respect to the jamming transition and found very good agreement with experiments.</description>
