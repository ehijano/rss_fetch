      <title>Leveraging turbulence data with physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics informed neural network (PINN) can enhance the value of turbulence diagnostics data in fusion experiments. For example, it can predict a missing field in a physical system with information provided by measured data and the model equations of the system. We investigate effects of the noise in the data and the spatial resolution of diagnostics channels in the prediction of a missing field in a physical system using the PINN and existing data. We also discuss how spatio-temporal dynamics captured by turbulence diagnostics can directly test model equations of plasma turbulence.</description>

      <title>Effect of negative triangularity on SOL plasma turbulence in double-null L-mode plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of negative triangularity (NT) on boundary plasma turbulence in double-null (DN) configurations are investigated using global, nonlinear, three-dimensional, flux-driven two-fluid simulations. NT plasmas exhibit suppressed interchange-driven instabilities, resulting in enhanced confinement and lower fluctuation levels compared to positive triangularity (PT) plasmas. This reduction in interchange instability is associated with the weakening of curvature effects in the unfavorable region, caused by the stretching of magnetic field lines at the outer midplane. The magnetic disconnection between the turbulent low-field side (LFS) and the quiescent high-field side (HFS) results in most of the heat flux reaching the DN outer targets. In NT plasmas, the power load on the outer target is reduced, while it increases on the inner target, indicating a reduced in-out power asymmetry compared PT plasmas. Furthermore, the analysis of power load asymmetry between the upper and lower targets shows that the up-down power asymmetry is mitigated in NT plasmas, mainly due to the reduced total power crossing the separatrix. The reduction of interchange instabilities in NT plasmas also affects the blob dynamics. A three-dimensional blob analysis reveals that NT plasmas feature smaller blob sizes and slower propagation velocities. Finally, an analytical scaling law for blob size and velocity that includes plasma shaping effects is derived based on the two-region model and is found to qualitatively capture the trends observed in nonlinear simulations.</description>

      <title>A rational design method for the Nagoya type-III antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study, as part of a PhD project on the design of a helicon thruster, aims to provide a rational methodology for the design of the helicon thruster's main component, i.e., the helicon antenna. A helicon thruster is an innovative electrodeless plasma thruster that works by exciting helicon waves in a magnetized plasma, and its antenna is capable of producing a uniform, low-temperature, high-density plasma. A magnetic nozzle is used to accelerate the exhaust plasma in order to generate a propulsive thrust. In this paper, we consider a simple helicon antenna, specifically the Nagoya type-III antenna. We consider a common experimental setup consisting of a quartz tube with finite length containing a uniform magnetized plasma and a Nagoya type-III antenna placed at the tube centre. Considering previous studies on helicon waves theory, we compare three different design methods, each based on simplifying different modelling assumptions, and evaluate the predictions of these models with results from full-wave 3D simulations. In particular, we concentrate on deriving a rational design method for the helicon antenna length, given the dimension of the quartz tube and the desired target plasma parameters. This work aims to provide a practical and fast method for dimensioning the antenna length, useful for initializing more accurate but computationally heavier full-wave simulations in 3D geometry or simply for a rapid prototyping of the helicon antenna. These results can be useful for the development of a helicon thruster but also for the design of a high-density radiofrequency plasma source.</description>

      <title>The magnetic origin of the mystery of rare H$\alpha$ Moreton waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past three decades, a lot of coronal fast-mode waves were detected by space missions, but their counterparts in the chromosphere, called the Moreton waves, were rarely captured. How this happens remains a mystery. Here, to shed light on this problem, we investigate the photospheric vector magnetograms of the Moreton wave events associated with M- and X-class solar flares in 2010--2023. The H$\alpha$ data are taken with the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE). Our statistical results show that more than 80\% of the events occur at the edge of active regions and propagate non-radially due to asymmetric magnetic fields above the flares. According to the reconstructed magnetic field and atmospheric model, Moreton waves propagate in the direction along which the horizontal fast-mode wave speed drops the fastest. The result supports that the inclined magnetic configuration of the eruption is crucial to generate Moreton waves, even for X-class flares. It may explain the low occurrence rate of Moreton waves and why some X-class flares accompanied with coronal mass ejections (CMEs) do not generate Moreton waves.</description>

      <title>Mimetic finite difference schemes for transport operators with divergence-free advective field and applications to plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>Probing High-Speed Electron Behavior in Magnetized Plasma Using Intense Laser Pulses and Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we utilize intense laser pulses and advanced quantum mechanical frameworks to investigate the behavior of high-velocity electrons within magnetized plasma environments. The focus of our research is placed within the context of strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED), an area that explores the interaction of intense electromagnetic fields with charged particles. We propose new theoretical solutions that accurately describe these interactions by incorporating the effects of both the relativistic mass increase of fast-moving electrons and the influence of the electromagnetic field (or "light itself") within the plasma medium. Our approach diverges from traditional models by offering a more comprehensive treatment of the complex dynamics at play in these extreme conditions. Standard models of laser-plasma interactions often fail to capture the full spectrum of physical phenomena that arise when strong magnetic fields are present. In particular, the traditional assumptions about electron motion and radiation emission become less accurate, as the interplay between the laser, the plasma, and the magnetic field introduces additional layers of complexity. The novel solutions we present contribute to a deeper understanding of how radiation is emitted and interacts within magnetized plasmas, an essential aspect for advancing the development of next-generation laser-plasma accelerators. Our results underscore the limitations of conventional models and highlight the need for refined theoretical frameworks that can more accurately describe the intricate behaviors of particles and fields in these highly nonlinear environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova &amp; Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Reformulating polarized radiative transfer for astrophysical applications. (I) A formalism allowing non-local Magnus solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is diagnosed by solving the polarized radiative transfer problem for plasmas in Non-Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (NLTE). A key challenge in multidimensional NLTE diagnosis is to integrate the radiative transfer equation (RTE) efficiently, but current methods are local, limited to constant propagation matrices. The formalism presented in this paper lays the foundations to achieve an efficient non-local integration of the RTE based on the Magnus expansion. Our approach starts formulating the problem in terms of rotations represented in the Lorentz-Poincare group (Stokes formalism) and motivating the use of the Magnus expansion. Then, we combine a highly detailed algebraic characterization of the propagation matrix with Magnus to reformulate the homogenous solution to the RTE. Thus, we obtain a compact analytical evolution operator supporting arbitrary variations of the propagation matrix to first and second order in the Magnus expansion and showing the way to higher orders. Finally, we reformulate the inhomogeneous part to make it solvable with the Magnus expansion too, which gives rise to an interesting new object: the inhomogeneous evolution operator. This provides the first consistent and general formal solution of the RTE that furthermore is non-local, efficient, and accurate by design, with other peculiarity: it separates the integration part from the algebraic formal solution. Our framework is verified analytically and with a computational implementation that leads to a new family of numerical radiative transfer methods and suggests several applications, e.g. accelerating NLTE calculations with non-local radiative transfer. With cosmetic changes, our results apply to other universal physical problems sharing the Lorentz-Poincare algebra of the RTE and special relativity.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using \texttt{dbscan}, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as \emph{in-situ} satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of auroras. What is more, the radar aurora bulk motions exhibit key qualities of auroral electric field enhancements that has previously been observed with various instruments. We present preliminary statistical results using our new method, and briefly discuss the method's limitations and potential future adaptations.</description>
