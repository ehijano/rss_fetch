      <title>Dynamical Quantum Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in background-independent quantum gravity, we discuss the quantization of labeled and unlabeled finite multigraphs with a maximum edge count. We provide a unified way to represent quantum multigraphs with labeled or unlabeled vertices, which enables the study of quantum multigraphs as dynamical microscopic degrees of freedom and not just as representations of relations among quantum states of particles. The quantum multigraphs represent a quantum mechanical treatment of the relations themselves and give rise to Hilbert space realizations of relations. After defining the Hilbert space, we focus on quantum simple graphs and explore the thermodynamics resulting from two simple models, a free Hamiltonian and an Ising-type Hamiltonian (with interactions among nearest-neighbor edges). We show that removing the distinction among vertices by considering unlabeled vertices gives rise to a qualitatively different thermodynamics. We find that the free theory of labeled quantum simple graphs is the Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi--Gilbert $G(N,p)$ model of random graphs. This model has analytic free energy and hence no thermodynamic phase transition. On the other hand, the unlabeled quantum graphs give rise to proper thermodynamic phase transitions in both the free and the ferromagnetic Ising models, characterized by divergence in the specific heat and critical slowing near the critical temperature. The thermodynamic phase transition has an order parameter given as the fraction of vertices in the largest connected component. Although this is similar to the phase transition in the $G(N,p)$ model, in this case it represents the actual thermodynamic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Spectral Broadening of Landau Levels by a Penetrable Circular Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two--dimensional magnetic Schr\"odinger operator with a penetrable circular wall modeled by a $\delta$--interaction. Using the boundary triple approach we classify all self--adjoint extensions and obtain Krein's resolvent formula, showing that the essential spectrum coincides with the Landau levels. The wall breaks their infinite degeneracy and produces a spectral broadening: each Landau level becomes an accumulation point of discrete eigenvalues from one side. In the circular case, rotational symmetry reduces the eigenvalue problem to scalar equations with explicit Weyl coefficients. We prove strict monotonicity, ensuring that each angular momentum channel contributes at most one eigenvalue per gap, and derive asymptotics showing that the boundary coefficients decay faster than any exponential, explaining the strong localization of the broadened spectrum. Numerical simulations are consistent with these results.</description>

      <title>Upper block triangular form for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the special orthogonal group acquired through a flag of trace polynomials spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laplacian of a general trace polynomial function defined on the special orthogonal group $SO(N)$ is explicitly computed. An invariant flag of spaces generated by trace polynomials is constructed. The matrix of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $SO(N)$ for this flag of vector spaces takes an upper block triangular form. As a consequence of this construction, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $SO(N)$ can be computed in an iterative manner. For the particular cases of the special orthogonal groups $SO(3)$ and $SO(4)$ the complete list of eigenvalues is obtained and the corresponding irreducible characters of the representation for these groups are expressed as trace polynomials.</description>

      <title>In search of constitutive conditions in isotropic hyperelasticity: polyconvexity versus true-stress-true-strain monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polyconvexity of a strain-energy function is nowadays increasingly presented as the ultimate material stability condition for an idealized elastic response. While the mathematical merits of polyconvexity are clearly understood, its mechanical consequences have received less attention. In this contribution we contrast polyconvexity with the recently rediscovered true-stress-true-strain monotonicity (TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$) condition. By way of explicit examples, we show that neither condition by itself is strong enough to guarantee physically reasonable behavior for ideal isotropic elasticity. In particular, polyconvexity does not imply a monotone trajectory of the Cauchy stress in unconstrained uniaxial extension which TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ ensures. On the other hand, TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ does not impose a monotone Cauchy shear stress response in simple shear which is enforced by Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity and in turn polyconvexity. Both scenarios are proven through the construction of appropriate strain-energy functions. Consequently, a combination of polyconvexity, ensuring Legendre-Hadamard ellipticity, and TSTS-M${}^{++}\!$ seems to be a viable solution to Truesdell's Hauptproblem. However, so far no isotropic strain-energy function has been identified that satisfies both constraints globally at the same time. Although we are unable to deliver a valid solution here, we provide several results that could prove helpful in the construction of such an exceptional strain-energy function.</description>

      <title>Large scale dynamical response of interacting $1d$ Fermi systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of a class of weakly interacting, gapless $1d$ fermionic systems, in presence of small external perturbations slowly varying in space and in time. We consider the evolution of the expectation values of the charge density and of the current density, in the thermodynamic limit and for low enough temperatures. We prove the validity and the asymptotic exactness of linear response in the limit of vanishing space-time variation of the perturbation, and we provide the explicit expression of the response of the system. The proof relies on the representation of the real time Duhamel expansion in terms of Euclidean correlation functions, for which we provide sharp estimates using rigorous renormalization group methods. The asymptotic exactness of linear response holds thanks to a cancellation for the scaling limit of the correlations that is reminiscent of bosonization, and which is derived rigorously using emergent chiral Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Design-GenNO: A Physics-Informed Generative Model with Neural Operators for Inverse Microstructure Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse microstructure design plays a central role in materials discovery, yet remains challenging due to the complexity of structure-property linkages and the scarcity of labeled training data. We propose Design-GenNO, a physics-informed generative neural operator framework that unifies generative modeling with operator learning to address these challenges. In Design-GenNO, microstructures are encoded into a low-dimensional, well-structured latent space, which serves as the generator for both reconstructing microstructures and predicting solution fields of governing PDEs. MultiONet-based decoders enable functional mappings from latent variables to both microstructures and full PDE solution fields, allowing a multitude of design objectives to be addressed without retraining. A normalizing flow prior regularizes the latent space, facilitating efficient sampling and robust gradient-based optimization. A distinctive feature of the framework is its physics-informed training strategy: by embedding PDE residuals directly into the learning objective, Design-GenNO significantly reduces reliance on labeled datasets and can even operate in a self-supervised setting. We validate the method on a suite of inverse design tasks in two-phase materials, including effective property matching, recovery of microstructures from sparse field measurements, and maximization of conductivity ratios. Across all tasks, Design-GenNO achieves high accuracy, generates diverse and physically meaningful designs, and consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Moreover, it demonstrates strong extrapolation by producing microstructures with effective properties beyond the training distribution. These results establish Design-GenNO as a robust and general framework for physics-informed inverse design, offering a promising pathway toward accelerated materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Free Cumulants and Full Eigenstate Thermalization from Boundary Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs) and their higher-order generalizations present important probes of quantum information dynamics and scrambling. We introduce a solvable many-body quantum model, which we term boundary scrambling, for which the full dynamics of higher-order OTOCs is analytically tractable. These dynamics support a decomposition into free cumulants and unify recent extensions of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis with predictions from random quantum circuit models. We obtain exact expressions for (higher-order) correlations between matrix elements and show these to be stable away from the solvable point. The solvability is enabled by the identification of a higher-order Markovian influence matrix, capturing the effect of the full system on a local subsystem. These results provide insight into the emergence of random-matrix behavior from structured Floquet dynamics and show how techniques from free probability can be applied in the construction of exactly-solvable many-body models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information matrix via its classical counterpart from random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preconditioning with the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) is a popular approach in quantum variational algorithms. Yet the QFIM is costly to obtain directly, usually requiring more state preparation than its classical counterpart: the classical Fisher information matrix (CFIM). We rigorously prove that averaging the classical Fisher information matrix over Haar-random measurement bases yields $\mathbb{E}_{U\sim\mu_H}[F^U(\boldsymbol{\theta})] = \frac{1}{2}Q(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ for pure states in $\mathbb{C}^N$. Furthermore, we obtain the variance of CFIM ($O(N^{-1})$) and establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds ($\exp(-\Theta(N)t^2)$), demonstrating that using few random measurement bases is sufficient to approximate the QFIM accurately, especially in high-dimensional settings. This work establishes a solid theoretical foundation for efficient quantum natural gradient methods via randomized measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we have analyzed semi-discrete finite element approximation and full discretization of the Stochastic semilinear generalized Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation in a bounded convex polygonal domain driven by additive Wiener noise. We use the finite element method for spatial discretization and the semi-implicit method for time discretization and derive a strong convergence rate with respect to both parameters (spatial and temporal). Numerical experiments have also been performed to support theoretical bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an n-qubit quantum system with a Hamiltonian, defined by an expansion in the Pauli basis, and propose a new algorithm for classical computing the exponential of the Hamiltonian. The algorithm is based on the representation of the exponential by the Dunford-Cauchy integral, followed by an efficient computation of the resolvent, and is suitable for Hamiltonians that are sparse in the Pauli basis. The practical efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by two illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>A Unified Symmetry-Constrained Framework for Band Inversions in Photonic Crystals with $C_n$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of a unified theoretical framework for characterizing band inversions across different crystal symmetries hinders the rapid development of topological photonic band engineering. To address this issue, we have constructed a framework constrained by symmetry $k \cdot p$ that universally models bands near high-symmetry points for symmetric photonic crystals $C_6$, $C_4$, $C_3$, and $C_2$. This framework enables a coefficient-free quantitative diagnosis of band topology. We have demonstrated the power of this framework by systematically engineering band inversions. In $C_6$ crystals, we induce a reopening of the linear gap at $\Gamma$. In $C_4$ systems, mirror symmetry enforces a characteristic quadratic coupling leading to distinct spectral features. Our analysis further reveals that a lone $E$ doublet prevents inversion at the $\Gamma$ point in $C_3$ symmetry, while $C_2$ symmetry facilitates a unique inversion of $Y$ pointsints with anisotropic gap. This symmetry-first, fit-free approach establishes a direct link between experimental band maps and the extraction of fundamental topological parameters. It offers a universal tool for inversion and coupling-order identification.</description>

      <title>Boundary Actions and Loop Groups: A Geometric Picture of Gauge Symmetries at Null Infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work arXiv:2407.13556, we proposed an extended phase space structure at null infinity accommodating large gauge symmetries for sub$^n$-leading soft theorems in Yang-Mills, via dressing fields arising in the Stueckelberg procedure. Here, we give an explicit boundary action controlling the dynamics of these fields. This allows for a derivation from first principles of the associated charges, together with an explicit renormalization procedure when taking the limit to null and spatial infinity, matching with charges proposed in previous work. Using the language of fibre bundles, we relate the existence of Stueckelberg fields to the notion of extension/reduction of the structure group of a principal bundle, thereby deriving their transformation rules in a natural way, thus realising them as Goldstone-like objects. Finally, this allows us to give a geometric picture of the gauge transformation structure at the boundary, via a loop group coming from formal expansions in the coordinate transversal to the boundary.</description>

      <title>The Random Walk Pinning Model II: Upper bounds on the free energy and disorder relevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the question of disorder relevance for the continuous-time Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) and completes the results of our companion paper. The RWPM considers a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$, whose law is modified by a Gibbs weight given by $\exp(\beta \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{X_t=Y_t\}} dt)$, where $Y=(Y_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is a quenched trajectory of a second (independent) random walk and $\beta \geq 0$ is the inverse temperature. The random walk $Y$ has the same distribution as $X$ but a jump rate $\rho \geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For fixed $\rho\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition as $\beta$ crosses a critical threshold $\beta_c(\rho)$. The question of disorder relevance then consists in determining whether a disorder of arbitrarily small intensity $\rho$ changes the properties of the phase transition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\gamma$-stable walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-stable law, with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we show that disorder is relevant when $\gamma \in (0,\frac23]$, namely that $\beta_c(\rho)&gt;\beta_c(0)$ for every $\rho&gt;0$. We also provide lower bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the upper bounds obtained in our companion paper. Interestingly, in the marginal case $\gamma = \frac23$, disorder is always relevant, independently of the fine properties of the random walk distribution. When $\gamma \in (\frac23,1)$, our companion paper proves that disorder is irrelevant (in particular $\beta_c(\rho)=\beta_c(0)$ for $\rho$ small enough). We provide here an upper bound on the free energy in the regime $\gamma\in (\frac 2 3,1)$ that highlights the fact that although disorder is irrelevant, it still has a non-trivial effect on the phase transition, at any $\rho&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The Random Walk Pinning Model I: Lower bounds on the free energy and disorder irrelevance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Random Walk Pinning Model (RWPM) is a statistical mechanics model in which the trajectory of a continuous time random walk $X=(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ is rewarded according to the time it spends together with a moving catalyst. More specifically for a system of size $T$, the law of $X$ is tilted by the Gibbs factor $\exp(\beta \int_0^T \mathbf{1}_{\{X_t=Y_t\}} dt)$, where $\beta \geq 0$ is the inverse temperature. The moving catalyst $Y=(Y_t)_{t\ge 0}$ is given by the quenched trajectory of a second continuous-time random walk, with the same distribution as $X$ but a different jump rate $\rho\geq 0$, interpreted as the disorder intensity. For fixed $\rho\ge 0$, the RWPM undergoes a localization phase transition when $\beta$ passes a critical value $\beta_c(\rho)$. We thoroughly investigate the question of disorder relevance to determine whether a disorder of arbitrarily small intensity affects the features of the phase transition. We focus our analysis on the case of transient $\gamma$-stable walks on $\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. random walks in the domain of attraction of a $\gamma$-stable law, with $\gamma\in (0,1)$. In the present paper, we derive lower bounds for the free energy, which results in either a proof of disorder irrelevance or upper bounds on the critical point shift. More precisely, when $\gamma \in(\frac23,1)$, our estimates imply that that $\beta_c(\rho)=\beta_c(0)$ and $\rho$ is small, showing disorder irrelevance. When $\gamma\in (0,\frac23]$ our companion paper shows that $\beta_c(\rho)&gt;\beta_c(0)$ for every $\rho&gt;0$, showing disorder relevance: we derive here upper bounds on the critical point shift, which are matching the lower bounds obtained in our companion paper. For good measure, our analysis also includes the case of the simple random walk of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for $d\ge 3$) for which no upper bound on the critical point shift was previously known.</description>

      <title>Sandwich Construction of Symmetry TFTs for the Centre Symmetries of Chern-Simons, Yang-Mills, and Einstein Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) using the sandwich construction of Pulmann-\v{S}evera-Valach that manifest the centre symmetries of Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory as well as general relativity in the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation. The 'filling' of the sandwich is an AKSZ sigma model whose target space is a Weil algebra, augmented with discrete degrees of freedom given by a choice of topological boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition in Long-Range $q-$state Models via Contours. Clock and Potts Models with Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the group structure of the state space of $q-$state models, a new definition of contour for long-range spin-systems in $\Z^d$ ($d\geq 2$), and a multidimensional version of Fr\"{o}hlich-Spencer contours, we prove phase transition for a class of ferromagnetic long-range systems which includes the Clock and Potts models. Our arguments work for the entire region of exponents of regular power-law interactions, namely $\alpha &gt; d$, and for any $q \geq 2$. As an application, we prove phase transition for Potts models with decaying fields when the field decays fast enough and in the presence of a random external field.</description>

      <title>On Stochastic Variational Principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of stochastic variational principles involves the problem of constructing fixed-endpoint and adapted variations of semimartingales. We provide a detailed construction of variations of semimartingales that are not only fixed at deterministic endpoints, but also fixed at first entry times and first exit times for charts in a manifold. We prove a stochastic version of the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations in the context of these variations. Using this framework, we provide a generalization of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle in local coordinates to arbitrary noise semimartingales. For the corresponding global form of the stochastic Hamilton-Pontryagin principle, we introduce a novel approach to global variational principles by restricting to semimartingales obtained as solutions of Stratonovich equations.</description>

      <title>From Magic State Distillation to Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic State Distillation (MSD) has been a research focus for fault-tolerant quantum computing due to the need for non-Clifford resource in gaining quantum advantage. Although many of the MSD protocols so far are based on stabilizer codes with transversal $T$ gates, there exists quite several protocols that don't fall into this class. Here we propose a method to map MSD protocols to iterative dynamical systems under the framework of stabilizer reduction. With the proposed mapping, we are able to analyze the performance of MSD protocols using techniques from dynamical systems theory, easily simulate the distillation process of input states under arbitrary noise and visualize it using flow diagram. We apply our mapping to common MSD protocols for $\ket{T}$ state and find some interesting properties: The $[[15, 1, 3]]$ code may distill states corresponding to $\sqrt{T}$ gate and the $[[5, 1, 3]]$ code can distill the magic state corresponding to the $T$ gate. Besides, we examine the exotic MSD protocols that may distill into other magic states proposed in [Eur. Phys. J. D 70, 55 (2016)] and identify the condition for distillable magic states. We also study new MSD protocols generated by concatenating different codes and numerically demonstrate that concatenation can generate MSD protocols with various magic states. By concatenating efficient codes with exotic codes, we can reduce the overhead of the exotic MSD protocols. We believe our proposed method will be a useful tool for simulating and visualization MSD protocols for canonical MSD protocols on $\ket{T}$ as well as other unexplored MSD protocols for other states.</description>

      <title>C-R-T Fractionalization in the First Quantized Hamiltonian Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the CRT symmetry for fermions exhibits a fractionalization distinct from the $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{C}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{R}}\times\mathbb{Z}_2^{\mathcal{T}}$ for scalar bosons. In fact, the CRT symmetry for fermions can be extended by internal symmetries such as fermion parity, thereby forming a group extension of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ direct product. Conventionally, a Majorana fermion is defined by one Dirac fermion with trivial charge conjugation. However, when the spacetime dimension $d+1=5,6,7\bmod8$, the real dimension of Majorana fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\chi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d,0)}$) aligns with the real dimension of Dirac fermion (dim$_{\mathbb{R}}\psi_{\mathcal{C}\ell(d)}$), rather than being half, which necessitates the introduction of a symplectic Majorana fermion, defined by two Dirac fermions with trivial charge conjugation. To include these two types of Majorana fermions, we embed the theory in $n_{\mathbb{R}}$ and define the Majorana fermion field as a representation of the real Clifford algebra with 8-fold periodicity. Within the Hamiltonian formalism, we identify the 8-fold CRT-internal symmetry groups across general dimensions. Similarly, Dirac fermion field is defined as a representation of the complex Clifford algebra with 2-fold periodicity. Interestingly, we discover that the CRT-internal symmetry groups exhibit an 8-fold periodicity that is distinct from that of the complex Clifford algebra. In certain dimensions where distinct mass terms can span a mass manifold, the CRT-internal symmetries can act non-trivially upon this mass manifold. Employing domain wall reduction method, we are able to elucidate the relationships between symmetries across different dimensions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic L\'evy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sums of independent and identically distributed random velocities in special relativity. We show that the resulting one-dimensional velocity distributions are not only stable under relativistic velocity addition but define a genuinely new class of stochastic processes--relativistic L\'evy processes. Given a system, this allows identifying distinct relativistic regimes in terms of the distribution's concavity at the origin and the probability of measuring relativistic velocities. These features provide a protocol to assess the relevance of stochastic relativistic effects in actual experiments. As supporting evidence, we find agreement with previous results about heavy-ion diffusion and show that our findings are consistent with the distribution of momentum deviations observed in measurements of antiproton cooling.</description>

      <title>Positive geometries and canonical forms via mixed Hodge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ''Positive geometries'' are a class of semi-algebraic domains which admit a unique ''canonical form'': a logarithmic form whose residues match the boundary structure of the domain. The study of such geometries is motivated by recent progress in particle physics, where the corresponding canonical forms are interpreted as the integrands of scattering amplitudes. We recast these concepts in the language of mixed Hodge theory, and identify ''genus zero pairs'' of complex algebraic varieties as a natural and general framework for the study of positive geometries and their canonical forms. In this framework, we prove some basic properties of canonical forms which have previously been proved or conjectured in the literature. We give many examples and study in detail the case of arrangements of hyperplanes and convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Zeros of 2D Nearest-Neighbor Antiferromagnetic Ising Models: A Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit of the 2D nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic Ising model on square and triangular lattices. We employ the Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion (NLCE) equipped with Exact Enumeration (EE) of the partition function to estimate the Laplacian of the free energy, which is proportional to the zeros density. Using a modified NLCE, where the expansion can be carried directly on the Yang-Lee zeros of the involved clusters, we estimate the density of Yang-Lee zeros in the thermodynamic limit. NLCE gives significantly more zeros than EE in the complex field plane providing more insights on how the root curves look in the thermodynamic limit. For the square lattice at $T \ll T_c$, the results suggest that two vertical lines at $\pm h_c(T)$ in the complex field plane (i.e two concentric circles in the complex fugacity plane) are the thermodynamic root curves. A similar picture is expected for the triangular lattice for phase transitions at large values of magnetic field while further study is needed for phase transitions at smaller values of magnetic field. The convergence of the NLCE and (EE) calculations of the partition function to the thermodynamic limit is studied in both lattices and the temperature-field phase diagram is obtained from Yang-Lee zeros using both methods. This NLCE-based approach will facilitate the study of different types of phase transitions using Yang-Lee zeros in future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra subject to certain conditions. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist. The structure of braces emerges naturally in this context by requiring the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra to be a Hopf algebra and a quasi-triangular bialgebra after twisting. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar set-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then apply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra and we also obtain its twisted version.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Regularity Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of regularity structures [Hai14] to allow processes belonging to locally $m$-convex topological algebras. This extension includes processes in the locally $C^{*}$-algebras of [CHP25] used to localise singular stochastic partial differential equations involving fermions, as well as processes in Banach algebras such as infinite-dimensional semicircular\circular Brownian motion, and more generally the $q$-Gaussians of [BS91, BKS97, Bo\.z99].
  A new challenge we encounter in the $q$-Gaussian setting with $q \in (-1,1)$ are noncommutative renormalisation estimates where we must estimate operators in homogeneous $q$-Gaussian chaoses with arbitrary operator insertions. We introduce a new Banach algebra norm on $q$-Gaussian operators that allows us to control such insertions; we believe this construction could be of independent interest.</description>
