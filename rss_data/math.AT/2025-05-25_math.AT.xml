      <title>Identifying cobordisms using kernel persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in chemistry, we give a homlogical definition of tunnels, or more generally cobordisms, connecting disjoint parts of a cell complex. For a filtered complex, this defines a persistence module. We give a method for identifying birth and death times using kernel persistence and a matrix reduction algorithm for pairing birth and death times.</description>

      <title>On ratios of Chern numbers for complex hyperbolic branched covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that, at least in even complex dimensions, the ratio of Chern numbers for a closed complex hyperbolic branched cover manifold are not all equal to the corresponding ratio of Chern numbers for a closed complex hyperbolic manifold. This leads to an answer for a question posed by Deraux and Seshadri, and proves that an almost $1/4$-pinched metric constructed by the author in a previous article is not K\"{a}hler.</description>

      <title>Locating topological structures in digital images via local homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rising branch in modern applied mathematics. It extracts topological structures as features of a given space and uses these features to analyze digital data. Persistent homology, one of the central tools in TDA, defines persistence barcodes to measure the changes in local topologies among deformations of topological spaces. Although local spatial changes characterize barcodes, it is hard to detect the locations of corresponding structures of barcodes due to computational limitations. The paper provides an efficient and concise way to divide the underlying space and applies the local homology of the divided system to approximate the locations of local holes in the based space. We also demonstrate this local homology framework on digital images.</description>

      <title>Topological rigidity of quoric manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quoric manifolds are the quaternionic analogue of toric manifolds. They admit a locally nice action of $(S^3)^n$ and the quotient is a manifold with corners. We show that they satisfy equivariant rigidity. More precisely, any locally linear $(S^3)^n$-manifold that it is equivariantly homotopic equivalent to a quoric manifold is equivariantly homeomorphic to it. The proof is given by generalising the methods of used in Coxeter and toric manifolds.</description>

      <title>Parametrized (higher) semiadditivity and the universality of spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07676v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiadditivity of an $\infty$-category, i.e. the existence of biproducts, provides it with useful algebraic structure in the form of a canonical enrichment in commutative monoids. This ultimately comes from the fact that the $\infty$-category of commutative monoids is the universal semiadditive $\infty$-category equipped with a finite-product-preserving functor to spaces, or equivalently that the $(2,1)$-category of spans of finite sets is the universal semiadditive $\infty$-category. In this article, we prove a vast generalization of these facts in the context of parametrized semiadditivity, a notion we define using Hopkins-Lurie's framework of ambidexterity. This simultaneously generalizes a result of Harpaz for higher semiadditivity and a result of Nardin for equivariant semiadditivity. We deduce that every parametrized semiadditive $\infty$-category is canonically enriched in Mackey functors/sheaves with transfers.
  As an application, we reprove the Mackey functor description of global spectra first obtained by the second-named author and generalize it to $G$-global spectra. Moreover, we obtain universal characterizations of the $\infty$-categories of $\mathbb Z$-valued $G$-Mackey profunctors and of quasi-finitely genuine $G$-spectra as studied by Kaledin and Krause-McCandless-Nikolaus, respectively.</description>

      <title>The fundamental group and the magnitude-path spectral sequence of a directed graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental group of a directed graph admits a natural sequence of quotient groups called $r$-fundamental groups, and the $r$-fundamental groups can capture properties of a directed graph that the fundamental group cannot capture. The fundamental group of a directed graph is related to path homology through the Hurewicz theorem. The magnitude-path spectral sequence connects magnitude homology and path homology of a directed graph, and it may be thought of as a sequence of homology of a directed graph, including path homology. In this paper, we study relations of the $r$-fundamental groups and the magnitude-path spectral sequence through the Hurewicz theorem and the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.</description>

      <title>Unipotent homotopy theory of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on To\"en's work on affine stacks, we develop a certain homotopy theory for schemes, which we call "unipotent homotopy theory." Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, we prove that the unipotent homotopy group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ introduced in our paper recover the unipotent Nori fundamental group scheme, the $p$-adic \'etale homotopy groups, as well as certain formal groups introduced by Artin and Mazur. We prove a version of the classical Freudenthal suspension theorem as well as a profiniteness theorem for unipotent homotopy group schemes. We also introduce the notion of a formal sphere and use it to show that for Calabi-Yau varieties of dimension $n$, the group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ are derived invariants for all $i \ge 0$; the case $i=n$ is related to recent work of Antieau and Bragg involving topological Hochschild homology. Using the unipotent homotopy group schemes, we establish a correspondence between formal Lie groups and certain higher algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>K-theoretic Tate-Poitou duality at prime 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the result of Blumberg and Mandell on K-theoretic Tate-Poitou duality at odd primes which serves as a spectral refinement of the classical arithmetic Tate-Poitou duality. The duality is formulated for the $K(1)$-localized algebraic K-theory of the ring of $p$-integers in a number field and its completion using the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Anderson duality. This paper completes the picture by addressing the prime 2, where the real embeddings of number fields introduce extra complexities. As an application, we identify the homotopy type at prime 2 of the homotopy fiber of the cyclotomic trace for the sphere spectrum in terms of the algebraic K-theory of the integers.</description>

      <title>Realizability of fusion systems by discrete groups: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare four different types of realizability for saturated fusion systems over discrete $p$-toral groups. For example, when $G$ is a locally finite group all of whose $p$-subgroups are artinian (hence discrete $p$-toral), we show that it has ``weakly Sylow'' $p$-subgroups and give explicit constructions of saturated fusion systems and associated linking systems associated to $G$. We also show that a fusion system over a discrete $p$-toral group $S$ is saturated if its set of morphisms is closed under a certain topology and the finite subgroups of $S$ satisfy the saturation axioms, and prove a version of the Cartan-Eilenberg stable elements theorem for locally finite groups.</description>
