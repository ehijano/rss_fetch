      <title>Understanding Ion Distribution and Diffusion in Solid Polymer Electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid polymer electrolytes exhibit ion conduction and high mechanical properties, thus are promising materials for future energy storage devices. The ion conductivity in an SPE is intricately connected to salt ion distribution in the polymer matrix. The relationship between ion diffusion and ion distribution remains unresolved. Here, we conduct coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations and establish correlations between ion distribution and transport for a phenomenological SPE model. We propose phase diagrams of SPEs as a function of ion pair size, ion concentration and the Bjerrum length of the material. A crossover from a discrete ion aggregate to a percolated ion aggregate is demonstrated as a function of ion pair size in the SPE. Further, we determine ion diffusions for all the phases of the SPE. The work provides important design strategies for controlling ion distribution and enhancing ion conductivity in a polymer matrix.</description>

      <title>Error evaluation of partial scattering functions obtained from contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to experimental SANS data of polyrotaxane solutions with different contrasts, and have successfully estimated the errors of $S$. The quantitative error estimation of $S$ offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.</description>

      <title>Polycatenated Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architected materials derive their properties from the geometric arrangement of their internal structural elements, rather than solely from their chemical composition. They can display remarkable behaviors such as high strength while being lightweight, negative Poisson's ratios, and shear-normal coupling. However, architected materials so far have either exhibited solid-like or fluid-like behavior, but not both. Here, we introduce a class of materials that consist of linked particles assembled in three-dimensional domains, forming polycatenated architected materials (PAMs). We propose a general framework for PAMs that translates arbitrary crystalline networks into particles' concatenations and design particles' geometry. The resulting materials are cohesive, yet the individual particles retain some kinematic freedom. In response to small external loads, PAMs behave like non-Newtonian fluids, showing both shear-thinning and shear-thickening responses. At larger strains, PAMs behave like solids, showing a nonlinear stress-strain relation, like lattices and foams. These responses are regulated by a jamming transition determined by the particles' arrangement and the direction of loading. PAMs are scalable, showing comparable mechanical responses at both millimeter- and micrometer-scales. However, micro-PAMs can change shape in response to electrostatic charges. PAM's properties are relevant for developing stimuli-responsive materials, energy-absorbing systems and morphing architectures.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamically Consistent Model for Yield Stress Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we formulate a thermodynamically consistent rheological model for yield stress fluids by introducing an internal dynamic variable and extending the framework established by Kamani et al (2021) and the classical Oldroyd-B model. The dynamics of the internal variable capture the material's transient response to changes in deformation, characterized by an effective relaxation time, elastic modulus, and viscosity. To assess the model's validity and range of applicability, we compare it with the recently developed Kamani-Donley-Rogers (KDR) model in terms of various material and rheometric functions, highlighting both divergences and parallels between the two models. Our numerical results on a host of material functions and rheological parameters illustrate the practical applicability and advantages of the new thermodynamically consistent model over the KDR model. Specifically, the new model complies with the second law of thermodynamics and can describe a broader range of rheological properties of yield stress fluids.</description>

      <title>Controlling Colloidal Flow through a Microfluidic Y-junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic particles flowing through narrow channels may accumulate near bifurcation points provoking flow reduction, clogging and ultimately chip breakage. Here we show that the full flow behavior of colloidal particles through a microfluidic Y-junction (i.e. a three way intersection) can be controlled by tuning the pair interactions and the degree of confinement. By combining experiments with numerical simulations, we investigate the dynamic states emerging when magnetizable colloids flow through a symmetric Y-junction such that a single particle can pass through both gates with the same probability. We show that clogging can be avoided by repulsive interactions and branching into the two channels can be steered as well by interactions: attractive particles are flowing through the same gate, while repulsive colloids alternate between the two gates. Even details of the particle assembly such as buckling at the exit gate are tunable by interactions and the channel geometry.</description>

      <title>Half-integer Vortices Paired via String Micelles in Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals Facilitated by Ionic Polymer Doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals are an intriguing polar system for exploring topological defects, and their properties are subject to significant influence by ionic doping. A prior theory based on a modified XY model predicts that string defects with half-integer vortex-antivortex pairs can be excited, while such stable string defects have not been directly observed in polar materials. Here, we report that doping the ferroelectric nematic material RM734 with cationic polymers can facilitate the formation of abundant string defects with butterfly textures. The string defects exhibit a polarization field restricted to 2D plane that is divided by N\'eel type domain walls into domains with either uniform polarization or negative splay deformation in the butterfly wing areas (positive bound charges). We establish a charge double layer model for the string defects: the strings of cationic polymer chains and close packing RM734 molecules form the Stern charge layer, and the small anionic ions and the positive bound charges (due to splay deformation) form the charge diffusion layer. We demonstrate that only cationic polymeric doping is effective due to the coupling between the flexoelectricity and the pear shape of the RM734 molecules. We estimate the line charge density of the strings via measuring the divergence of the polarization and the electrophoretic motion mobility, and obtain good qualitative agreement. We further show that the field-driven polarization reversal undergoes either string rotation or generating and merging with kink walls.</description>

      <title>Dynamical clustering and wetting phenomena in inertial active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical clustering represents a characteristic feature of active matter consisting of self-propelled agents that convert energy from the environment into mechanical motion. At the micron scale, typical of overdamped dynamics, particles with opposite motility block each other and show transient dynamical arrest that can induce cluster nucleation and motility-induced phase separation. However, for macroscopic agents, inertia plays a leading role, and clustering is strongly affected by bounce-back effects during collisions that could inhibit cluster growth. Here we present an experiment on the clustering of active granular particles, in which inertia can be systematically tuned. A plethora of new phenomena impacted severely by inertia is presented. Clusters display an inertia-induced transition from liquid-like to crystal-like inner structures that is accompanied by the suppression of cluster nucleation at system boundaries due to particle inertia. In contrast to microswimmers, where active particles wet the boundary by primarily forming clusters attached to the container walls, in an underdamped inertial active system, walls do not favor cluster formation and effectively annihilate motility-induced wetting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic conformal order revealed in geometrically confined long-range repulsive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating long-range interaction guided organization of matter is a fundamental question in physical systems covering multiple length scales. Here, based on the hexagonal disk model, we analyze the characteristic inhomogeneity created by long-range repulsions, and reveal the intrinsic conformal order in particle packings in mechanical equilibrium. Specifically, we highlight the delicate angle-preserved bending of the lattice to match the inhomogeneity condition. The revealed conformal order is found to be protected by the surrounding topological defects. These results advance our understanding on long-range interacting systems, and open the promising possibilities of using long-range forces to create particle packings not accessible by short-range forces, which may have practical consequences.</description>

      <title>Inferring interaction potentials from stochastic particle trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate interaction potentials between microscopic components such as colloidal particles or cells are crucial to understanding a range of processes, including colloidal crystallization, bacterial colony formation, and cancer metastasis. Even in systems where the precise interaction mechanisms are unknown, effective interactions can be measured to inform simulation and design. However, these measurements are difficult and time-intensive, and often require conditions that are drastically different from in situ conditions of the system of interest. Moreover, existing methods of measuring interparticle potentials rely on constraining a small number of particles at equilibrium, placing limits on which interactions can be measured. We introduce a method for inferring interaction potentials directly from trajectory data of interacting particles. We explicitly solve the equations of motion to find a form of the potential that maximizes the probability of observing a known trajectory. Our method is valid for systems both in and out of equilibrium, is well-suited to large numbers of particles interacting in typical system conditions, and does not assume a functional form of the interaction potential. We apply our method to infer the interactions of colloidal spheres from experimental data, successfully extracting the range and strength of a depletion interaction from the motion of the particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach toward characterizing local structural features of two-dimensional particle systems. The approach can accurately identify and characterize defects in high-temperature crystals, distinguish a wide range of nominally disordered systems, and robustly describe complex structures such as grain boundaries. This paper also introduces two-dimensional functionality into the open-source software program VoroTop which automates this analysis. This software package is built on a recently-introduced multithreaded version of VORO++, enabling the analysis of systems with billions of particles on high-performance computer architectures.</description>

      <title>Emergent Ferroelectric Nematic and Heliconical Ferroelectric Nematic States in an Achiral "Straight" Polar Rod Mesogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (NFLCs) are distinguished by their remarkable polarization characteristics and diverse physical phenomena, sparking significant interest and excitement within the scientific community. To date, over 150 NFLC molecules have been developed; however, there are no reports regarding straight linear polar molecules with a parallel alignment of the permanent dipole moment and the molecular axis. The straight polar mesogen nBOE exhibited an enantiotropic NF phase with a wide temperature window (up to 100 K) despite having a longer alkyl chain (up to n = 6) than the critical alkyl chain length of conventional models. Interestingly, nBOE with a medium length alkyl chain displayed an exotic phase sequence of NF-HCNF-SmCF during the elimination of positional displacement among adjacent molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate the reflective color modulation of the HCNFLC over the entire VIS-NIR spectral regime by ultralow E-field (up to 0.14 V um^-1).</description>

      <title>Back-Propagating Rupture: Nature, Excitation, and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations show that certain rupture phase can propagate backward relative to the earlier one during a single earthquake event. Such back-propagating rupture (BPR) was not well considered by the conventional earthquake source studies and remains a mystery to the seismological community. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of BPR, by combining theoretical considerations, numerical simulations, and observational evidences. First, we argue that BPR in terms of back-propagating stress wave is an intrinsic feature during dynamic ruptures; however, its signature can be easily masked by the destructive interference behind the primary rupture front. Then, we propose an idea that perturbation to an otherwise smooth rupture process may make some phases of BPR observable. We test and verify this idea by numerically simulating rupture propagation under a variety of perturbations, including a sudden change of stress, bulk or interfacial property and fault geometry along rupture propagation path. We further cross-validate the numerical results by available observations from laboratory and natural earthquakes, and confirm that rupture "reflection" at free surface, rupture coalescence and breakage of prominent asperity are very efficient for exciting observable BPR. Based on the simulated and observed results, we classify BPR into two general types: interface wave and high-order re-rupture, depending on the stress recovery and drop before and after the arrival of BPR, respectively. Our work clarifies the nature and excitation of BPR, and can help improve the understanding of earthquake physics, the inference of fault property distribution and evolution, and the assessment of earthquake hazard.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of polymer condensation, i.e. the formation of bonds between reactive end-groups, is ubiquitous in both industry and biology. Here we study generic systems undergoing polymer condensation in competition with cyclisation. Using a generalised Smoluchowski theory, molecular dynamics simulations and experiments using DNA and T4 ligase, we find that this system displays a transition, from a regime with finite-length chains at infinite time and dominated by rings to one dominated by linear polymers that grow in time. Finally, we show that fluids prepared close to the transition may have profoundly different compositions and rheology at large condensation times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions using particle-based simulation, mapping the viscosity as a function of the size ratio of the species, their relative abundance, and the overall solid content. The variation of the viscosity with applied stress exhibits shear thickening phenomenology irrespective of composition, though the stress-dependent limiting solids fraction governing the viscosity and its divergence point are non-monotonic in the mixing ratio. Contact force data demonstrate an asymmetric exchange in dominant stress contribution from large-large to small-small particle contacts as the mixing ratio of the species evolves. Combining a prior model for shear thickening with one for composition-dependent jamming, we obtain a full description of the rheology of bidisperse non-Brownian suspensions capable of predicting effects such as the viscosity reduction observed upon adding small particle fines to a suspension of large particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After rainfall, pine needles are observed to float on the surface of small puddles. As the water evaporates, these pine needles exhibit spontaneous self-assembly into distinct clusters. Motivated by this natural phenomenon, we conducted experimental investigations into the dynamic evolution of particles during the shrinkage of a liquid surface. Our experiments revealed that particles tend to aggregate, forming distinct clusters as the liquid boundary shrinks. We systematically examined the emergence of these clusters and explored how their sizes and numbers evolve with changes in packing fraction. Furthermore, we analyze particle rotation during the process and discuss the formation of the final configuration comprising clusters of various orientations. Complementary numerical simulations demonstrate qualitative agreement with our experimental findings. Our study contributes to a better understanding of self-assembly phenomena involving macroscopic particles on shrinking liquid surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Unleashing the predictive power of molecular dynamics (MD), Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are revolutionizing our ability to simulate chemical systems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Electrolyte solutions are a natural initial system to apply this tool to because they are critically important for a wide range of applications and their properties cannot currently be predicted. Unfortunately, however most DFT approximations are not sufficiently accurate to predict many practically relevant properties of electrolytes. Additionally, tracking the position of every atom in a system during molecular simulations is inherently limited, even with NNP-MD. Here, we use a state-of-the-art DFT approximation to demonstrate highly accurate all-atom NNPs with minimal training data. We demonstrate that NNPs can reliably be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained continuum solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales. We apply our technique to simulate lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium bromide in water. We reproduce key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these solutions in agreement with experimental data. The formation of a previously unknown Li cation dimer is observed, along with identical anion-anion interactions of chloride and bromide. Finally, the coarse-grained model is capable of reproducing crystal phase behavior and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained solely on moderate concentration solutions, disproving the notion that NNPs are only useful for interpolation. This approach should be scalable to determine the properties of electrolyte solutions over a much wider range of conditions and compositions than is possible experimentally.</description>

      <title>Emergence of large-scale mechanical spiral waves in bacterial living matter</title>

Abstract: Propagating spiral waves have been discovered in various chemical, biological and physical systems. Spiral waves in multicellular organisms are often associated with essential living functions. Although certain eukaryotic microorganisms have long been known to generate spiral waves, evidence of spiral wave pattern has not been lacking in the bacterial world. Here we report the discovery of a unique form of propagating spiral waves in dense bacterial populations where cells engage in cyclic force-generating processes driven by type-IV pilus motility. Specifically, we discovered that synchronization of pilus activity in the bacterial living matter leads to large-scale spatiotemporal regulation of tension force in the form of propagating spiral waves. Theoretical modelling reveals that the spiral tension waves result from nonreciprocity in cell-cell interactions. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of large-scale force regulation in bacterial world and may shed light on the emergent mechanics of biofilms and microbiomes. Pilus-driven bacterial living matter also provides a mechanical active medium for studying electrical or chemical spiral waves in living systems.</description>

      <title>Active particle motion in Poiseuille flow through rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07420</link>

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a point-like active particle suspended in fluid flow through a straight channel. For this particle-fluid system, we derive a constant of motion for a general unidirectional fluid flow, and apply it to an approximation of Poiseuille flow through channels with rectangular cross-sections. We obtain a $4$D nonlinear conservative dynamical system with one constant of motion and a dimensionless parameter describing the ratio of maximum flow speed to intrinsic active particle speed. Applied to square channels, we observe a diverse set of active particle trajectories with variations in system parameters and initial conditions which we classify into different types of swinging, trapping, tumbling and wandering motion. Regular (periodic/quasiperiodic) motion as well as chaotic active particle motion are observed for these trajectories and quantified using largest Lyapunov exponents. We explore the transition to chaotic motion using Poincar\'e maps and show ``sticky" chaotic tumbling trajectories that have long transients near a periodic state. We briefly illustrate how these results extend to rectangular cross-sections with width/height ratio larger than one. Outcomes of this work may have implications for dynamics of natural and artificial microswimmers in experimental microfluidic channels that typically have rectangular cross-sections.</description>
