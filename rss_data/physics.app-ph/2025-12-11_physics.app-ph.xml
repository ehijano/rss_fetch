      <title>Solvent-Directed Femtosecond Laser Ablation: Tuning Phase and Defect Engineering in Hybrid CdPS3/CdS Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limited visible-light absorption of wide-bandgap van der Waals crystals fundamentally restricts their utility in solar energy conversion. Here, we report a surfactant-free, solvent-directed laser synthesis strategy to engineer the phase and optoelectronic properties of Cadmium Phosphorus Trisulfide (CdPS3). By exploiting the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate a tunable transition from the stoichiometric ternary phase to a highly active binary-rich heterostructure. While ablation in water preserves the monoclinic CdPS3 lattice, the reducing environment of isopropanol triggers the formation of CdS quantum dots and metallic cadmium defect sites. This solvent-induced phase engineering transforms the ultraviolet-active host into a robust visible-light photocatalyst. The resulting hybrid CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids exhibit superior charge separation efficiency, driven by Schottky-like metal-semiconductor junctions, achieving ~ 90% degradation of Methylene Blue under 532 nm irradiation within 30 minutes. This work establishes fs-PLAL as a scalable defect-engineering tool for complex ternary layered materials, offering a new design of high-performance metal-thiophosphate-based photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Beta-Ga2O3 Sub-Micron FinFETs with Si Delta-Doped Channel Modulating Charge Density Above 3x10^13 cm^-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter reports on the design and demonstration of high-performance Beta-Ga2O3 FinFETs utilizing MOCVD-grown Si delta-doped channels to achieve enhanced carrier transport and electrostatic control. A record high sheet charge density of 3.3x10^13 cm^-2 was modulated using 100 nm fin channels, delivering a peak drain current of 410 mA/mm and a peak transconductance of 60 mS/mm. The FinFET architecture enables strong gate modulation, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio between 10^8 and 10^9. A low contact resistance of 0.42 ohm.mm was achieved to the Si delta-doped channel using MOCVD contact regrowth. Small-signal RF characterization revealed a current-gain cutoff frequency (fT) of 3.8 GHz and a maximum oscillation frequency (fMAX) of 2.1 GHz for a 0.8-micrometer gate length. These results demonstrate the efficacy of combining precision delta-doping with a 3D FinFET geometry for high-frequency Beta-Ga2O3 electronics, establishing a platform for future RF and high-power applications</description>

      <title>Thin-film magnomechanics in the low gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent interaction between magnons and phonons in the low-GHz regime represents an unexplored frontier in hybrid magnonics, critical for quantum information processing and microwave-to-acoustic transduction. While previous studies have focused on higher frequencies (&gt;5 GHz), we demonstrate magnon-phonon coupling near 2 GHz using spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) waveguides integrated with yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin films of varying thicknesses. SSPP waveguides provide strong slow-wave enhancement, enabling efficient magnon readout in this challenging regime. Systematic measurements reveal the dependence of coupling strength on YIG thickness and phonon wavelength matching, achieving cooperativity C = 1 for a 3 $\mu$m film at 2 GHz. Angle-dependent studies uncover coupling to both transverse and longitudinal phonon modes. Further investigation shows that thicker films exhibit rich multimode dynamics between high-order magnons and HBAR phonons. These results establish a robust low-GHz magnomechanical platform, opening pathways for multimode quantum transduction and hardware-efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Innovation ARIMA models application to predict pressure variations in water supply networks with open-loop control. Case study in Noja (Cantabria, Spain)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water utilities are increasingly concerned about losses, leaks, and illegal connections in their distribution networks. Pressure control is typically managed through pressure reducing valves with electrically controlled actuators based on predefined tables according to the pressure at the critical point control. This openloop control method lacks direct feedback between the PRV and CPC, making it challenging to distinguish whether pressure variations originate from normal head losses or abnormal network conditions. Unlike traditional applications of ARIMA focused on water demand forecasting, this study explores its novel use in pressure management within distribution networks, aiming to predict P3 pressure based on head losses across a defined hydraulic sector. To achieve this objective, a predictive model based on the Box-Jenkins methodology and its variations is implemented to analyse time series data. An action path is established to determine the optimal model ARIMA, ARMA, ARMAX, etc. which is subsequently validated using real operational data from Noja, a coastal town in northern Spain characterized by significant seasonal population fluctuations. By accurately forecasting CPC pressure, this system enhances the detection of anomalous patterns, enabling more efficient network pressure management. The study demonstrates the potential of advanced modelling techniques in optimizing water distribution networks, providing valuable insights to improve system efficiency, reliability, and sustainability in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Comparison of time-resolved photoluminescence and deep-level transient spectroscopy defect evaluations in an InAs nBn detector subjected to in-situ and ex-situ 63 MeV proton irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-level transient spectroscopy and temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence experiments are performed on identical InAs nBn photodetector structures as a function of in-situ and ex-situ 63 MeV proton irradiation to assess their generation and recombination dynamics. Pre-irradiation, the n-type InAs absorbing region exhibits a steadily increasing minority carrier lifetime with increasing temperature, providing evidence that excited minority carriers may be recombining via shallow defect levels. From deep-level transient spectroscopy, two features are found between 10 K and 275 K: a low temperature broad shoulder, which suggests emission from multiple shallow electron defect levels with energies &lt; 29 meV, and a high temperature minimum occurring at approximately 230 K with an activation energy of 539 meV, which suggests a defect in the barrier layer in the device. Two similar nBn detectors are then subjected to 63 MeV proton irradiation in step doses and measured between steps. One experiment is performed in-situ with an nBn held at approximately 10 K during dosing, and the other experiment is performed ex-situ with a similar nBn held at room temperature for dosing. The ex-situ dosing results in an evaluation of the defect introduction rate that is 3-4x lower than in-situ due to partial annealing of the proton-induced displacement damage at room temperature. The results for these two experiments are then compared with the dose-dependent recombination rate analysis, resulting in an estimated recombination defect cross-section of 1.6x10^(-14) cm^2 for the shallow shoulder defect.</description>

      <title>Tether-Based Architecture for Solar-Powered Orbital AI Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a tether-based structural architecture for orbital data centers operating in Dawn-Dusk Sun-Synchronous (DDSS) orbits under continuous sunlight. These space-based data centers, powered solely by solar energy, could provide multi-megawatt computing for artificial intelligence (AI) inference with minimal latency to Earth. The proposed design uses a tethered chain of computing nodes with photovoltaic panels to achieve uninterrupted 2-20 MW of computing power, and employs radiative cooling and integrated shielding to manage heat and radiation. We detail the system architecture, including mass budgets, passive attitude control, and the dynamics induced by micrometeoroid collisions.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Sliding Switch in a 90-nm-Wide Nanostructured Chiral Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, renowned for their fascinating electromagnetic properties, hold potential for next-generation topological spintronic devices. Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Predicting tunable nonreciprocal spin wave generation mediated by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnonic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called "overlap function" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region.</description>

      <title>Scalable van der Waals Photonics: High-Refractive-Index Gallium Sulfide Films with Single-Crystal Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of high-refractive-index dielectrics into scalable photonic architectures is foundational to advancing integrated circuits and augmented reality (AR) displays. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exceptional optical properties, including high refractive indices and giant anisotropy, but their implementation is constrained by the small area and uncontrolled thickness of mechanically exfoliated flakes. Here, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown gallium sulfide (GaS) overcomes the trade-off between high optical performance and manufacturability, emerging as a large-scale vdW dielectric platform. Through rigorous optical and structural benchmarking against pristine single crystals, we establish that the optical constants (n, k) of ALD-GaS are virtually indistinguishable from single-crystal counterparts. By leveraging the retained out-of-plane anisotropy, we demonstrate that ALD-GaS enables superior suppression of crosstalk in densely integrated waveguides compared to conventional scalable high-index platforms. Our findings establish ALD-GaS as a technologically viable pathway for implementing anisotropic vdW materials in visible-spectrum photonics.</description>

      <title>Single-crystalline high-quality beta-Ga2O3 pseudo-substrate on sapphire through sputtering for epitaxial deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-phase epitaxy (SPE) of beta-Ga2O3 thin films by radio-frequency (RF) sputtering and then crystallized through high-temperature post-deposition annealing is employed on sapphire substrates, yielding a high-quality pseudo-substrate for subsequent buffer growth via MOCVD and LPCVD. Low roughness (&lt;0.5 nm) and sharp single-crystalline diffraction peaks corresponding to the (-201), (-402), and (-603) reflections of beta-Ga2O3 were observed in the SPE beta-Ga2O3 film and the subsequent epitaxial buffer layer. N-doped Ga2O3 film on SPE Ga2O3 film grown by LPCVD showed step-assisted growth mode with reasonable electronic behavior with 45 cm^2/V-s mobility at a bulk carrier concentration of 1.3e17 cm^-3. These results suggest that SPE Ga2O3 is a promising pathway to advance the development of beta-Ga2O3 on foreign substrates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-k (115), crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) thin film was transferred on GaN for potential applications in power devices (transistor and diodes) by nanomembrane transfer method and the detailed electrical properties such as leakage current, CV profiles, dielectric constant, frequency dispersion was reported from fabricated MOSCAP structures. The leakage current was negligible (under noise-level of tool) up to 6 V and 11 V for 50 nm and 200 nm STO membrane respectively A high-quality dielectric was indicated by the CV profile, which showed almost negligible frequency dispersion in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 500 kHz. The dielectric constant was 50 to 82 with the 50 nm thick STO membrane and 115 to 186 in the 200 nm thick STO membrane. Thermal annealing of the membrane in ambient conditions at 250 degrees for 2 hours led to a slight improvement in the dielectric constant (8 to 20 percent), albeit at the expense of degraded leakage current performance, as indicated by a reduction of 1 V to 3 V in the "no leakage region" of the IV curves after annealing. The possible physical mechanisms responsible for these changes were also analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Avalanches of choice: how stranger-to-stranger interactions shape crowd dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pedestrian routing choices play a crucial role in shaping collective crowd dynamics, yet the influence of interactions among unfamiliar individuals remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.</description>

      <title>Checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice States in Overdoped Cuprate Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cuprate superconductors remain central to condensed matter physics due to their technological relevance and unconventional, incompletely understood electronic behavior. While the canonical phase diagram and low-energy models have been shaped largely by studies of underdoped and moderately doped cuprates, the overdoped regime has received comparatively limited attention.Here, we track the evolution of the electronic structure from optimal to heavy overdoping in La2-xSrxCuO4(LSCO) using broadband optical spectroscopy across x=0.15-0.60. The measured spectral changes--including the redistribution of Zhang-Rice-related spectral weigh--are in qualitative agreement with determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the three-orbital Emery model, which together indicate a pronounced reconstruction of the electronic structure beyond hole concentrations x&gt;0.2. Guided by these observations, we propose a spontaneous checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice electronic configuration that captures the coexistence of itinerant and localized carriers characteristic of the heavily overdoped state. Our results refine the doping-dependent Zhang-Rice-based framework for cuprates, illuminate how correlations persist deep into the overdoped regime, and provide new constraints on microscopic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity, with broader implications for correlated transition-metal oxides.</description>

      <title>SiNx RRAMs performance with different stoichiometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microstructure of SiNx is strongly affected by its stoichiometry, x. The stoichiometry of SiNx thin films can be modified by adjusting the gas flow rates during LPCVD deposition. The deficiency or excess of Si atoms enhance the formation of defects such as nitrogen vacancies, silicon dangling bonds etc., and thus can enable performance tuning of the resulting MIS RRAM devices. DC electrical characterization, impedance spectroscopy and constant voltage stress measurements were carried out to investigate the properties of non-stoichiometric silicon nitride films as resistive switching material. The average SET time for each device was measured by applying voltage ramps. Improvement in the SET/RESET voltages and SET time is observed. Finally, the stoichiometric film exhibits the lowest breakdown acceleration factor, while the Si-rich film the highest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the resistive switching characteristics of LPCVD SiNx MNOS ReRAM cells on both heavily doped n- and p-type silicon substrates, focusing on the effects of nitrogen doping. Detailed comparisons of electrical properties through nitrogen implantation reveal variations in trap density and SET-RESET voltages between n and p conductivity Si substrates.

      <title>Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of SiO$_2$/TiO$_2$ Heterostructures Grown by Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition</title>

Abstract: Second harmonic (SH) radiation can only be generated in non-centrosymmetric bulk crystals under the electric-dipole approximation. Nonlinear thin films made from bulk crystals are technologically challenging because of complex and high temperature fabrication processes. In this work, heterostructures made of amorphous materials SiO$_2$ and TiO$_2$ were prepared by a CMOS-compatible technique named plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with deposition temperature at 100 {\deg}C. By using the uniaxial dispersion model, we characterized the form-birefringence properties, which can enable the phase matching condition in waveguides or other nonlinear optical applications. By applying a fringe-based technique, we determined the largest diagonal component of the effective second-order bulk susceptibility $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ = 1.30$\pm$0.13 pm/V at a wavelength of 1032 nm. Noteworthy, we observed strong SH signals from two-component nanolaminates, which are several orders of magnitude larger than from single layers. The SH signals from our samples only require the broken inversion symmetry at the interface. Here optical properties of nanocomposites can be precisely tuned by the promising PEALD technology.</description>

      <title>Noise dynamics in large mode volume Brillouin lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated Brillouin lasers have emerged as an important tool to realize a wide range of precision applications, including atomic time-keeping, low-noise microwave signal generation, fiber and quantum sensing, and ultra-high capacity coherent communications. While Brillouin lasers routinely achieve sub-Hz instantaneous linewidths, many of these applications also require exceptional frequency stability and high-power single-mode emission. A recent demonstration showed that extending the resonator length increases the laser power while also improving the frequency stability through suppression of thermorefractive noise. However, as the resonator scales to larger lengths, multiple optical resonances can be found within the Brillouin gain bandwidth, greatly complicating the laser dynamics compared to existing coupled-mode Brillouin laser models. Given the potential to scale lasers of this type to watt-level output powers at sub-mHz linewidths, a theoretical model describing this physics is needed to provide key insights into their performance. Here, we develop a coupled-mode theory of integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers, accounting for multiple cavity modes with potential to lase within the gain bandwidth. We obtain expressions for the steady-state dynamics, spontaneous spectrum, relative intensity noise, and frequency noise. Our analysis reveals that the broad gain bandwidth results in atypical Brillouin dynamics, giving rise to distinct features in the noise spectra, and consequently modifications of the standard, single-mode fundamental linewidth of Brillouin lasers. Additionally, these features may be used for a variety of tangential applications, such as phonon spectroscopy or quality factor enhancement. Furthermore, we find that the linewidth can be significantly impacted by transferred RIN from the external pump in Brillouin lasers that lack ideal phase matching.</description>

      <title>An Euler-Lagrangian Multiphysics Coupling Framework for Particle-Laden High-Speed Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-laden effects in high-speed flows require a coupled Euler and Lagrangian prediction technique with varying fidelity of thermochemical models, depending on the simulation conditions of interest. This requirement makes the development of a conventional monolithic solver challenging to manage the different fidelity of the thermochemical models within a single computational framework. To address this, the present study proposes a multi-solver framework for the coupled Euler-Lagrangian predictions applicable to various particle-laden high-speed flow conditions. Volumetric and surface couplings are established between a particle solver ORACLE (OpenFOAM-based lagRAngian CoupLEr) and a thermochemical nonequilibrium flow solver based on an adaptable data exchange algorithm. The developed framework is then validated by predicting particle-laden supersonic nozzle flows and aerothermal heating around a hypersonic Martian atmospheric entry capsule. Finally, a quasi-1D approximation is proposed in conjunction with a surrogate method to efficiently and accurately predict particle-laden surface erosion, with quantified parametric uncertainty, for hypersonic aerothermal characterization.</description>
