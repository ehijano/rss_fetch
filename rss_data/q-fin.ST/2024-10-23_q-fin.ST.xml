      <title>Functional Clustering of Discount Functions for Behavioral Investor Profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical finance models are based on the premise that investors act rationally and utilize all available information when making portfolio decisions. However, these models often fail to capture the anomalies observed in intertemporal choices and decision-making under uncertainty, particularly when accounting for individual differences in preferences and consumption patterns. Such limitations hinder traditional finance theory's ability to address key questions like: How do personal preferences shape investment choices? What drives investor behaviour? And how do individuals select their portfolios? One prominent contribution is Pompian's model of four Behavioral Investor Types (BITs), which links behavioural finance studies with Keirsey's temperament theory, highlighting the role of personality in financial decision-making. Yet, traditional parametric models struggle to capture how these distinct temperaments influence intertemporal decisions, such as how individuals evaluate trade-offs between present and future outcomes. To address this gap, the present study employs Functional Data Analysis (FDA) to specifically investigate temporal discounting behaviours revealing nuanced patterns in how different temperaments perceive and manage uncertainty over time. Our findings show heterogeneity within each temperament, suggesting that investor profiles are far more diverse than previously thought. This refined classification provides deeper insights into the role of temperament in shaping intertemporal financial decisions, offering practical implications for financial advisors to better tailor strategies to individual risk preferences and decision-making styles.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Spatiotemporal and Network ARCH Model with Common Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic spatiotemporal volatility model that extends traditional approaches by incorporating spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal spillover effects, along with volatility-specific observed and latent factors. The model offers a more general network interpretation, making it applicable for studying various types of network spillovers. The primary innovation lies in incorporating volatility-specific latent factors into the dynamic spatiotemporal volatility model. Using Bayesian estimation via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the model offers a robust framework for analyzing the spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal effects of a log-squared outcome variable on its volatility. We recommend using the deviance information criterion (DIC) and a regularized Bayesian MCMC method to select the number of relevant factors in the model. The model's flexibility is demonstrated through two applications: a spatiotemporal model applied to the U.S. housing market and another applied to financial stock market networks, both highlighting the model's ability to capture varying degrees of interconnectedness. In both applications, we find strong spatial/network interactions with relatively stronger spillover effects in the stock market.</description>

      <title>Dynamic graph neural networks for enhanced volatility prediction in financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Volatility forecasting is essential for risk management and decision-making in financial markets. Traditional models like Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) effectively capture volatility clustering but often fail to model complex, non-linear interdependencies between multiple indices. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to represent global financial markets as dynamic graphs. The Temporal Graph Attention Network (Temporal GAT) combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to capture the temporal and structural dynamics of volatility spillovers. By utilizing correlation-based and volatility spillover indices, the Temporal GAT constructs directed graphs that enhance the accuracy of volatility predictions. Empirical results from a 15-year study of eight major global indices show that the Temporal GAT outperforms traditional GARCH models and other machine learning methods, particularly in short- to mid-term forecasts. The sensitivity and scenario-based analysis over a range of parameters and hyperparameters further demonstrate the significance of the proposed technique. Hence, this work highlights the potential of GNNs in modeling complex market behaviors, providing valuable insights for financial analysts and investors.</description>

      <title>Beyond Trading Data: The Hidden Influence of Public Awareness and Interest on Cryptocurrency Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Bitcoin first appeared on the scene in 2009, cryptocurrencies have become a worldwide phenomenon as important decentralized financial assets. Their decentralized nature, however, leads to notable volatility against traditional fiat currencies, making the task of accurately forecasting the crypto-fiat exchange rate complex. This study examines the various independent factors that affect the volatility of the Bitcoin-Dollar exchange rate. To this end, we propose CoMForE, a multimodal AdaBoost-LSTM ensemble model, which not only utilizes historical trading data but also incorporates public sentiments from related tweets, public interest demonstrated by search volumes, and blockchain hash-rate data. Our developed model goes a step further by predicting fluctuations in the overall cryptocurrency value distribution, thus increasing its value for investment decision-making. We have subjected this method to extensive testing via comprehensive experiments, thereby validating the importance of multimodal combination over exclusive reliance on trading data. Further experiments show that our method significantly surpasses existing forecasting tools and methodologies, demonstrating a 19.29% improvement. This result underscores the influence of external independent factors on cryptocurrency volatility.</description>

      <title>Predicting Value at Risk for Cryptocurrencies With Generalized Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.08224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prediction of Value at Risk (VaR) for cryptocurrencies. In contrast to classic assets, returns of cryptocurrencies are often highly volatile and characterized by large fluctuations around single events. Analyzing a comprehensive set of 105 major cryptocurrencies, we show that Generalized Random Forests (GRF) (Athey, Tibshirani &amp; Wager, 2019) adapted to quantile prediction have superior performance over other established methods such as quantile regression, GARCH-type and CAViaR models. This advantage is especially pronounced in unstable times and for classes of highly-volatile cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, we identify important predictors during such times and show their influence on forecasting over time. Moreover, a comprehensive simulation study also indicates that the GRF methodology is at least on par with existing methods in VaR predictions for standard types of financial returns and clearly superior in the cryptocurrency setup.</description>
