      <title>A Non-Variational Quantum Approach to the Job Shop Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum heuristics offer a potential advantage for combinatorial optimization but are constrained by near-term hardware limitations. We introduce Iterative-QAOA, a variant of QAOA designed to mitigate these constraints. The algorithm combines a non-variational, shallow-depth circuit approach using fixed-parameter schedules with an iterative warm-starting process. We benchmark the algorithm on Just-in-Time Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JIT-JSSP) instances on IonQ Forte Generation QPUs, representing some of the largest such problems ever executed on quantum hardware. We compare the performance of the algorithm against both the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQITE) algorithm and the non-variational Linear Ramp (LR) QAOA algorithm. We find that Iterative-QAOA robustly converges to find optimal solutions as well as high-quality, near-optimal solutions for all problem instances evaluated. We evaluate the algorithm on larger problem instances up to 97 qubits using tensor network simulations. The scaling behavior of the algorithm indicates potential for solving industrial-scale problems on fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Estimates of Displacement in Disaster Regions: A Policy-driven framework triangulating data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While traditional data systems remain fundamental to humanitarian response, they often lack the real-time responsiveness and spatial precision needed to capture increasingly complex patterns of displacement. Internal displacement reached an unprecedented 83.4 million people by the end of 2024, underscoring the urgent need for innovative, data driven approaches to monitor and understand population movements. This report examines how integrating traditional data sources with emerging digital trace data, such as mobile phone GPS and social media activity, can enhance the accuracy, responsiveness, and granularity of displacement monitoring. Drawing on lessons from recent crises, including the escalation of the war in Ukraine and the 2022 floods in Pakistan, the report presents a structured pilot effort that tests the triangulation of multiple data streams to produce more robust and reliable displacement estimates. Statistical indicators derived from digital trace data are benchmarked against the International Organisation for Migration, Displacement Tracking Matrix datasets, to assess their validity, transparency, and scalability. The findings demonstrate how triangulated data approaches can deliver real-time, high-resolution insights into population movements, improving humanitarian resource allocation and intervention planning. The report includes a scalable framework for crisis monitoring that leverages digital innovation to strengthen humanitarian data systems and support evidence-based decision-making in complex emergencies.</description>

      <title>GPoS: Geospatially-aware Proof of Stake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geospatial decentralization is essential for blockchains, ensuring regulatory resilience, robustness, and fairness. We empirically analyze five major Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains: Aptos, Avalanche, Ethereum, Solana, and Sui, revealing that a few geographic regions dominate consensus voting power, resulting in limited geospatial decentralization. To address this, we propose Geospatially aware Proof of Stake (GPoS), which integrates geospatial diversity with stake-based voting power. Experimental evaluation demonstrates an average 45% improvement in geospatial decentralization, as measured by the Gini coefficient of Eigenvector centrality, while incurring minimal performance overhead in BFT protocols, including HotStuff and CometBFT. These results demonstrate that GPoS can improve geospatial decentralization {while, in our experiments, incurring minimal overhead} to consensus performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Continuous-variable Quantum Neural Networks for Biomedical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum computing offers a promising framework for scalable quantum machine learning, leveraging optical systems with infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. While discrete-variable (DV) quantum neural networks have shown remarkable progress in various computer vision tasks, CV quantum models remain comparatively underexplored. In this work, we present a feasibility study of continuous-variable quantum neural networks (CV-QCNNs) applied to biomedical image classification. Utilizing photonic circuit simulation frameworks, we construct CV quantum circuits composed of Gaussian gates, such as displacement, squeezing, rotation, and beamsplitters to emulate convolutional behavior. Our experiments are conducted on the MedMNIST dataset collection, a set of annotated medical image benchmarks for multiple diagnostic tasks. We evaluate CV-QCNN's performance in terms of classification accuracy, model expressiveness, and resilience to Gaussian noise, comparing against classical CNNs and equivalent DV quantum circuits. This study aims to identify trade-offs between DV and CV paradigms for quantum-enhanced medical imaging. Our results highlight the potential of continuous-variable models and their viability for future computer-aided diagnosis systems.</description>

      <title>Neural Network based Distance Estimation for Branched Molecular Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Communications (MC) is an emerging research paradigm that utilizes molecules to transmit information, with promising applications in biomedicine such as targeted drug delivery or tumor detection. It is also envisioned as a key enabler of the Internet of BioNanoThings (IoBNT). In this paper, we propose algorithms based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for the estimation of communication channel parameters in MC systems. We focus on a simple branched topology, simulating the molecule movement with a macroscopic MC simulator. The Deep Learning architectures proposed for distance estimation demonstrate strong performance within these branched environments, highlighting their potential for future MC applications.</description>

      <title>Can Foundation Models Revolutionize Mobile AR Sparse Sensing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms for the Generalized Assignment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms offer a compelling new avenue for addressing difficult NP-complete optimization problems, such as the Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP). Given the operational constraints of contemporary Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, hybrid quantum-classical approaches, specifically Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), promises to be effective approaches to solve real-world optimization problems. This paper proposes an approach, named VQGAP, designed to efficiently solve the GAP by optimizing quantum resources and reducing the required parametrized quantum circuit width with respect to standard VQE. The main idea driving our proposal is to decouple the qubits of ansatz circuits from the binary variables of the General Assignment Problem, by providing encoding/decoding functions transforming the solutions generated by ansatze in the limited quantum space in feasible solutions in the problem variables space, by exploiting the constraints of the problem. Preliminary results, obtained through both noiseless and noisy simulations, indicate that VQGAP exhibits performance and behavior very similar to VQE, while effectively reducing the number of qubits and circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Tactile Displays Driven by Projected Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile displays that lend tangible form to digital content could transform computing interactions. However, achieving the resolution, speed, and dynamic range needed for perceptual fidelity remains challenging. We present a tactile display that directly converts projected light into visible tactile patterns via a photomechanical surface populated with millimeter-scale optotactile pixels. The pixels transduce incident light into mechanical displacements through photostimulated thermal gas expansion, yielding millimeter scale displacements with response times of 2 to 100 milliseconds. Employing projected light for power transmission and addressing renders these displays highly scalable. We demonstrate optically driven displays with up to 1,511 addressable pixels -- several times more pixels than any prior tactile display attaining comparable performance. Perceptual studies confirm that these displays can reproduce diverse spatiotemporal tactile patterns with high fidelity. This research establishes a foundation for practical, versatile high-resolution tactile displays driven by light.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Investigation of Crosstalk in Bent Microstrip Lines with Partial and Apertured Shielding: Simulations and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an electromagnetic investigation of the crosstalk between two bent microstrip lines (MLs) separated by a perforated planar shield. As an extension of our previous study, the effects of various discontinuities in either the MLs or the shield along the coupling path are analyzed through numerical simulations and validated by measurements. The underlying electromagnetic mechanisms are also discussed. Furthermore, multimodal wave theory in a rectangular waveguide is applied to predict crosstalk behavior when the shield contains an aperture. This study aims to conceptually elucidate complex crosstalk phenomena that are difficult to model using circuit theory, and successful predictions of crosstalk behavior are presented for different problem cases.</description>

      <title>MM-2FSK: Multimodal Frequency Shift Keying for Ultra-Efficient and Robust High-Resolution MIMO Radar Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of static and rapidly moving targets demands three-dimensional imaging solutions with high temporal and spatial resolution. Radar sensors are a promising sensing modality because of their fast capture rates and their independence from lighting conditions. To achieve high spatial resolution, MIMO radars with large apertures are required. Yet, they are infrequently used for dynamic scenarios due to significant limitations in signal processing algorithms. These limitations impose substantial hardware constraints due to their computational intensity and reliance on large signal bandwidths, ultimately restricting the sensor's capture rate.
  One solution of previous work is to use few frequencies only, which enables faster capture and requires less computation; however, this requires coarse knowledge of the target's position and works in a limited depth range only. To address these challenges, we extend previous work into the multimodal domain with MM-2FSK, which leverages an assistive optical depth sensing modality to obtain a depth prior, enabling high framerate capture with only few frequencies.
  We evaluate our method using various target objects with known ground truth geometry that is spatially registered to real millimeter-wave MIMO radar measurements. Our method demonstrates superior performance in terms of depth quality, being able to compete with the time- and resource-intensive measurements with many frequencies.</description>
