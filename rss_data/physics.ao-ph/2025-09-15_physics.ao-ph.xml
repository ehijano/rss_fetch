      <title>DeepSeasons: a Deep Learning scale-selecting approach to Seasonal Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal forecasting remains challenging due to the inherent chaotic nature of atmospheric dynamics. This paper introduces DeepSeasons, a novel deep learning approach designed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of seasonal forecasts. Leveraging advanced neural network architectures and extensive historical climatic datasets, DeepSeasons identifies complex, nonlinear patterns and dependencies in climate variables with similar or improved skill respcet GCM-based forecasting methods, at a significant lower cost. The framework also allow tailored application to specific regions or variables, rather than the overall problem of predicting the entire atmosphere/ocean system. The proposed methods also allow for direct predictions of anomalies and time-means, opening a new approach to long-term forecasting and highlighting its potential for operational deployment in climate-sensitive sectors. This innovative methodology promises substantial improvements in managing climate-related risks and decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>How does an AI Weather Model Learn to Forecast Extreme Weather?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a warming climate with more frequent severe weather, artificial intelligence (AI) weather models have the potential to provide cheaper, faster, and more accurate forecasts of high-impact weather events. To realize this potential, there is a need for more research on how models learn extreme events and how that learning might be improved. We investigate how a spherical Fourier neural operator model (SFNO) learns extreme weather by saving every checkpoint throughout training and analyzing a collection of 9 extreme weather events including heatwaves, atmospheric rivers, and tropical cyclones. The SFNO learns heatwaves similarly to other weather days, but we find evidence that the model learns information about atmospheric river and tropical cyclone forecasts that it loses later in training. We propose a possible training strategy to improve the forecasting of extreme events by retaining information from earlier training checkpoints, and provide initial evidence of its utility.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modelling of atmosphere-surface coupling with a copula Bayesian network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land-atmosphere coupling is an important process for correctly modelling near-surface temperature profiles, but it involves various uncertainties due to subgrid-scale processes, such as turbulent fluxes or unresolved surface heterogeneities, suggesting a probabilistic modelling approach. We develop a copula Bayesian network (CBN) to interpolate temperature profiles, acting as alternative to T2m-diagnostics used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. The new CBN results in (1) a reduction of the warm bias inherent to NWP predictions of wintertime stable boundary layers allowing cold temperature extremes to be better represented, and (2) consideration of uncertainty associated with subgrid-scale spatial variability. The use of CBNs combines the advantages of uncertainty propagation inherent to Bayesian networks with the ability to model complex dependence structures between random variables through copulas. By combining insights from copula modelling and information entropy, criteria for the applicability of CBNs in the further development of parameterizations in NWP models are derived.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous soil moisture fields suppress Sahelian MCS frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding controls on Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) is critical for predicting rainfall extremes across scales. Spatial variability of soil moisture (SM) presents such a control, with $\sim$200km dry patches in the Sahel observed to intensify mature MCSs. Here we test MCS sensitivity to spatial scales of surface heterogeneity using a framework of experiments initialised from scale-filtered SM. We demonstrate the control of SM heterogeneity on MCS populations, and the mechanistic chain via which spatial variability propagates through surface fluxes to convective boundary layer development and storm environments. When all sub-synoptic SM variability is homogenised, peak MCS counts drop by 23%, whereas maintaining small-scale variability yields a weaker decrease due to higher primary initiation. In sensitivity experiments, boundary layer development prior to MCSs is similar to that over mesoscale dry SM anomalies, but instead driven by diffuse cloud-free slots of increased shortwave radiation. This reduces storm numbers and potential predictability.</description>

      <title>Sea ice floe segmentation in close-range optical imagery using active contour and foundation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The size of sea ice floes in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) is a key factor influencing ice coverage, albedo, wave propagation through ice-covered waters, and ocean--atmosphere energy exchanges. Floe size can be observed by processing visual-range imagery from ships, aircraft, or satellites. However, autonomously capturing floe boundaries from imagery remains challenging, particularly due to the heterogeneity of sea ice, which impairs boundary definition and reduces image clarity. This study evaluates the accuracy of sea ice floe segmentation using the gradient vector flow (GVF) active contour method, the deep learning-based Segment Anything Model (SAM), and a hybrid approach combining GVF and SAM. These methods are evaluated on a representative subset of a large dataset of close-range, high-resolution sea ice imagery, collected from cameras aboard an icebreaker during an Antarctic winter expedition. Spanning a wide range of ice conditions and image clarity in the MIZ, the subset provides a rigorous test bed of segmentation approaches. Their performance is assessed in terms of floe detection accuracy, floe size distribution, and ice concentration, with results compared against a manually segmented benchmark. The findings indicate that SAM, when used in prompt-driven mode, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Its strong performance in estimating sea ice concentration and detecting floes, while maintaining close agreement with benchmark floe size distributions, makes it suitable for real-time applications and scalable analysis of large imagery datasets.</description>

      <title>Impact of Small-Scale Gravity Waves on Tracer Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small-scale gravity waves, with horizontal wavelengths of up to a few hundred kilometers and vertical wavelengths of up to a few kilometers, play a crucial role in atmospheric tracer transport. However, their effects remain unresolved in climate models and must be parameterized. This study investigates how gravity waves influence large-scale tracer distributions, utilizing a multiple-scale analysis to systematically identify the governing terms of gravity wave-induced tracer fluxes. The analysis reveals both leading-order and next-order impacts: the former being the inertia-gravity wave-induced tracer Stokes drift, which acts perpendicular to both the large-scale tracer gradient and the wave number, while the latter becomes significant at lower latitudes where Coriolis effects diminish. A numerical framework is developed to incorporate these fluxes into a gravity wave parameterization model, potentially enhancing climate model accuracy without requiring explicit resolution of small-scale wave dynamics. Model validation against high-resolution wave-resolving simulations confirms the effectiveness of this approach. By improving the representation of gravity wave-induced tracer transport, this research advances the accuracy of climate simulations, particularly in their depiction of microphysics and radiative processes.</description>

      <title>Realistic ENSO Dynamics Requires a Damped Nonlinear Recharge Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are succinctly captured by the Recharge Oscillator (RO) framework. However, to simulate ENSO realistically, careful choices must be made regarding the RO's key parameters. In particular, nonlinear parameters govern how well the model reproduces ENSO asymmetries-El Ni\~no events tend to be stronger but relatively short, often transitioning into La Ni\~na, whereas La Ni\~na events are typically weaker but may last longer. While amplitude asymmetry has been studied within the RO framework, duration and transition asymmetries remain less explored and their causes are debated. In this study, by systematically exploring the RO parameter space-rather than relying on commonly used fitting methods-we identify optimal parameter values that successfully capture key linear and nonlinear ENSO characteristics. In doing so, we revisit several foundational elements of the RO framework. First, we analytically derive the phase relationship between temperature and heat content anomalies, showing that it depends on the signs of the Bjerknes feedback and the ocean damping timescale. We show that self-sustained oscillations fail to reproduce the observed kurtosis of Ni\~no indices. We further derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum and argue that incorporating red noise forcing, rather than white noise, introduces unnecessary complexity. The most realistic yet simplest RO configuration is a strongly damped oscillator, with a decay timescale shorter than the dominant period, forced by multiplicative white noise and influenced by weak deterministic nonlinearities. Identifying these minimal components preserves the RO framework's clarity and isolates the core physical processes underlying ENSO behavior.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Turbulence Closures for Quasi-Geostrophic Ocean Flows with Coastal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.</description>

      <title>Structure-Preserving High-Order Methods for the Compressible Euler Equations in Potential Temperature Formulation for Atmospheric Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>
