      <title>Intrinsically Quantum Effects of Axion Dark Matter are Undetectable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is the usual treatment of axion dark matter as a classical field reliable? We show that the answer is subtle: the axion field could well be in a quantum state that has no complete classical description, but realistic detectors cannot tell the difference. To see this, we solve a fully quantum model of axion detection using quantum optics techniques. We show that intrinsically quantum effects are washed out by mode averaging or small amounts of noise, and significantly suppressed by the weakness of the axion coupling. Our work exemplifies that there should always be a classical analog for axion dark matter effects, extends to other wave (ultralight) dark-matter candidates, and gives a general method to compute the effects of exotic dark-matter states.</description>

      <title>Testing the arrow of time at the cosmo collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal particles carry a microscopic arrow of causality. Lee-Wick ghosts carry the reversed arrow, mediating characteristic collider signals in flat space: opposite-sign scattering amplitudes that violate positivity bounds; acausality on time scales set by their negative decay rate. During inflation, the corresponding cosmo-collider ghost signals are: opposite-sign non-Gaussianities; Boltzmann-unsuppressed local oscillatory signals without their non-local counterparts; IR-enhanced bi-spectrum and power spectrum, depending on the dimension of the interaction operator, which decreases if the ghost decay rate is comparable to the Hubble rate.</description>

      <title>DAMA/LIBRA and dark matter: decisive tension or contrived cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the tension between DAMA/LIBRA and the latest dark matter annual modulation results from the ANAIS-112 and COSINE-100 NaI experiments, under a range of hypotheses ranging from physical to general parameterisations. We find that, in the most physically-motivated cases, the tension between DAMA and these other NaI experiments exceeds 5$\sigma$. Lowering the tension to reasonable values requires significant tuning, such as overfitting with large numbers of free parameters, and opposite-sign modulation between recoil signals on sodium versus iodine.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes at the Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during first-order phase transitions provide a powerful link between the early-universe microphysics and observable signatures today, including dark matter and gravitational waves. In this work we develop a unified description of PBH formation based on the Israel junction conditions, which capture collapse dynamics without relying on conventional overdensity or pressure-balance arguments. As a first application, we show that exotic objects such as Fermi-balls can collapse into PBHs even when most of the vacuum energy is trapped in solitonic cores, leading to a different gravitational-wave signal relative to vacuum-only scenarios. As a second application, we study multiple phase transitions in a hidden sector, which generate correlated gravitational-wave spectra and PBH abundances across transitions. Our framework, while analytically controlled, is broadly applicable to hidden-sector models with general vacuum, radiation, and matter contributions. We present the resulting predictions for PBH mass spectra, dark matter fractions, and gravitational-wave signals, highlighting parameter regions that remain open in current searches and motivating future probes.</description>

      <title>Unitary perturbation theory on the light cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-cone perturbation theory is a powerful tool for calculating high-energy scattering amplitudes, particularly for quantum particles such as electrons, photons, or protons scattering off heavy nuclei, a process analogous to potential scattering. Central to these computations are the light-cone wave functions of incoming and outgoing particles, representing the projection of dressed initial and final states onto partonic Fock states. The dressed states are obtained by applying an evolution operator in the Dirac picture to bare partonic states, which may be interpreted physically as a time evolution from preparation to interaction. In standard approaches, a non-unitary operator is used, and proper normalization is imposed a posteriori. Here, we systematically develop perturbation theory from a perturbatively unitary evolution operator, using adiabatic switching to regularize the infinite-time limits. This provides a theoretically coherent framework for organizing calculations, reproducing known results entirely diagrammatically without enforcing unitarity by hand. We illustrate the method with a simple quantum mechanical model, enabling calculations to arbitrary perturbative orders, and then evaluate wave functions in field theories quantized on the light cone, focusing on a massive scalar theory with cubic interaction at one-loop accuracy.</description>

      <title>Feebly Interacting Particles: FIPs at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the establishment and maturation of the experimental programs searching for new physics with sizeable couplings at the LHC, there is an increasing interest in the broader particle and astrophysics community for exploring the physics of light and feebly-interacting particles as a paradigm complementary to a New Physics sector at the TeV scale and beyond. FIPs@LHCb continues the successful series of the FIPs workshops, FIPs 2020 and FIPs 2022. The main focus of the workshop was to explore the LHCb potential to search for FIPs thanks to the new software trigger deployed during the recent upgrade. Equally important goals of the workshop were to update the available parameter space in the commonly used FIPs benchmarks by including recent results from the high energy physics community and to discuss recent theory progress necessary for a more accurate definition of observables related to FIP benchmarks. This document presents the summary of the talks presented at the workshops and the outcome of subsequent discussions.</description>

      <title>The influence of invisible light particles on $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda E_{\mathrm{miss}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the contribution of invisible light particles to $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda E_{\mathrm{miss}}$, particularly the three-body decays $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \phi \bar\phi$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \psi \bar\psi$. The differential branching ratio of $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda E_{\mathrm{miss}}$ and the $q^2$-dependent longitudinal polarization asymmetry of $\Lambda$ in scenarios explaining the Belle II excess are presented. In the chiral basis, we investigate the correlations between $\mathcal{B}(B \to K E_{\mathrm{miss}})$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b \to \Lambda E_{\mathrm{miss}})$, as well as between $\mathcal{B}(B \to K E_{\mathrm{miss}})$ and $P^{\Lambda}_{L}$, in eight distinct new physics scenarios. We find that the $P^{\Lambda}_{L}$ can be used to distinguish the chirality of the hadronic current part in the effective operators, which is similar to the cases in the two-body decays $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda \phi$ and $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda V$.</description>

      <title>Space-time geometry of small and large collision systems at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identified-hadron (PID) spectra from 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb and $p$-$p$ collisions are analyzed via a two-component (soft + hard) model (TCM) of hadron production in high-energy nuclear collisions. The Pb-Pb TCM is adopted with minor changes from a recent analysis of PID hadron spectra from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions. The object of study is evidence for jet suppression in small and large collision systems as indicating quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation there. Conventional methods have included Pb-Pb centrality determination via classical Glauber model and evidence for high-$p_t$ suppression sought via spectrum ratio $R_\text{AA}$. In the present study alternative geometry determination via ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ data reveals that the number of participant nucleons in central Pb-Pb collisions is about 1/3 of the Glauber estimate. Based on certain features of Pb-Pb spectra the validity of the factorization assumption is also questioned. The entire jet contribution is therefore treated without factorization in ratio to a $p$-$p$ spectrum model as reference. The new results indicate that exclusivity and time dilation (experienced by participant partons) play an essential role in jet production not incorporated in Glauber model or hard-component factorization. The combination determines an effective number of N-N collisions per participant nucleon given specific Pb-Pb centrality. The effect on parton fragment (jet) distributions on $p_t$ is similar to projectile-proton fragment distributions on pseudorapidity from fixed-target $p$-A experiments where low-$\eta$ densities scale with A while high-$\eta$ densities are consistent with $p$-$p$ collisions. $p$-Pb and Pb-Pb spectra similarly analyzed reflect the same physics given different geometries. Jet suppression related to QGP formation is not evident.</description>

      <title>Higher-spin light-flavor baryonic spectroscopy in AdS/QCD at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-flavor baryon resonances in the $J^P=3/2^+$, $J^P=5/2^+$, and $J^P=5/2^-$ families are investigated in a soft-wall AdS/QCD model at finite temperature, including the zero temperature limit. Regge-like trajectories relating the configurational entropy underlying these resonances to both the radial quantum number and the baryon mass spectra are constructed, allowing for the extrapolation of the higher-spin light-flavor baryonic mass spectra to higher values of the radial quantum number. The configurational entropy is shown to increase drastically with temperature, in the range beyond T ~ 38 MeV. The mass spectra of baryon families are analyzed, supporting a phase transition nearly above the Hagedorn</description>

      <title>Comment on "Unruh effect for neutrinos interacting with accelerated matter"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present comment, we show that the fundamental equation worked by Dvornikov in his paper, which is the Dirac equation for a massive neutrino interacting with linearly accelerated matter, is incorrect. In particular, Dvornikov incorrectly wrote/defined the effective external current in a curved space-time. In other words, Dvornikov wrote/defined such an effective current in a flat space-time, which is a mistake. Consequently, the second-order differential equation (generated through the quadratic Dirac equation) in your paper is incorrect, where such an equation is given by the Whittaker equation. So, since the solutions of such a differential equation (whose solutions are the Whittaker functions) are the basis for its results, it implies that such results are also incorrect. In this way, starting from the true/correct Dirac equation with an effective external current in a curved space-time, we obtain in detail the second-order differential equation (also a Whittaker equation) and its solutions for a neutrino interacting with linearly accelerated matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dissociative associated production of a J/$\psi$ meson and a dimuon via double parton scattering (DPS) in nucleus--proton ultraperipheral collisions. This new channel, characterized by a rapidity gap, is sensitive to the photon and gluon distributions of the proton. We derive a DPS pocket formula for this process, together with a corresponding expression for the effective cross section. Furthermore, we demonstrate the kinematic dependence of the effective cross section and present predictions for the differential DPS cross section at LHC and FCC energies.</description>

      <title>Study of the two-body nonleptonic $B_{c}(2S)$ weak decays with the QCD factorization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the promising prospect of the $B_{c}(2S)$ meson at the coming HL-LHC experiments, the nonleptonic $B_{c}(2S)$ meson weak decays induced by both the $b$ and $c$ decays are investigated with the QCD factorization approach. It is found that branching ratios for the color- and CKM-favored $B_{c}(2S)$ ${\to}$ $B_{s}{\rho}$, $B_{s}{\pi}$ decays can reach up to ${\cal O}(10^{-9})$, which might be measurable. The $B_{c}(2S)$ decays into the final states containing one charmonium are highly suppressed by the CKM factors, and have significantly small branching ratios, ${\cal O}(10^{-12})$ and less, which might be outside the future measurement capability. This paper provides a ready reference for the future experimental study on the hadronic $B_{c}(2S)$ weak decays.</description>

      <title>Probing a long-lived pseudoscalar in type-I 2HDM with displaced vertices and jets at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model, the pseudoscalar $A$ can act as a long-lived particle (LLP) for sufficiently large values of $\tan\beta$. At the LHC, the $A$ particles are predominantly produced in pairs through $pp \to W^*/Z^* \to H^\pm/H \, A$, with subsequent decays $H^{\pm}/H \to W^\pm/Z\, A$. The pseudoscalar $A$ typically decays into a pair of bottom quarks after traveling a macroscopic distance from its production point, giving rise to displaced-vertex (DV) signatures inside the inner detector. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of signal events with DVs plus jets, and assess the discovery prospects of $A$ as an LLP at the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Our findings show that a substantial portion of the parameter space with $m_A&gt;10$ GeV has already been excluded by LHC Run-2 data, while the high-luminosity LHC will be able to probe broader regions.</description>

      <title>Tensor-current contributions to B Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor-current operators, potentially generated by scalar leptoquarks in grand unified theories (GUTs), are among the plausible new physics (NP) candidates suggested by the anomalies observed in $B$-meson decays. As experimental data continue to accumulate, exploring this possibility remains timely and well motivated. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of representative tensor-current Wilson coefficients ($C_T, C_{T5}$) in $b \to s \ell^+ \ell^-$ transitions. By incorporating contributions from the high-$q^2$ region, our framework fully exploits the available experimental data across the entire $q^2$ range. Within this setup, five distinct lepton-flavor-universal (LFU) scenarios are proposed and tested through global fits. Our results show that it is difficult to resolve the tension between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions using only $C_T$ and $C_{T5}$. Meanwhile, the significance of $\Delta C_9$ remains essentially unchanged, even in the presence of tensor contributions. In one representative scenario (S-III), we obtain $[C_9,C_{10}, C_T, C_{T5}] \simeq [-1.05,\,0.22,\,0.02,\,0.01]$, with a reduced chi-squared statistic $\tilde{\chi}^2 \equiv \chi^2_{\rm min}/{\rm d.o.f.} = 708.7/486 = 1.46$. Furthermore, we derive a stringent 95$\%$ C.L. constraint on tensor operators, $$
  F(x,y)\Big|^{\text{S-I}}_{x=\Delta C_T,\,y=\Delta C_{T5}}
  = x^2 + 0.063\,xy + 0.989\,y^2 + 0.034\,x + 0.043\,y \leq 0.003, $$ which provides one of the strongest bounds to date on $C_T$ and $C_{T5}$.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic probes as signatures for a first-order QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dimuon production in the context of a first-order phase transition in QCD matter using a chiral fluid dynamics model. This approach incorporates non-equilibrium effects such as entropy production and reheating, which emerge during the dynamical evolution through a first-order phase transition. By comparing equilibrium and non-equilibrium scenarios across a range of beam energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.2-6.2$~GeV), we analyze the resulting invariant mass spectra. Our results reveal a substantial enhancement of dilepton yields in the non-equilibrium scenario, particularly pronounced at lower beam energies, where reheating leads to a prolonged lifetime of the fireball and increased emission. The enhancement persists even after normalizing to pion multiplicities, indicating sensitivity beyond effects of entropy production.</description>

      <title>NLP threshold corrections to W+jet production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed computation of the helicity-dependent next-to-leading power leading logarithms in W+jet production, originating from next-to-soft gluon radiation and soft (anti-)quark emissions. These contributions are systematically captured via helicity-sensitive spinor shifts and soft quark operators. The resulting expressions exhibit full agreement with a recently proposed universal structure of NLP corrections for processes involving the production of an arbitrary massive colourless final state in association with a jet.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Sub-GeV Dark Matter with Strong MeV Gamma-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) with $s$-channel resonant self-scattering provides a promising framework for addressing small-scale structure problems. However, models that also account for the observed relic abundance through the same resonance are strongly constrained by current $\gamma$-ray observations, since the associated signals are significantly enhanced. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework in which the relic abundance and self-scattering are governed independently by two distinct mediators. As a concrete realization, we present a singlet scalar DM model in which self-scattering is mediated by a vector boson associated with a gauged baryon number, while the relic density is determined by forbidden annihilation into dark Higgs bosons that generate the gauge boson mass. By imposing cosmological, experimental, and theoretical constraints, We identify viable parameter regions that reproduce the observed relic density, alleviate small-scale problems, and remain consistent with current bounds. Notably, the model predicts multiple distinctive MeV $\gamma$-ray signals, a significant fraction of which will be testable with next-generation MeV $\gamma$-ray telescopes, including the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI).</description>

      <title>How large are hadronic contributions to $h \to \gamma \gamma$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of the Higgs boson into two photons, $h \to \gamma \gamma$, is a loop-induced process within the Standard Model, predominantly mediated by loops of $W$ bosons and top quarks. While these leading contributions are well understood, the role of hadronic effects, which arise from non-perturbative QCD dynamics, has received less attention, with recent studies reporting puzzling and contradictory results. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of the hadronic contributions to the $h \to \gamma \gamma$ decay width using dispersion relations. Our analysis shows that these contributions are exceedingly small, as expected, altering the decay width by at most about $0.004\%$ under conservative assumptions. Therefore, hadronic effects can be safely neglected even in the context of future high-precision Higgs measurements at current and next-generation colliders.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Warm Dark Matter in Gauge Extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the left-right symmetric extension of the Standard Model (LRSM), featuring a TeV-scale right-handed (RH) gauge boson $W_R$ and three RH neutrinos. This setup naturally realises the type-II seesaw mechanism for active neutrino masses. We identify the conditions that yield sufficient entropy dilution to reconcile the keV sterile neutrino dark matter energy density with observations while inducing an early matter domination (EMD) phase. These constrain the lightest active neutrino mass to 8.59 x 10^{-10} eV &lt; m_{\nu_1} &lt; 5.06 x 10^{-9} eV$. The resulting frequency-dependent suppression of the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background is set by the mass and lifetime of the heavier RH neutrinos. Computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for future detectors, we find that a blue-tilted primordial tensor spectrum can boost the GW signal to detectable levels (SNR &gt; 10) in experiments such as LISA, BBO, and DECIGO.</description>

Abstract: We review the series of specific nCTEQ analyses of nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs) published since 2020 and present preliminary results of a new global analysis. Building on a modern proton baseline without nuclear data and extending the kinematic range, it combines and updates the previous separate analyses that focused on Jefferson Lab neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), neutrino DIS and dimuon production, and the currently available CERN LHC data, in particular on W/Z-boson, single inclusive hadron, and heavy-quark production.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Changing Non-Global Logarithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-global logarithms are low energy correlations between the substructure of a jet and the event in which it is immersed. We study the leading non-global logarithms that arise from soft quark--anti-quark emission and calculate their coefficient as a series in the jet radius, $R$, in arbitrary processes. We calculate the exact coefficient through quadratic order in $R$, and show that this truncation is within $5\%$ of the complete result for radii up to $R = 1$. These quark flavor-dependent non-global logarithms are also responsible for the infrared unsafety of a na\"ive definition of jet flavor that is simply the net sum of quark flavors in the jet of interest. We propose a small modification of this na\"ive jet flavor that we call subtractive jet flavor in which the problematic soft logarithms are explicitly subtracted. We further demonstrate how our analytic results can be interfaced with automated numerical fixed-order codes to extract subtractive jet flavor cross sections.</description>

      <title>Primordial Tangyuan Quark Stars Made of Longevous False Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High quark chemical potential can induce a potential barrier and suppress the nucleation in a dynamical first-order chiral phase transition. Quark matter in the early Universe can therefore remain as metastable false vacuum and constitute primordial compact objects. We have investigated the properties and possible destinies of two distinct branches of primordial compact objects, quark stars with a true vacuum core and a false vacuum crust named tangyuan stars, and quark nuggets with a global false vacuum. These unique tangyuan stars and nuggets may explain observed compact stars with small masses and radii. Temperature determines the destiny of the false vacuum. Initially hot tangyuan stars and nuggets will spontaneously undergo a surface first-order phase transition, which could produce observable signals. The vacuum energy can span the energy range of typical $\gamma-$ray bursts and has the potential to drive extremely energetic long $\gamma-$ray bursts. Meanwhile, the gravitational waves with characteristic frequency $f\sim$ kHz fall within the sensitivity range of future ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Axion-Photon Coupling from Chandrayaan-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have gained immense attention in searches for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics. Experiments searching for axions leverage their predicted couplings to Standard Model (SM) particles to look for observable signals. Though weak, these couplings allow axions to be produced abundantly in the interiors of stars such as the Sun. Once created, axions can escape the Sun and while passing through the solar atmosphere, oscillate into photons in the magnetic field producing x-rays. For the first time, we used data from the observation of soft x-rays from the quiet Sun during the 2019-20 solar minimum by the solar x-ray monitor (XSM), onboard India's Chandrayaan-2 lunar exploration mission, to constrain the coupling of axions to photons ($g_{a \gamma \gamma}$). Using the latest models of the solar atmosphere to calculate the magnetic field and plasma frequency, we constrain $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim (0.47\,-\,2.2) \times 10^{-10}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at 95% confidence level for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-4}$eV.</description>

      <title>Helicity correlation of dihadron in current and target fragmentation regions of unpolarized SIDIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the helicity correlation of two $\Lambda$ hyperons produced in unpolarized semi-inclusive deep inelastic scatterings (SIDIS), with one hyperon detected in the current fragmentation region and the other in the target fragmentation region. This observable provides direct access to the spin-dependent fragmentation function $G_{1Lq}$ and the spin-dependent fracture function $l_{1q}^L$ even in unpolarized lepton nucleon collisions. Utilizing the perturbative matching of the fracture function, we present numerical predictions for the helicity correlation, revealing significant variations with flavor and kinematic regions. This observable offers a unique way to investigate the spin-dependent hadronization mechanism across both the current and target fragmentation regions. It also provides new insights into the spin transfer effects in SIDIS processes.</description>

      <title>A possibility of describing a sequential gauge symmetry as a part of the dihedral flavor symmetry and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method in which the dimension-five and -six terms in a sequential gauge symmetry can coexist with that of the dihedral flavor symmetry. We start with the contents in the model proposed in a sequential gauge symmetry, meeting the conditions for the contents to be described in the flavor symmetry, build up the mass matrices and discuss its implications. Given that the breaking of the symmetry only takes place in the dimension-five and -six terms in the mass matrix of the charged fermion sectors, via the flavor-specific Higgs scalars, we address how adding the non-sequential contents as a part of the model can be realized and why adding such is needed. In doing so, we illustrate that the terms in the sequential gauge could be understood as the higher-order terms, the correction terms, and that in the non-sequential flavor symmetry as that of the leading order. We present that the mediation between the sequential and the non-sequential term within each sector is needed to take the hierarchical scheme of the charged and the neutral lepton sectors into account. Our result could be understood as an illustration of introducing the sequential gauge as a cause for the mixing and that of the coexistence of the sequential and the non-sequential gauge terms, and can be applied to other flavor model. Seeing the non-sequential term leading us to the mass matrix and the sequential term cross-contaminating between sectors could be an indication of the size of the mass being independent from that of the mixing in the leading order and a reason for the size of the mixing in the lepton sector being larger than that of the quark sector.</description>

      <title>Witten Effect in $3$-Form Description of $\theta$-vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\theta$-vacua of a gauge theory admit an equivalent formulation as vacua of a massless Chern-Simons $3$-form, which originate from the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. This formulation provides a framework in which the physical manifestations of the $\theta$-angle, which are quantum in origin, can be captured at the level of effective classical equations of motion. Within this framework, we derive the Witten effect, demonstrating that in the background of a massless $3$-form, the magnetic monopole indeed acquires an electric charge proportional to $\theta$. This result, in particular, provides evidence that instantons, even when constrained by the Higgs effect, maintain a non-zero topological susceptibility of the vacuum. In addition to the Witten effect, we numerically demonstrate that a magnetic monopole exhibits polarizability when placed in a constant background electric field.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5_aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) QCD processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments providing further optimizations of CUDACPP for GPUs, which I consider ready for inclusion in a new release of the software. The new approach mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which has been so far performed using a single large GPU kernel, into several smaller kernels. I also take this opportunity to describe more in detail some features of the CUDACPP software that are relevant to these new developments and that have not yet been documented.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Demagnifying gravitational lenses as probes of dark matter structures and nonminimal couplings to gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnification of total image fluxes is typically considered a defining feature of gravitational microlensing. In contrast, I will show that nonminimal couplings to gravity can generate regions of negative gravitational potential curvature, giving rise to the distinctive possibility of demagnification. Such events, appearing as flux troughs in microlensing light curves, provide a direct probe of dark matter structures and, crucially, offer a means to disentangle nonminimal couplings to gravity from other astrophysical and cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Radiative-Corrected Higgs Inflation in Light of the Latest ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r &lt; 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} &lt; \lambda/\xi^{2} &lt; 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gravitational Waves from Modulated Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate scalar-induced stochastic gravitational waves from adiabatic curvature perturbations sourced by a spectator field via the modulated reheating mechanism. We consider a spectator scalar with Higgs-like couplings and inflaton decay via shift symmetric dimension-five operators. The spectator is assumed to be in the Sitter vacuum and it sources blue-tilted, strongly non-Gaussian curvature perturbations which can dominate the spectrum on small scales $k \gg \rm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the setup could generate a gravitational wave signal testable by surveys like BBO and DECIGO but only for large coupling values not expected in low-energy particle physics setups that can be perturbatively extrapolated up to the inflationary scale.</description>

      <title>Axionless strong CP problem solution: the spontaneous CP violation case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an alternative to the axion mechanism for addressing the charge parity (CP) problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our approach involves imposing CP as an inherent symmetry of the Lagrangian, which is then spontaneously broken. To generate the correct texture for the Yukawa matrices, we introduce a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that is softly broken by the scalar potential. By identifying a benchmark point for the Yukawa couplings that aligns with the measured quark masses, the CKM matrix, and low-energy flavor-changing constraints, our findings suggest that this model offers a viable solution to the CP problem.</description>

      <title>Binwise exploration of vector couplings in $B_s \to D_s^{(*)} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent results from the LHCb experiment have confirmed that lepton flavor universality is upheld in flavor-changing neutral current processes, such as $B \to K^{(*)} l^+ l^-$. However, discrepancies remain in the charged current sector, raising questions about the universality of lepton flavors in these processes. To explore this issue, we investigate the decays $B_s \to D_s^{(*)} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ in different $q^2$ bins, which involve the $b \to c \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ transition. We employ a model-independent approach to analyze potential new physics by fitting both real and complex (axial)vector coefficients to the existing $b \to (u, c) \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ data. Our analysis enables us to calculate the branching ratios and angular distributions for the $B_s \to D_s^{(*)} \tau \bar \nu_\tau$ decays in four different $q^2$ bins. Additionally, we evaluate whether lepton flavor universality is maintained in these charged current decays or if deviations suggest the presence of new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a model of quark and lepton compositeness based on an $SU(15)$ gauge interaction that confines chiral preons, which are also charged under the weakly-coupled $SU(4)_{\rm PS} \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ gauge group. The breaking of the latter, down to the Standard Model group, is achieved by scalar $SU(15)$ bound states at a scale in the $30 - 100$ TeV range. The embedding of the QCD gauge group in $SU(4)_{\rm PS} $ slows down the running of $\alpha_s$ in the UV. We estimate the effects of the strongly-coupled $SU(15)$ dynamics on the running of the $SU(4)_{\rm PS} \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ gauge couplings, which likely remain perturbative beyond the compositeness scale of about $10^3 - 10^4$ TeV, and even above a unification scale. A composite vectorlike lepton doublet acquires a mass in the TeV range probed at future colliders, and an extended Higgs sector arises from 6-preon bound states.</description>

      <title>Could We Observe an Exploding Black Hole in the Near Future?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observation of an exploding black hole would provide the first direct evidence of primordial black holes, the first direct evidence of Hawking radiation, and definitive information on the particles present in nature. However, indirect constraints suggest that direct observation of an exploding Schwarzschild black hole is implausible. We introduce a dark-QED toy model consisting of a dark photon and a heavy dark electron. In this scenario a population of light primordial black holes charged under the dark $u(1)$ symmetry can become quasi-extremal, so they survive much longer than if they were uncharged, before discharging and exhibiting a Schwarzschild-like final explosion. We show that the answer is "yes", in this scenario the probability of observing an exploding black hole over the next $10$ years could potentially be over $90\%$.</description>

      <title>Probing Earth's core using atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the presence of NSI at INO-ICAL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos can serve as a complementary and independent tool to gravitational and seismic studies in exploring the interior of Earth, thanks to their unique properties: extremely low interaction cross sections and flavor oscillations. With the precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters and observation of the non-zero value of mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, it has become feasible to detect the forward scattering of GeV-energy atmospheric neutrinos passing through Earth with ambient electrons in the form of matter effects on neutrino oscillation probabilities. These matter effects depend on both the neutrino energy and electron density distribution along their path, making them ideally suited for exploring the inner structure of Earth. Furthermore, in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSI) of neutrinos with matter, oscillation patterns undergo additional modifications. In this study, we quantify the capability of an atmospheric neutrino experiment, such as a magnetized iron calorimeter detector, to validate the Earth's core and measure the position of the core-mantle boundary in the presence of NSI. We perform this study considering a three-layered density profile of Earth. Our analysis demonstrates that neutrino non-standard interactions impact these Earth tomography measurements in comparison to standard interactions.</description>

      <title>Energy Correlators in Semi-Inclusive Electron-Positron Annihilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01652v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate energy correlators in semi-inclusive electron-positron annihilation as precision probes of parton hadronization dynamics. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns between the examined hadron and the rest of QCD radiations in both large-angle and small-angle limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with Transverse-Momentum-Dependent Fragmentation Functions (TMD FFs) and Fragmentation Energy Correlators (FECs). The two complementary regimes encode the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement, enabling a unified description of hadron formation across all kinematic regimes. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint N3LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for energy correlations both in the sudakov and jet fragmentation region (JFR). Our results demonstrate that semi-inclusive ECs provide direct, theoretically controlled access to QCD dynamics underlying hadronization, opening new avenues for precision studies at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violating decays of Higgs boson in the NB-LSSM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation (LFV) represents a clear new physics (NP) signal beyond the standard model (SM). NB-LSSM, the next to minimal supersymmetric extension of the SM with local B-L gauge symmetry, includes three Higgs singlets and three generations of right-handed neutrinos in the basis of MSSM, motivated by the new definition of SM-like Higgs resultly from the introducing of three Higgs singlets which mix with the two Higgs doublets at the tree level in the NB-LSSM. We calculate LFV processes $h\rightarrow l_i l_j$ in the mass eigenstate basis and the electroweak interaction basis separately, and the latter adopts the mass insertion approximation (MIA) method. In the suitable parameter space, we obtain the reasonable numerical results. At the same time, the corresponding constraints from the LFV rare decays $l_j\rightarrow l_i\gamma$ are considered to analyze the numerical results.</description>

      <title>On the (Im)possibility of Electrically Charged Planck Relics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I revisit whether black-hole remnants, from sub-Planckian compact objects to Planck relics and up to (super)massive black holes, can preserve Standard-Model (SM) electric charge. Two exterior-field mechanisms -- Coulomb-focused capture from ambient media and QED Schwinger pair production -- robustly neutralize such objects across cosmic history. I first derive the general capture rate including both Coulomb and gravitational focusing, and sum the stepwise discharge time in closed form via the trigamma function, exhibiting transparent Coulomb- and gravity-dominated limits. I then integrate the Schwinger rate over the near-horizon region to obtain an explicit $\dot Q(Q)$ law: discharge proceeds until the horizon field falls below $E_{\rm crit}$, leaving a residual charge $Q_{\rm stop}^{(e)}\!\propto\! r_h^2$ that is $\ll e$ for Planck radii. Mapping the mass dependence from sub-Planckian to astrophysical scales, I also analyze dark-sector charges with heavy carriers (including kinetic mixing and massive mediators). In a conservative ``no-Schwinger'' limit where vacuum pair creation is absent, cumulative ambient exposures alone force discharge of any integer SM charge. Three possible loopholes remain. (i) A fine-tuned SM corner in which the relic sits arbitrarily close to Reissner-Nordstr\"om extremality so greybody factors suppress charged absorption, while Schwinger pair creation is absent due to Planck-scale physics. (ii) Charge relocated to a hidden $U(1)_D$ with no light opposite carriers, e.g. if the lightest state is very heavy and/or kinetic mixing with $U(1)_{\rm EM}$ is vanishingly small. (iii) Discrete or topological charges rather than ordinary SM electric charge. Outside these cases, the conclusion is robust: within SM electromagnetism, charged black-hole relics neutralize efficiently and cannot retain charge over cosmological times.</description>

      <title>The N$^3$LO Twist-2 Matching of TMD Quark Transversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) calculation of the twist-2 matching coefficients for transverse momentum dependent (TMD) quark transversity parton distribution and fragmentation functions in QCD. This matching relates the TMD quark transversity functions to their collinear counterparts in the large-transverse-momentum regime, and provides essential ingredients for precision TMD phenomenology involving transversely polarized beams. As part of our analysis, we also compute the complete set of next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) DGLAP splitting functions governing the QCD evolution of collinear transversity distributions. These results extend the perturbative toolkit for spin-dependent observables and establish the transversity sector on the same theoretical footing as unpolarized and helicity distributions. Our findings enable high-precision extractions of transversity PDFs and facilitate improved theoretical predictions for azimuthal asymmetries in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), especially in light of forthcoming data from the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the partonic origin of the proton longitudinal spin using spin-dependent energy correlator measured in lepton-hadron collisions with longitudinally polarized proton beams. These observables encode angular correlations in energy flow and are sensitive to the spin-momentum structure of confined partons. Using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we analyze the correlation patterns in both nearly back-to-back and forward limits, which establishes a direct correspondence with longitudinally polarized transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) and nucleon energy correlators (NECs). The TMDs and NECs allow consistent matching onto hard radiation region, and provide a comprehensive description of the transition from perturbative parton branching to nonperturbative confinement. Using renormalization group evolution, we obtain joint $\text{N}^{3}$LL/NNLL quantitative predictions for spin-dependent energy correlation patterns in the current and target fragmentation regions (CFR and TFR). The framework provides new theoretical insight into how the internal motion and spin of partons contribute to the formation of the proton longitudinal spin, and offers an experimental paradigm for probing the interplay between color confinement and spin dynamics at forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

Abstract: We consider the economical 331 model, based on $\beta=-1/\sqrt{3}$, with three $SU(3)$ triplets with a softly broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting scalar potential is commonly used in phenomenology. We systematically determine all the potential minima and obtain the conditions under which the electroweak vacuum is global with the help of orbit space methods. For the case the electroweak vacuum is not global, we calculate bounds on the scalar couplings from metastability. We find a parametrisation of the potential couplings in terms of physical quantities and use it to show the available parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A massive vector field is a highly promising candidate for dark matter in the universe. A salient property of dark matter is its negligible or null coupling to ordinary matter, with the exception of gravitational interaction. This poses a significant challenge in producing the requisite amount of dark particles through processes within the Standard Model. In this study, we examine the production of a vector field during inflation due to its direct interaction with the inflaton field through kinetic and axion-like couplings as well as the field-dependent mass. The gradient-expansion formalism, previously proposed for massless Abelian gauge fields, is extended to include the longitudinal polarization of a massive vector field. We derive a coupled system of equations of motion for a set of bilinear functions of the vector field. This enables us to address the nonlinear dynamics of inflationary vector field production, including backreaction on background evolution. To illustrate this point, we apply our general formalism to a low-mass vector field whose kinetic and mass terms are coupled to the inflaton via the Ratra-type exponential function. The present study investigates the production of its transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a benchmark inflationary model with a quadratic inflaton potential. It has been demonstrated that pure mass coupling is able to enhance only the longitudinal components. By turning on also the kinetic coupling, one can get different scenarios. As the coupling function decreases, the primary contribution to the energy density is derived from the transverse polarizations of the vector field. Conversely, for an increasing coupling function, the longitudinal component becomes increasingly significant and rapidly propels the system into the strong backreaction regime.</description>

Abstract: Changes in magnetic helicity are often discussed across a variety of fields, from condensed matter physics to early universe cosmology. It is frequently stated that the helicity change is given by the integral of the gauge field strength tensor and its dual over spacetime, $\int F \wedge F$. However, this is incorrect when magnetic monopoles once exist in the spacetime. In this paper, we show the correct formula of the helicity change in such a case for the Maxwell theory with the magnetic monopoles. We also discuss what happens when we embed the Maxwell theory with magnetic monopoles into non-Abelian gauge theories. We show that a similar formula holds for the 't Hooft--Polyakov monopole. In particular, we find the winding numbers and the zeroes of the Higgs field in the non-Abelian gauge theory play a crucial role in the helicity change. The same discussion is also applicable to the electroweak theory, and we discuss the implication of our findings to the baryon number change via the chiral anomaly in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: The main purpose behind this work has been to construct a supersymmetric extension of axionic electrodynamics, inspired by the supersymmetric Lorentz-symmetry-violating Carroll-Field-Jackiw (CFJ) scenario. Thus, in addition to the axion and the photon, our model naturally incorporates its supersymmetric partners - the axino and the photino - and allows for the interaction between them. This enriches the Axionic Electrodynamics not only from a theoretical standpoint but also for its phenomenological relevance, providing additional interactions between possible dark matter candidates.</description>

Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20\,$keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Resonant Singly Heavy Pentaquarks in the MIT Bag Model: Mass Spectra and Strong Decays</title>

Abstract: Exploring the limits of color interactions in multiquark states is an important topic. Based on the bag confinement picture of hadrons, we find that for singly heavy pentaquarks, the bag confinement radius precisely falls within the range of color interaction limits provided by lattice QCD, approximately 1.17--1.29$\,\text{fm}$. This leads us to believe that singly heavy pentaquark states have the potential to form resonant states. Inspired by singly heavy baryons, we consider the mirror pentaquarks of singly heavy baryons. Furthermore, we adopt the MIT bag model, taking into account chromomagnetic and color-electric interactions between heavy and strange quarks, to calculate the mass spectrum of singly heavy pentaquarks configured as $qqqQ\bar{q}$ and analyze the stability of their S-wave two-body strong decays. We show that for the singly heavy pentaquark system, the masses are generally about $500\, \text{MeV}$ higher than the corresponding mirror baryon ground state masses, which is consistent with conclusions drawn from chiral methods. We also provide a mass mapping relationship between singly heavy pentaquarks and singly heavy baryons based on light quark flavor symmetry. The analysis of strong decays indicates that these singly heavy pentaquarks are unstable with respect to strong decays, which is consistent with our initial hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Observation of Temperature Effects on False Vacuum Decay in Atomic Quantum Gases</title>

Abstract: Temperature plays a crucial role in metastable phenomena, not only by contributing to determine the state (phase) of a system, but also ruling the decay probability to more stable states. Such a situation is encountered in many different physical systems, ranging from chemical reactions to magnetic structures. The characteristic decay timescale is not always straightforward to estimate since it depends on the microscopic details of the system. A paradigmatic example in quantum field theories is the decay of the false vacuum, manifested via the nucleation of bubbles. In this paper, we measure the temperature dependence of the timescale for the false vacuum decay mechanism in an ultracold atomic quantum spin mixture which exhibits ferromagnetic properties. Our results show that the false vacuum decay rate scales with temperature as predicted by the finite-temperature extension of the instanton theory, and confirm atomic systems as an ideal platform where to study out-of-equilibrium field theories.</description>

      <title>Kaon-meson coupling from SU(3) flavour symmetry and application to antikaon condensed dense matter in neutron star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Observations of massive pulsars suggest that the central density of neutron stars can exceed several times the nuclear saturation density, creating a favourable environment for the appearance of exotic states, such as strange and non-strange baryons, meson condensates, and deconfined quark matter. The antikaon condensate is the most studied and plausible candidate among meson condensates. However, little is known about the exact interaction mechanisms between antikaons and mediator mesons. In this work, we investigate these interactions by, for the first time, employing SU(3) flavor symmetry to study antikaon condensation in dense matter. We determine hadron couplings in the mesonic sector using SU(3) flavour symmetry. Among the three key parameters we calculate $\theta_v$, the mixing angle between the octet meson $\omega_8$ and the singlet meson $\phi_1$; the ratio of the octet to singlet couplings $z$; and leave the weight factor that balances the symmetric and antisymmetric couplings $\alpha_v$ as a free parameter to explore its impact on the system. Using this approach, we derive the couplings for antikaon interactions with both singlet and octet mesons in the nonet vector meson family and examine the corresponding implications for dense matter featuring antikaon condensation. Our findings reveal that the equation of state for dense matter becomes progressively stiffer with increasing values of $\alpha_v$, which delays the onset of antikaon condensation and increases the maximum achievable mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Testing Quintessence Axion Dark Energy with Recent Cosmological Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quintessence axion model for dynamical dark energy, motivated in part by recent results from the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) combined with the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the latest Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) data. By carefully treating the initial conditions and parameter sampling, we identify a preferred parameter space featuring a sub-Planckian axion decay constant and a relatively large axion mass, which naturally avoids the quality problem and remains consistent with the perturbative string conjecture. Our parameter scan also uncovers a trans-Planckian regime of theoretical interest, which is only mildly disfavored even by the strongest constraint. Finally, we discuss the possible connection between this model and the recently reported non-zero rotation of the CMB linear polarization angle, emphasizing the broader cosmological implications and the promising prospects for testing this scenario. We show that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ electromagnetic anomaly coefficient is preferred by the strongest constraint, which is in full agreement with the minimal quintessence axion model.</description>

      <title>Suggestions of decreasing dark energy from supernova and BAO data: an update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous work 2305.04946, we found that supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation data support the hypothesis that late time cosmic acceleration is caused by the potential energy of a scalar field descending its potential, as suggested by holographically defined models of quantum gravity. In this note, we update our analysis using the Dark Energy Survey 5 year supernova data set (DES-SN5YR) and the baryon acoustic oscillation data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2). Approximating the scalar potential via a first order Taylor series $V \approx V_0 + V_1 \phi$ about the present value, and making use of only recent-time data from DES-SN5YR and DESI DR2, we find that the slope parameter is constrained as $V_1 = 1.49 \pm 0.25$ in a standard likelihood analysis. This is naively a $&gt;5 \sigma$ discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM (which has $V_1 =0$), though a more detailed analysis not assuming a Gaussian likelihood distribution suggests $4 \sigma$ significance. Based only on the $\Delta \chi^2 = -13.7$ improvement of fit while ignoring parameter space volumes disfavours $\Lambda$CDM at a $3 \sigma$ significance level. These significance measures are substantially improved from our previous analysis using older data sets. We also reproduce the DESI DR2 parameter constraints based on the same combination of data and find that the $\Lambda$CDM is more strongly disfavoured in the context of the linear potential extension (dubbed $V_0V_1$) as compared with the $w_0 w_a$ extension of $\Lambda$CDM. A caveat is that for both $w_0 w_a$ and $V_0 V_1$, much of the significance relies on the historical $z &lt; 0.1$ supernova samples included in the DES-SN5YR data set.</description>

      <title>Probing Reheating Phase via Non-Helical Magnetogenesis and Secondary Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in observational techniques to enhance our understanding of the universe and its evolutionary processes. However, our knowledge of the post-inflation reheating phase remains limited due to its small-scale dynamics. Traditional observations, such as those of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), primarily provide insights into large-scale dynamics, making it challenging to glean information about the reheating era. In this paper, our primary aim is to explore how the generation of Gravitational Waves (GWs) spectra, resulting from electromagnetic fields in the early universe, can offer valuable insights into the Reheating dynamics. We investigate how the spectral shape of GWs varies across different frequency ranges, depending on the initial magnetic profile and reheating dynamics. For this, we consider a well-known non-helical magnetogenesis model, where the usual electromagnetic kinetic term is coupled with a background scalar. Notably, for such a scenario, we observe distinct spectral shapes with sufficiently high amplitudes for different reheating histories with the equation of state parametrized by ($w_{\rm re}$). We identify spectral breaks in the GW spectra for both $w_{\rm re}&lt;1/3$ and $w_{\rm re}&gt;1/3$ scenarios. We find that future GW experiments such as BBO, LISA, SKA, and DECIGO are well within the reach of observing those distinct spectral shapes and can potentially shed light on the underlying mechanism of the reheating phase.</description>

      <title>Real-Time String Dynamics in a $2+1$D Non-Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory: String Breaking, Glueball Formation, Baryon Blockade, and Tension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding flux string dynamics can provide insight into quark confinement and hadronization. First-principles quantum and numerical simulations have mostly focused on toy-model Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs). With the advent of state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments, it is important to bridge this gap and study string dynamics in non-Abelian LGTs beyond one spatial dimension. Using tensor network methods, we simulate the real-time string dynamics of a $2\!+\!1$D SU$(2)$ Yang--Mills LGT with dynamical matter. In the strong-coupling regime and at resonance, string breaking occurs through sharp Casimir reduction along with meson and baryon-antibaryon formation, a distinctively non-Abelian feature. At finite baryon density, we discover a \textit{baryon blockade} mechanism that delays string breaking. Away from resonance, the magnetic term drives purely non-Abelian fluctuations: glueball loops and self-crossed strings that resolve two SU$(2)$ intertwiners with distinct dynamics. For higher-energy strings, we uncover representation-dependent tension-reduction resonances. Our findings serve as a guide for upcoming quantum simulators of non-Abelian LGTs.</description>
