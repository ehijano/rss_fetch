      <title>Exploring Correlation Patterns in the Ethereum Validator Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been several studies into measuring the level of decentralization in Ethereum through applying various indices to indicate the relative dominance of entities in different domains in the ecosystem. However, these indices do not capture any correlation between those different entities, that could potentially make them the subject of external coercion, or covert collusion. We propose an index that measures the relative dominance of entities based on the application of correlation factors. We posit that this approach produces a more nuanced and accurate index of decentralization.</description>

Abstract: Given the increasing pressures exerted by climate change on small-scale agriculture, the importance of participatory modelling methodologies that can consider both the human and environmental components of these systems has become more and more evident. The current study presents a socioeconomic system dynamics model of the food and environmental systems of the predominantly Indigenous region of Tz'ol{\"o}j Ya', Guatemala. The model was built in a participatory manner with stakeholders from the region and was then coupled to an external crop growth model before being applied to the analysis of the impact of future climate change and its potential interactions with various stakeholder-proposed policies. The analysis identified several feedback loops between environmental and human components of the system that can lead to counterintuitive responses to the proposed policies. At the same time, the use of an external crop growth model allowed for a more realistic, yet still easily implementable, representation of the impacts of climate change on crop production. This analysis is the first to use a socioeconomic system dynamics model coupled with an external crop growth model to analyse food security in the context of a local socio-environmental food system.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Urban Mobility Patterns: A Data-Driven Analysis of Public Transit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The expansion of urban centers necessitates enhanced efficiency and sustainability in their transportation infrastructure and mobility systems. The big data obtainable from various transportation modes potentially offers critical insights for urban planning. This study presents analysis of detailed historical public transit data, enriched with relevant temporal and geospatial metadata, as a precursor to injecting dynamism into digital twins of mobility systems via ML/DL-based predictive modeling. A data preprocessing framework was implemented to refine the raw data for effective historical analysis and predictive modeling. This paper examines public transit data for patterns and trends -- incorporating factors such as time, geospatial elements, external influences, and operational aspects. From a technical standpoint, this research helps to assess the quality of the available transit data and identify important information for use in digital twins. Such digital twins foster educated decisions for efficient, sustainable urban mobility systems by anticipating infrastructure demand, identifying service gaps, and understanding mobility dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of urban areas intensifies the need for sustainable, efficient transportation infrastructure and mobility systems, driving initiatives to enhance infrastructure and public transport while reducing congestion and emissions. By utilizing real-world mobility data, a data-driven approach can provide crucial insights for planning and decision-making.
  This study explores the efficacy of leveraging telecoms data from cellular network signals for studying crowd movement patterns, focusing on Trondheim, Norway. It examines routing reports to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of various transportation routes and modes.
  A data preprocessing and feature engineering framework was developed to process raw routing reports for historical analysis. This enabled the examination of geospatial trends and temporal patterns, including a comparative analysis of various transportation modes, along with public transit usage. Specific routes and areas were analyzed in-depth to compare their mobility patterns with the broader city context.
  The study highlights the potential of cellular network data as a resource for shaping urban transportation and mobility systems. By identifying deficiencies and potential improvements, city planners and stakeholders can foster more sustainable and effective transportation solutions.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics of Consumer Response: A Unified Framework Integrating Statistical Physics and Marketing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comprehending how consumers react to advertising inputs is essential for marketers aiming to optimize advertising strategies and improve campaign effectiveness. This study examines the complex nature of consumer behaviour by applying theoretical frameworks derived from physics and social psychology. We present an innovative equation that captures the relation between spending on advertising and consumer response, using concepts such as symmetries, scaling laws, and phase transitions. By validating our equation against well-known models such as the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, we prove its effectiveness in accurately representing the complexity of consumer response dynamics. The analysis emphasizes the importance of key model parameters, such as marketing effectiveness, response sensitivity, and behavioural sensitivity, in influencing consumer behaviour. The work explores the practical implications for advertisers and marketers, as well as discussing the limitations and future research directions. In summary, this study provides a thorough framework for comprehending and forecasting consumer reactions to advertising, which has implications for optimizing advertising strategies and allocating resources.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this paper, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation in the presence of noise in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average, and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the players' behavior in the thermodynamic limit, and we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighboring players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this paper demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of the one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>

      <title>Urban Scaling Laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how size influences the internal characteristics of a system is a crucial concern across various fields. Concepts like scale invariance, universalities, and fractals are fundamental to this inquiry and find application in biology, physics, and particularly urbanism. Size profoundly impacts how cities develop and function economically and socially. For example, what are the pros and cons of residing in larger cities? Is life really more expensive or less safe in larger cities? Or do they really offer more opportunities and generally higher incomes than smaller ones? To address such inquiries, we utilize theoretical tools from scaling theory, enabling a quantitative description of how a system's behavior changes across different scales, from micro to macro. Drawing parallels with research in biology and spatial economics, this chapter explores recent discoveries, ongoing progress, and unanswered questions regarding urban scaling.</description>

      <title>Social clustering reinforces external influence on the majority opinion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public opinion is subject to peer interaction via social networks and external pressures from the media, advertising, and other actors. In this paper, we study the interaction between external and peer influence on the stochastic opinion dynamics of a majority vote model. We introduce a model where agents update their opinions based on the combined influence from their local neighbourhood (peers) and from an external actor in the transition rates. In the first model, the external influence is only felt by agents non-aligned with the external actor ('push strategy'). In the second model, agents are affected by external influence, independently of their opinions ('nudging strategy'). In both cases, the external influence increases the possible macroscopic outcomes. These outcomes are determined by the chosen strategy. We also find that the social network structure affects the opinion dynamics, with high social clustering positively reinforcing the external influence while degree heterogeneity weakens it. These findings are relevant to businesses and policy making, helping to understand how groups of individuals collectively react to external actors.</description>

      <title>Mixing Individual and Collective Behaviours to Predict Out-of-Routine Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting human displacements is crucial for addressing various societal challenges, including urban design, traffic congestion, epidemic management, and migration dynamics. While predictive models like deep learning and Markov models offer insights into individual mobility, they often struggle with out-of-routine behaviours. Our study introduces an approach that dynamically integrates individual and collective mobility behaviours, leveraging collective intelligence to enhance prediction accuracy. Evaluating the model on millions of privacy-preserving trajectories across three US cities, we demonstrate its superior performance in predicting out-of-routine mobility, surpassing even advanced deep learning methods. Spatial analysis highlights the model's effectiveness near urban areas with a high density of points of interest, where collective behaviours strongly influence mobility. During disruptive events like the COVID-19 pandemic, our model retains predictive capabilities, unlike individual-based models. By bridging the gap between individual and collective behaviours, our approach offers transparent and accurate predictions, crucial for addressing contemporary mobility challenges.</description>

      <title>Stochastic COVID-19 Model Influenced by Non-Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural fluctuations have played a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of pervasive diseases such as the coronavirus. Examining the effects of irregular unsettling disturbances on epidemic models is important for understanding these dynamics. In this study, we introduce a mathematical model for the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) dynamics of the coronavirus, incorporating perturbations in the contact rate through Levy noise. The utilization of the Levy process is essential for the protection and control of diseases. We delve into the dynamics of both the deterministic model and the global positive solution of the stochastic model, establishing their existence and uniqueness. Additionally, we explore conditions for the termination and persistence of the infection. Furthermore, we derive the basic reproduction number, a critical determinant of disease extinction or persistence. Numerical results indicate that COVID-19 dissipates from the population when the reproduction number is less than one in the presence of significant or minor noise. Conversely, controlling epidemic diseases becomes challenging when the reproduction number exceeds one. To illustrate this phenomenon, we provide numerical simulations, offering insights into the dynamics of the disease and the efficacy of control measures</description>

      <title>Non-coresident family as a driver of migration change in a crisis: The case of the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changes in U.S. migration during the COVID-19 pandemic show that many moved to less populated cities from larger cities, deviating from previous trends. In this study, building on prior work in the literature showing that the abundance of family ties is inversely related to population size, we analyze these migration changes with a focus on the crucial, yet overlooked factor of extended family. Employing two large-scale data sets, census microdata and mobile phone GPS relocation data, we show a collection of empirical results that paints a picture of migration change affected by kin. Namely, we find that people migrated closer to family at higher rates after the COVID-19 pandemic started. Moreover, even controlling for factors such as population density and cost of living, we find that changes in net in-migration tended to be larger and positive in cities with larger proportions of people who can be parents to adult children (our proxy for parental family availability, which is also inversely related to population size). Our study advances the demography-disaster nexus and amplifies ongoing literature highlighting the role of broader kinship systems in large-scale socioeconomic phenomena.</description>
