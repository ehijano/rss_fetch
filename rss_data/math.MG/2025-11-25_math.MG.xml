      <title>Open problems on Steiner trees and maximal distance minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I collect and discuss a series of open questions in one-dimensional geometric optimization in Euclidean spaces. The focus is on two classes of problems: maximal distance minimizers and Steiner trees. Maximal distance minimizers concern finding a connected set of minimal length whose closed $r$-neighborhood covers a given compact set, whereas Steiner trees aim to find a minimal-length set connecting a prescribed set of points. For both problems, I briefly summarize known results and highlight the remaining open questions. While some questions can be approached with elementary methods, others remain highly challenging.</description>

      <title>Currents in Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are three approaches to currents tuned to the anisotropic geometry of Heisenberg groups: Ambrosio and Kirchheim's approach valid for general metric spaces; distributions dual to horizontal differential forms; distributions dual to Rumin's complex. It is shown that, in dimensions less than half the ambient dimension, these three theories coincide. On the other hand, they diverge beyond middle dimension: Ambrosio-Kirchheim currents vanish, Rumin currents correspond to a new class of Federer-Fleming currents called oblique currents.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetric nets: a constructive approach to the equimodular elliptic type of Kokotsakis polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates flexible Kokotsakis polyhedra with a quadrangular base of equimodular elliptic type, filling a significant gap in the literature by providing the first explicit constructions of this type together with an explicit algebraic characterization in terms of flat and dihedral angles. A straightforwardly constructible class of polyhedra - called quasi-symmetric nets (QS-nets) - is introduced, characterized by a symmetry relation among flat angles. It is shown that every elliptic QS-net has equimodular elliptic type and is flexible in real three-dimensional Euclidean space (rather than only in complex configuration spaces), except for a few exceptional choices of dihedral angles, and that its flexion admits a closed-form parameterization. Examples are constructed that are non-self-intersecting and belong exclusively to the equimodular elliptic type. To support applications in computational geometry, a numerical pipeline is developed that searches for candidate solutions, verifies them using the explicit algebraic characterization, and constructs and visualizes the resulting polyhedra; numerical validations achieve high precision. Taken together, these results provide constructive criteria, algorithms, and validated examples for the equimodular elliptic type, enabling the design of a broad range of flexible Kokotsakis mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Timed Hausdorff Convergence and Its Implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sakovich--Sormani introduced several notions of distance between certain classes of Lorentzian manifolds. These distances use the Hausdorff and Gromov--Hausdorff distances and therefore extend naturally to a broader class of spaces. Here we show that, for timed metric spaces, intrinsic timed--Hausdorff convergence implies (timeless) Gromov--Hausdorff convergence as well as big bang convergence, among other related implications.</description>

      <title>Circle Squaring with Pieces of Small Boundary and Low Borel Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01412v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tarski's Circle Squaring Problem from 1925 asks whether it is possible to partition a disk in the plane into finitely many pieces and reassemble them via isometries to yield a partition of a square of the same area. It was finally resolved by Laczkovich in 1990 in the affirmative. Recently, several new proofs have emerged which achieve circle squaring with better structured pieces: namely, pieces which are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire (Grabowski-M\'ath\'e-Pikhurko) or even are Borel (Marks-Unger).
  In this paper, we show that circle squaring is possible with Borel pieces of positive Lebesgue measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension less than 2 (in particular, each piece is Jordan measurable). We also improve the Borel complexity of the pieces: namely, we show that each piece can be taken to be a Boolean combination of $F_\sigma$ sets. This is a consequence of our more general result that applies to any two bounded subsets of $R^k$, $k\ge 1$, of equal positive measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension smaller than $k$.</description>

      <title>Sobolev sheaves on the plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that for any integer $k \in \mathbb{N}$ there exists a Sobolev sheaf (in the sense of Lebeau) on any definable site of $\mathbb{R}^2$ that agrees with Sobolev spaces on cuspidal domains. We also provide a complete computation of the cohomology of these sheaves using the notion of 'Good direction' introduced by Valette. This paper serves as an introduction to a more general project on the sheafification of Sobolev spaces in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A note on Bernoulli type free boundary problem on collapsed RCD(K,N)-spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Bernoulli type free boundary problem on collapsed RCD(K,N)-spaces. We prove the existence of minimizers and prove the local Lipschitz continuity of minimizers provided that the negative part is locally Lipschitz continuous. In particular, we prove the local Lipschitz continuity of minimizers for the one-phase problem (i.e. when the solution is non-negative). And then we prove that the free boundaries of minimizers have locally finite perimeter. We emphasize that the proof in this paper applies to collapsed RCD(K,N)-spaces and does not rely on the non-collapsed condition.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of polytopes with edge length and coplanarity constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel setting for polytope rigidity, where a flex must preserve edge lengths and the planarity of faces, but is allowed to change the shapes of faces. For instance, the regular cube is flexible in this notion. We present techniques for constructing flexible polytopes and find that flexibility seems to be an exceptional property. Based on this observation, we introduce a notion of generic realizations for polytopes and conjecture that convex polytopes are generically rigid in dimension $d\geq 3$. We prove this conjecture in dimension $d=3$. Motivated by our findings we also pose several questions that are intended to inspire future research into this notion of polytope rigidity.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>Generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>
