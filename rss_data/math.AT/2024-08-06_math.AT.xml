      <title>Iwasawa invariants of finite spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the classical Iwasawa invariants of the Iwasawa modules associated to the $p$-adic topological $K$-theory of finite spectra. We show that the graded average of the orders of $n$ consecutive $K(1)$-local homotopy groups of a finite spectrum $X$ grows asymptotically like $\frac{-\log_p(n)}{2}$ times the total Iwasawa $\lambda$-invariant of $X$. We show that the Iwasawa $\mu$-invariants of finite spectra are all zero. Finally, we prove a spectral analogue of a weak form of the Iwasawa Main Conjecture, describing the orders of the $K(1)$-local homotopy groups of a certain ``torsion-free replacement'' of $X$ in terms of the characteristic polynomials of the Iwasawa modules associated to $X$.</description>

      <title>Differential Cohomology as Diffeological Homotopy Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin homotopies, introduced by Caetano-Picken, serve to axiomatize the holonomy of connections on principal bundles. This approach has been generalized to higher non-abelian bundles with connection through transport functors and higher holonomies, at least in dimension two and partially in dimension three. In this thesis, we introduce a new variant of thin homotopy based on the definition of skeletal diffeologies introduced recently by Kihara and show that, in the abelian setting, ordinary differential cohomology can be completely recovered in terms of the homotopy theory of skeletal diffeological spaces. Specifically, to any smooth manifold and non-negative integer $k$, we associate a $k$-skeletal simplicial presheaf such that its $k$th cohomology with values in the circle group is isomorphic to the abelian group of Cheeger-Simons differential characters. Further, we relate these higher holonomies to the only other existing model in the literature, developed by Gajer based on the geometric loop group. The main motivation for us is to provide a model where the differential refinement is established by refining the underlying space, rather than the coefficient object. This has the advantage of possible generalizations to non-abelian differential cohomology.</description>

      <title>A stable homotopy invariant for Legendrians with generating families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a stable homotopy type invariant for any Legendrian submanifold in a jet bundle equipped with a linear-at-infinity generating family. We show that this spectrum lifts the generating family homology groups. When the generating family extends to a generating family for an embedded Lagrangian filling, we lift the Seidel isomorphism to the spectrum level. As applications, we establish topological constraints on Lagrangian fillings arising from generating families, algebraic constraints on whether generating families admit fillings, and lower bounds on how many fiber dimensions are needed to construct a generating family for a Legendrian.</description>

      <title>Quasi-elliptic cohomology of 4-spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-elliptic cohomology is conjectured by Sati and Schreiber as a particularly suitable approximation to equivariant 4-th Cohomotopy, which classifies the charges carried by M-branes in M-theory in a way that is analogous to the traditional idea that complex K-theory classifies the charges of D-branes in string theory. In this paper we compute quasi-elliptic cohomology of 4-spheres under the action by some finite subgroups that are the most interesting isotropy groups where the M5-branes may sit.</description>

      <title>Singular homology of roots of unity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend some basic results from the singular homology theory of topological spaces to the setting of \v{C}ech's closure spaces. We prove analogues of the excision and Mayer-Vietoris theorems and the Hurewicz theorem in dimension one. We use these results to calculate examples of singular homology groups of spaces that are not topological but are often encountered in applied topology, such as simple undirected graphs. We focus on the singular homology of roots of unity with closure structures arising from considering nearest neighbors. These examples can then serve as building blocks along with our Mayer-Vietoris and excision theorems for computing the singular homology of more complex closure spaces.</description>

      <title>Equivariant elliptic cohomology and the 2-loop groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following an outline of Rezk, we give a construction of complex-analytic $G$-equivariant elliptic cohomology for an arbitrary compact Lie group $G$ and we prove some of its fundamental properties. The construction is parametrised over the orbit category of the groupoid of principal $G$-bundles over 2-dimensional tori and generalises Grojnowski's construction of equivariant elliptic cohomology.</description>

      <title>Facets in the Vietoris--Rips complexes of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the facets of the Vietoris--Rips complex $\mathcal{VR}(Q_n; r)$ where $Q_n$ denotes the $n$-dimensional hypercube. We are particularly interested in those facets which are somehow independent of the dimension $n$. Using Hadamard matrices, we prove that the number of different dimensions of such facets is a super-polynomial function of the scale $r$, assuming that $n$ is sufficiently large. We show also that the $(2r-1)$-th dimensional homology of the complex $\mathcal{VR}(Q_n; r)$ is non-trivial when $n$ is large enough, provided that the Hadamard matrix of order $2r$ exists.</description>

      <title>Kleene Theorem for Higher-Dimensional Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03791v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Kleene theorem for higher-dimensional automata. It states that the languages they recognise are precisely the rational subsumption-closed sets of finite interval pomsets. The rational operations on these languages include a gluing composition, for which we equip pomsets with interfaces. For our proof, we introduce higher-dimensional automata with interfaces, which are modelled as presheaves over labelled precube categories, and develop tools and techniques inspired by algebraic topology, such as cylinders and (co)fibrations. Higher-dimensional automata form a general model of non-interleaving concurrency, which subsumes many other approaches. Interval orders are used as models for concurrent and distributed systems where events extend in time. Our tools and techniques may therefore yield templates for Kleene theorems in various models and applications.</description>

Abstract: We describe reduced representatives for positive Rouquier complexes. These are obtained via Morse theoretical Gaussian elimination from the corresponding standard representatives. The underlying graded object is still a direct sum of Bott-Samelson objects, but over subwords rather than subexpressions.</description>

      <title>Nonacyclic Reidemeister torsions of manifolds of odd dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an oriented closed manifold $M$ of odd dimension and a unitary representation $\rho : \pi_1(M) \ra \GL_n(\F)$, we define a Reidemeister torsion, even if the cohomology associated with $\rho$ is not acyclic. As corollaries, we introduce some topological invariants of $M$, which include the nonacyclic extensions of abelian torsions and the Alexander polynomials of links. Further, we propose a volume form of the $\SU(n)$-character varieties of $M$. Moreover, we compute the Reidemeister torsions of some representations of 3-manifolds and compare the works of Farber--Turaev.</description>
