      <title>Montage and Radio Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Montage Image Mosaic Engine, first released in 2002, has found applicability across the electromagnetic spectrum to support data processing and visualization. This broad applicability has come about through its design as an Open Source ANSI-C toolkit (and Python binary extensions), with independent components to perform each step in the creation of a mosaic and with support for all WCS extensions. This design enables easy integration into custom environments, workflows and pipelines, and is the principal reason for its long lifetime. Here we emphasize the growing use of Montage in radio astronomy (37 peer-reviewed papers since 2020), and will focus on three high-profile applications: (1) Analysis of observations made with SKA precursor experiments, such as MeerKAT and the Murchison Wide-field Array, (2) Faraday tomography of LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey data (LoTSS-DR2), which explores the structure of the local interstellar medium, and (3) Identification of fast radio bursts.</description>

      <title>Container-Based Pre-Pipeline Data Processing on HPC for XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) is the 7th Japanese X-ray observatory, whose development and operation are in collaboration with universities and research institutes in Japan, U.S., and Europe, including JAXA, NASA, and ESA. The telemetry data downlinked from the satellite are reduced to scientific products by the pre-pipeline (PPL) and pipeline (PL) software running on standard Linux virtual machines on the JAXA and NASA sides, respectively. We ported the PPL to the JAXA "TOKI-RURI" high-performance computing (HPC) system capable of completing $\simeq 160$ PPL processes within 24 hours by utilizing the container platform of Singularity and its "--bind" option. In this paper, we briefly show the data processing in XRISM and present our porting strategy of PPL to the HPC environment in detail.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at Gemini South started regular queue operations in early 2024, bringing a long-sought open-access capability to the astronomy community. This research note briefly describes an effort to provide easy-to-access reduced spectra for GHOST programs from all Gemini partner countries and encourage prompt data exploration and analysis. Since March 2024, over 4500 spectra have been reduced and made available to principal investigators (PIs). The aim is to increase demand for GHOST and expedite the publication of scientific results.</description>

      <title>The clus model in SPEX: projection and resonant scattering effects on the iron abundance and temperature profiles of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the clus model, which has been newly implemented in the X-ray spectral fitting software package SPEX. Based on the 3D radial profiles of the gas density, temperature, metal abundance, turbulent, and inflow/outflow velocities, the clus model creates spectra for a chosen projected region on the sky. Additionally, it can also take into account the resonant scattering. We show a few applications of the clus model on simulated spectra of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4636, and galaxy clusters A383, A2029, A1795, A262, and the Perseus cluster. We quantify the effect of projection, as well as resonant scattering on inferred profiles of the iron abundance and temperature, assuming the resolution similar to Chandra ACIS-S and XRISM Resolve. Our results show that, depending on the mass of the object, as well as the projected distance from its core, neither a single-temperature, double-temperature, nor the Gaussian-shaped differential emission measure models can accurately describe the input emission measure distribution of these massive objects. The largest effect of projection as well as resonant scattering is seen for projected profiles of iron abundance of NGC 4636, where we are able to reproduce the observed iron abundance drop in its inner-most few kiloparsecs. Furthermore, we find that projection effects also influence the best-fit temperature, and the magnitude of this effect varies depending on the underlying hydrodynamical profiles of individual objects. In the core, the projection effects are the largest for A1795 and NGC 4636, while in the outskirts the largest difference between 2D and 3D temperature profiles are for Perseus and A1795, regardless of the instrumental resolution. These findings might potentially have an impact on cross-calibration studies between different instruments, as well as on the precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Accurate absolute photometric calibration by fitting the system transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming the instrumental photometry of ground-based telescopes into a calibrated physical flux in a well-defined passband is a major challenge in astronomy. Along with the intrinsic instrumental difference between telescopes sharing the same filter, the effective transmission is continuously modified by the effects of the variable atmosphere of the Earth. We have developed a new approach to the absolute photometric calibration that simultaneously treats instrumental and atmospheric effects on an image-by-image basis by fitting the system transmission. This approach aims at breaking the 1% absolute photometric accuracy which limits current calibration methods for ground-based observatories. We fit the transmission, as a function of wavelength, for each image. The fit is done by comparing the instrumental fluxes of stars in the image to the synthetic photometry of the stars given their spectrum and the transmission function which have free parameters. A key element that enables this approach is the set of about 220 million low-resolution spectra measured by Gaia, which provides a large number of stellar calibrators in the image. We demonstrate the method using data from the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST). We show that the residuals between observations and synthetic photometry of the Gaia spectra in the fitted transmission have a standard deviation $&lt;$1% on an image-by-image basis, with no spatial and color dependencies. The median accuracy of the zero-point throughout the image is between 3-5 mmag, depending on the total image exposure. Furthermore we show that this method provides high stability over long temporal scales.</description>

      <title>AutoKnots: Adaptive Knot Allocation for Spline Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysical and cosmological analyses, the increasing quality and volume of astronomical data demand efficient and precise computational tools. This work introduces a novel adaptive algorithm for automatic knots (AutoKnots) allocation in spline interpolation, designed to meet user-defined precision requirements. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manually configured knot distributions with numerous parameters, the proposed technique automatically determines the optimal number and placement of knots based on interpolation error criteria. This simplifies configuration, often requiring only a single parameter. The algorithm progressively improves the interpolation by adaptively sampling the function-to-be-approximated, $f(x)$, in regions where the interpolation error exceeds the desired threshold. All function evaluations contribute directly to the final approximation, ensuring efficiency. While each resampling step involves recomputing the interpolation table, this process is highly optimized and usually computationally negligible compared to the cost of evaluating $f(x)$. We show the algorithm's efficacy through a series of precision tests on different functions. However, the study underscores the necessity for caution when dealing with certain function types, notably those featuring plateaus. To address this challenge, a heuristic enhancement is incorporated, improving accuracy in flat regions. This algorithm has been extensively used and tested over the years. NumCosmo includes a comprehensive set of unit tests that rigorously evaluate the algorithm both directly and indirectly, underscoring its robustness and reliability. As a practical application, we compute the surface mass density $\Sigma(R)$ and the average surface mass density $\overline{\Sigma}(&lt;R)$ for Navarro-Frenk-White and Hernquist halo density profiles, which provide analytical benchmarks.

      <title>Accounting for Noise and Singularities in Bayesian Calibration Methods for Global 21-cm Cosmology Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the large dynamic ranges involved with separating the cosmological 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn from galactic foregrounds, a well-calibrated instrument is essential to avoid biases from instrumental systematics. In this paper we present three methods for calibrating a global 21-cm cosmology experiment using the noise wave parameter formalisation to characterise a low noise amplifier including a careful consideration of how calibrator temperature noise and singularities will bias the result. The first method presented in this paper builds upon the existing conjugate priors method by weighting the calibrators by a physically motivated factor, thereby avoiding singularities and normalising the noise. The second method fits polynomials to the noise wave parameters by marginalising over the polynomial coefficients and sampling the polynomial orders as parameters. The third method introduces a physically motivated noise model to the marginalised polynomial method. Running these methods on a suite of simulated datasets based on the REACH receiver design and a lab dataset, we found that our methods produced a calibration solution which is equally as or more accurate than the existing conjugate priors method when compared with an analytic estimate of the calibrator's noise. We find in the case of the measured lab dataset the conjugate priors method is biased heavily by the large noise on the shorted load calibrator, resulting in incorrect noise wave parameter fits. This is mitigated by the methods introduced in this paper which calibrate the validation source spectra to within 5% of the noise floor.</description>

      <title>A New Method to Derive an Empirical Lower Limit on the Mass Density of a UFO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I derive a lower limit on the mass of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) based on measurements of its speed and acceleration, as well as the infrared luminosity of the airglow around it. If the object's radial velocity can be neglected, the mass limit is independent of distance. Measuring the distance and angular size of the object allows to infer its minimum mass density. The Galileo Project will be collecting the necessary data on millions of objects in the sky over the coming year.</description>

      <title>Development of a High-Resolution, High-Dynamic-Range Charge Detector for Ion Beam Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an innovative charge detector with high resolution and wide dynamic range designed to fulfill the requirements of a monitoring system for a high energy ion beam. The detector prototype, constructed using Si photodiodes and a custom readout electronics, underwent extensive testing during HERD and AMS beam tests at CERN SPS facilities. Initial testing showcased the detector's exceptional performance, emphasizing both high resolution and a dynamic range capable of measuring nuclei with atomic numbers ranging from 1 to 80. The prototype's compatibility with fast, quasi real-time data analysis qualifies it as an ideal candidate for online applications. This article presents the results from the testing phase of the prototype, highlighting its capabilities and performance. Ongoing detector development, potential applications, and future developments aimed at enhancing the detector's functionality and versatility are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Filtering in CMB data analysis with application to ACT DR4 and Planck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by observed discrepancies between ACT DR4 and Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectra, particularly in the cross-correlation of temperature and E-mode polarization, we investigate challenges that may be encountered in the comparison of satellite and ground-based CMB data. In particular, we focus on the effects of Fourier-space filtering and masking involving bright point sources. We show that the filtering operation generates bright cross-shaped artifacts in the map, which stretch far outside typical point-source masks. If not corrected, these artifacts can add bias or additional variance to cross-spectra, skewing results. However we find that the effect of this systematic is not large enough to explain the ACT-Planck differences presented with ACT DR4.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based radiointerferometric imaging with GAN-aided training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio interferometry invariably suffers from an incomplete coverage of the spatial Fourier space, which leads to imaging artifacts. The current state-of-the-art technique is to create an image by Fourier-transforming the incomplete visibility data and to clean the systematic effects originating from incomplete data in Fourier space. Previously, we have shown how super-resolution methods based on convolutional neural networks can reconstruct sparse visibility data. Our previous work has suffered from a low realism of the training data. The aim of this work is to build a whole simulation chain for realistic radio sources that then leads to a vastly improved neural net for the reconstruction of missing visibilities. This method offers considerable improvements in terms of speed, automatization and reproducibility over the standard techniques. Here we generate large amounts of training data by creating images of radio galaxies with a generative adversarial network (GAN) that has been trained on radio survey data. Then, we applied the Radio Interferometer Measurement Equation (RIME) in order to simulate the measurement process of a radio interferometer. We show that our neural network can reconstruct faithfully images of realistic radio galaxies. The reconstructed images agree well with the original images in terms of the source area, integrated flux density, peak flux density, and the multi-scale structural similarity index. Finally, we show how the neural net can be adapted to estimate the uncertainties in the imaging process.</description>

Abstract: In this document we consider the problem of finding the optimal layout for the array of water Cherenkov detectors proposed by the SWGO collaboration to study very-high-energy gamma rays in the southern hemisphere. We develop a continuous model of the secondary particles produced by atmospheric showers initiated by high-energy gamma rays and protons, and build an optimization pipeline capable of identifying the most promising configuration of the detector elements. The pipeline employs stochastic gradient descent to maximize a utility function aligned with the scientific goals of the experiment. We demonstrate how the software is capable of finding the global maximum in the high-dimensional parameter space, and discuss its performance and limitations.</description>

      <title>maria: A novel simulator for forecasting (sub-)mm observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10731v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave single-dish telescopes offer two key advantages compared to interferometers: they can efficiently map larger portions of the sky, and they can recover larger spatial scales. Nonetheless, fluctuations in the atmosphere limit the accurate retrieval of signals from astronomical sources. To efficiently reduce atmospheric noise and filtering effects in current and future facilities, we introduce {\tt maria}, a versatile and user-friendly multi-purpose telescope simulator that optimizes scanning strategies and instrument designs, produces synthetic time-ordered data, time streams, and maps from hydrodynamical simulations, thereby enabling a fair comparison between theory and observations. Each mock observatory scans through the atmosphere in a configurable pattern over the celestial object. We generate evolving and location-and-time-specific weather for each of the fiducial sites using a combination of satellite and ground-based measurements. While {\tt maria} is a generic virtual telescope, this study specifically focuses on mimicking broadband bolometers observing at 100 GHz. We compare the mock time streams with real MUSTANG-2 observations and find that they are quantitatively similar by conducting a k-sample Anderson-Darling test resulting in a p-value of p&lt;0.001. Subsequently, we image the TODs to create noise maps and realistic mock observations of clusters of galaxies for both MUSTANG-2 and an instrument concept for the 50m Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST). Furthermore, using {\tt maria}, we find that a 50m dish provides the highest levels of correlation of atmospheric signals across adjacent detectors compared to smaller apertures (e.g., 42-cm and 6-m), facilitating removal of atmospheric signal on large scales.</description>

The 21-cm hydrogen line, emanating from the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, serves as a critical probe into this era. We describe the development and implementation of the spectrometer for CosmoCube, a novel lunar orbiting CubeSat designed to detect the redshifted 21-cm signal within the redshift range of 13 to 150. Our instrumentation utilizes a Xilinx RFSoC, which integrates both Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), tailored for the spectrometer component of the radiometer. This system is characterized by a 4096 FFT length at 62.5 kHz steps using a Polyphase Filter Bank (PFB), achieving an average Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) of 11.5 bits throughout the frequency of interest, from 10 MHz to 100 MHz. The spectrometer design is further refined through loopback tests involving both DAC and ADC of the RFSoC, with DAC outputs varying between high (+1 dBm) and low (-3 dBm) power modes to characterize system performance. The power consumption was optimized to 5.45 W using three ADCs and one DAC for the radiometer. Additionally, the stability of the ADC noise floor was investigated in a thermal chamber with environmental temperatures ranging from 5{\deg}C to 40{\deg}C. A consistent noise floor of approximately -152.5 dBFS/Hz was measured, with a variation of $\pm$0.2 dB, ensuring robust performance under varying thermal conditions.</description>

      <title>Data analysis of the NISP instrument for the Euclid mission: from the first validation tests on ground up to the verification phase after launch</title>

Abstract: The Euclid telescope, launched from Cape Canaveral on July 1st, 2023, is dedicated to studying dark matter and dark energy from its orbit at the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2. It is equipped with two instruments: the visual imager (VIS) and the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). The Euclid Wide Survey (Scaramella et al. 2022) will cover approximately 14500 deg2 of the extragalactic sky, and will be complemented by the Euclid Deep Survey that will cover about 40 deg2 and achieve two magnitudes fainter depth. Several ground-test campaigns were performed to assess NISP instrument basic functionalities and performances, some highlights will be reviewed in this thesis. The analysis comprises two key aspects: the evaluation of NISP image data acquired during ground-tests and during commissioning, and the verification of instrument performance in spectroscopic mode through the use of pixel-level simulated images. The analysis includes the characterisation of NISP detectors, from instrumental background to point-spread function (PSF) evaluations, confirming that NISP performance is well within the Euclid requirement. We introduce a calibration methodology to estimate the filter wheel assembly position from PSF distortions that have been successfully applied during the commissioning and will continue to be used during the mission for calibration purpose. Additionally, we investigated noise events that occur during image acquisition, with a particular focus on \v{S}snowballs\v{S} and cosmic ray tracks. Finally, we present a spectroscopic pixel-level simulation campaign of the NISP instrument, where spectral energy distributions were generated and processed by the Euclid spectroscopic channel simulator.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian expansions of extreme mass ratio inspirals of spinning bodies into Schwarzschild black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA are expected to detect inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes. Modeling such inspirals requires fully relativistic computations to achieve sufficient accuracy at leading order. However, subleading corrections such as the effects of the spin of the inspiraling compact object may potentially be treated in weak-field expansions such as the post-Newtonian (PN) approach.
  In this work, we calculate the PN expansion of eccentric orbits of spinning bodies around Schwarzschild black holes. Then we use the Teukolsky equation to compute the energy and angular momentum fluxes from these orbits up to the 5PN order. Some of these PN orders are exact in eccentricity, while others are expanded up to the tenth power in eccentricity. Then we use the fluxes to construct a hybrid inspiral model, where the leading part of the fluxes is calculated numerically in the fully relativistic regime, while the linear part in the small spin is analytically approximated using the PN series. We calculate LISA-relevant adiabatic inspirals and respective waveforms with this model and a fully relativistic model. Through the calculation of mismatch between the waveforms from both models we conclude that the PN approximation of the linear-in-spin part of the fluxes is sufficient for lower eccentricities.</description>

      <title>FCN4Flare: Fully Convolution Neural Networks for Flare Detection</title>

Abstract: Stellar flares offer invaluable insights into stellar magnetic activity and exoplanetary environments. Automated flare detection enables exploiting vast photometric datasets from missions like Kepler. This paper presents FCN4Flare, a deep learning approach using fully convolutional networks (FCN) for precise point-to-point flare prediction regardless of light curve length. Key innovations include the NaN Mask to handle missing data automatedly, and the Mask Dice loss to mitigate severe class imbalance. Experimental results show that FCN4Flare significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.64 compared to the state-of-the-art of 0.12. Applying FCN4Flare to Kepler-LAMOST data, we compile a catalog of 30,285 high-confidence flares across 1426 stars. Flare energies are estimated and stellar/exoplanet properties analyzed, identifying pronounced activity for an M-dwarf hosting a habitable zone planet. This work overcomes limitations of prior flare detection methods via deep learning, enabling new scientific discoveries through analysis of photometric time-series data.

      <title>Reliable Detections of Atmospheres on Rocky Exoplanets with Photometric JWST Phase Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of atmospheres on rocky planets is one of the major questions in exoplanet astronomy, but there are currently no published unambiguous detections of atmospheres on any rocky exoplanets. The MIRI instrument on JWST can measure thermal emission from tidally locked rocky exoplanets orbiting small, cool stars. This emission is a function of their surface and atmospheric properties, potentially allowing detections of atmospheres. One way to find atmospheres is to search for lower day-side emission than would be expected for a black body planet. Another technique is to measure phase curves of thermal emission to search for night-side emission due to atmospheric heat redistribution. Here, we compare strategies for detecting atmospheres on rocky exoplanets. We simulate secondary eclipse and phase curve observations in the MIRI F1500W and F1280W filters, for a range of surfaces (providing our open access albedo data) and atmospheres on thirty exoplanets selected for their F1500W signal-to-noise ratio. We show that secondary eclipse observations are more degenerate between surfaces and atmospheres than suggested in previous work, and that thick atmospheres can support emission consistent with a black body planet in these filters. These results make it difficult to unambiguously detect or rule out atmospheres using their photometric day-side emission alone. We suggest that an F1500W phase curve could instead be observed for a similar sample of planets. While phase curves are time-consuming and their instrumental systematics can be challenging, we suggest that they allow the only unambiguous detections of atmospheres by night-side thermal emission.</description>

      <title>The neutron veto of the XENONnT experiment: Results with demineralized water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05264v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiogenic neutrons emitted by detector materials are one of the most challenging backgrounds for the direct search of dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). To mitigate this background, the XENONnT experiment is equipped with a novel gadolinium-doped water Cherenkov detector, which encloses the xenon dual-phase time projection chamber (TPC). The neutron veto (NV) tags neutrons via their capture on gadolinium or hydrogen, which release $\gamma$-rays that are subsequently detected as Cherenkov light. In this work, we present the key features and the first results of the XENONnT NV when operated with demineralized water in the initial phase of the experiment. Its efficiency for detecting neutrons is $(82\pm 1)\,\%$, the highest neutron detection efficiency achieved in a water Cherenkov detector. This enables a high efficiency of $(53\pm 3)\,\%$ for the tagging of WIMP-like neutron signals, inside a tagging time window of $250\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ between TPC and NV, leading to a livetime loss of $1.6\,\%$ during the first science run of XENONnT.</description>

      <title>Efficient Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation via Knowledge Distillation: A ResNet1D-IAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of gravitational wave astronomy, the increasing number of detected events necessitates efficient methods for parameter estimation and model updates. This study presents a novel approach using knowledge distillation techniques to enhance computational efficiency in gravitational wave analysis. We develop a framework combining ResNet1D and Inverse Autoregressive Flow (IAF) architectures, where knowledge from a complex teacher model is transferred to a lighter student model. Our experimental results show that the student model achieves a validation loss of 3.70 with optimal configuration (40,100,0.75), compared to the teacher model's 4.09, while reducing the number of parameters by 43\%. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between teacher and student models remains below 0.0001 across network layers, indicating successful knowledge transfer. By optimizing ResNet layers (7-16) and hidden features (70-120), we achieve a 35\% reduction in inference time while maintaining parameter estimation accuracy. This work demonstrates significant improvements in computational efficiency for gravitational wave data analysis, providing valuable insights for real-time event processing.</description>
