      <title>Euler characteristics of Koll\'ar-hyperbolic varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Call a normal complex projective variety $X$ Koll\'ar-hyperbolic if any nonconstant map from a smooth projective curve to $X$ induces a nontrivial homomorphism of \'etale fundamental groups. Examples include (a) smooth varieties with finite Albanese map, (b) normalizations of subvarieties of hermitian locally symmetric varieties of noncompact type, and (c) higher dimensional Kodaira fibrations. We conjecture that Koll\'ar-hyperbolic varieties satisfy a vanishing theorem, which says roughly that if $P$ is perverse sheaf underlying a mixed Hodge module on such a variety then the limit of normalized dimensions of the cohomology groups of $P$ are zero in nonzero degrees, where the limit is taken over a suitable tower of \'etale covers. We call such varieties V-hyperbolic. V-hyperbolic varieties satisfy a Gromov type vanishing theorem for $L^2$ cohomology, the inequalities $(-1)^d\chi(X) \ge 0$ and $(-1)^{d-p}\chi(\Omega_X^p)\ge 0$ in the smooth case, and more generally, an inequality for mixed Hodge modules conjectured under related assumptions by Maxim, Wang and the author. We prove that examples of type (a) and (c) listed above are V-hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Relative Quasimaps and Tilting Module of $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the equivariant cohomology of the moduli space of quasimaps from $\mathbb{P}^1$ with one marked point to the flag variety. This moduli space has an open subset isomorphic to the Laumon space. The equivariant cohomology of the Laumon space carries a natural action of $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ constructed via geometric correspondences. We extend this construction to the entire quasimap moduli space and relate it to tilting modules of $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over the ring of integers of a perfectoid field of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ containing all $p$-power roots of unity, we prove that the prismatic cohomology of a locally finite free prismatic crystal is isomorphic to the $A_{\inf}$-cohomology of the corresponding relative Breuil-Kisin-Fargues module, which is a certain type of locally finite free $\mathbb{A}_{\inf}$-module, on the pro\'etale site of the generic fiber. We use a global description of the former in terms of $q$-Higgs modules via cohomological descent. We also discuss its compatibility with inverse image functors, scalar extensions under Frobenius, and tensor products.</description>

      <title>The Deligne-Riemann-Roch isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series devoted to Deligne's conjectural program on refined versions of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem via the determinant of the cohomology. We prove a general form of the Deligne-Riemann-Roch isomorphism, lifting the degree-one part of the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula to a canonical isomorphism of line bundles. This extends previous constructions and is formulated and proven in a flexible reinterpretation of Elkik's theory of intersection bundles introduced in the first paper of the series. This resolves the geometric aspect of Deligne's program. Among the applications, we derive a natural isomorphism relating the BCOV bundle and the Hodge bundle of a family of Calabi-Yau varieties, which is part of the mathematical formulation of the genus one mirror symmetry conjecture proposed in a previous work with Mourougane.</description>

      <title>Rational self-maps of projective surfaces with a regular iterate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $\Phi: X \dashrightarrow X$ is a dominant rational self-map of a projective surface $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$ with a regular and non-invertible iterate $\Phi^n$, then we can take $n \leq 12$. This bound is sharp and realized on $X = \mathbb{P}^2$. In the case where $\Phi$ is a birational self-map of $\mathbb{P}^2$ we prove that as long as $\Phi$ does not preserve a non-constant fibration, if some iterate $\Phi^n$ is regular then $\Phi$ itself must be regular.</description>

      <title>On the Quadratic Structure of Torsors over Affine Group Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ be a finite and flat group scheme over the ring of algebraic integers $R$ of a number field $K$ and suppose that the generic fiber of $\mathcal{G}$ is the constant group scheme over $K$ for a finite group $G$. Then the $R$-dual $A^D$of $A$ identifies as a Hopf $R$-order in the group algebra $K[G]$. If $B$ is a principal homogeneous space for $A$, then it is known that $B$ is a locally free $A^D$-module. By multiplying the trace form of $B_K/K$ by a certain scalar we obtain a $G$-invariant form $Tr'_B$ which provides a non-degenerate $R$-form on $B$. If $G$ has odd order, we show that the $G$-forms $(B, Tr'_B)$ and $(A, Tr'_A)$ are locally isomorphic and we study the question of when they are globally isomorphic.
  Suppose now that $K$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ with valuation ring $R$. In the course of our study we are led to consider the extension of scalars map $\varphi_K: G_0(A^D)\rightarrow G_0(A^D_K)=G_0(K[G])$. When $A^D$ is the group ring $R[G]$, Swan showed that $\varphi_K$ is an isomorphism. Jensen and Larson proved that $\varphi_K$ is also an isomorphism for any Hopf $R$-order $A^D$ of $K[G]$ when $G$ is abelian and $K$ is large enough. Here we prove that $\ker \varphi_K$ is at most a finite abelian $p$-group. However, numerous examples lead us to conjecture that Swan's result extends to all Hopf $R$-orders in $K[G]$, i.e. $\ker \varphi_K$ is always trivial.</description>

      <title>Joyce structures from quadratic differentials on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known examples of Joyce structures on spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials, we consider the isomonodromic deformations of particular second-order linear ODEs with rational potential. We show the infinitesimal isomonodromic deformations are the kernel of a closed $2$-form arising from the intersection pairing of an algebraic curve defined by the potential. This observation enables us to construct Joyce structures on a class of moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials on the Riemann sphere, and provides a new, geometric description of the hyper-K\"ahler structures of previously computed examples. We focus on the case of moduli of quadratic differentials with poles of odd orders, where we obtain a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry. We also include an example corresponding to the moduli space of quadratic differentials with four simple poles, which is a version of the classical isomonodromy problem that leads to the Painlev\'{e} VI equation.</description>

      <title>Genus Two Stable Maps, Local Equations and Modular Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2427</link>
      <description>arXiv:1201.2427v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a geometric construction of a sequence of modular blowups of the Artin stack parameterizing pre-stable pairs consisting of a genus-two nodal curve and a smooth divisor. The resulting stack locally diagonalizes the tautological derived objects associated with the moduli of stable maps from genus-two curves to projective space. As a consequence, the singularities of the main component of the moduli space of stable maps are resolved, and the entire space admits only normal crossing singularities. Our approach is expected to generalize to higher genera.</description>

      <title>A theory of stacks with twisted fields and resolution of moduli of genus two stable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.03384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a smooth algebraic stack of tuples consisting of genus two nodal curves, simple effective divisors away from the nodes, and twisted fields. It provides a desingularization of the moduli of genus two stable maps to projective spaces. The construction is based on systematic application of the theory of stacks with twisted fields (STF), which has its prototype appeared in arXiv:1201.2427 and arXiv:1906.10527 and is fully developed in this article. As a byproduct of the STF theory, we also obtain a novel desingularization of the moduli of genus one stable maps to projective spaces, which is isomorphic to the blowup that reverses the order used by Vakil-Zinger and Hu-Li. The results of this article are the second step of a program toward the resolutions of the moduli of stable maps of higher genera.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic liftings and 2d TQFT for dormant opers of higher level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08528v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript represents an advance in the enumerative geometry of opers that takes the subject beyond our previous work. Motivated by a counting problem of linear differential equations in positive characteristic, we investigate the moduli space of opers from arithmetic and combinatorial points of view. We construct a compactified moduli space classifying dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_n^{(N)}$-opers (i.e., dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-opers of level $N$) on pointed stable curves in characteristic $p&gt;0$. One of the key results is the generic \'{e}taleness of that space for $n=2$, which is proved by obtaining a detailed understanding of relevant deformation spaces. This fact induces a certain arithmetic lifting of each dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-oper on a general curve to characteristic $p^N$; this lifting is called the canonical diagonal lifting. On the other hand, the generic \'{e}taleness also implies that the degree function for the moduli spaces in the rank $2$ case satisfies factorization properties determined by various gluing morphisms of the underlying curves. That is to say, the degree function forms a $2$d TQFT (= a $2$-dimensional topological quantum field theory); it leads us to describe dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-opers in terms of edge numberings on trivalent graphs, as well as lattice points inside generalized rational polytopes. These results yield an effective way of computing the numbers of such objects and $2$nd order differential equations in characteristic $p^N$ with a full set of solutions.</description>

Abstract: We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Frobenius pull-back of parabolic bundles and dormant opers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parabolic bundles on an algebraic curve in positive characteristic. Our motivation is to properly formulate Frobenius pull-backs of parabolic bundles in a way that extends various previous facts and arguments for the usual non-parabolic Frobenius pull-backs. After defining that operation, we generalize a classical result by Cartier concerning Frobenius descent, that is, we establish a bijective correspondence (including the version using higher-level $\mathcal{D}$-modules) between parabolic flat bundles with vanishing $p$-curvature on a pointed curve and parabolic bundles on its Frobenius twist. This correspondence gives a description of maximally Frobenius-destabilized parabolic bundles in terms of dormant opers admitting logarithmic poles. As an application of that description together with a previous result in the enumerative geometry of dormant opers, we obtain an explicit formula for computing the number of such parabolic bundles of rank $2$ under certain assumptions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bridgeland Stability Conditions on the Category of Coherent Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide a broad class of examples of stability conditions on the category of coherent sheaves which generalise Gieseker stability. We refer to them as "adapted to coherent sheaves" and they admit Harder--Narasimhan and Jordan--H\"older filtrations. We also study the particular case of Bayer's polynomial Bridgeland stability conditions, and their relation to the gauge theoretical counterpart introduced by Dervan--McCarthy--Sektnan.</description>

      <title>Reflexive polytopes and the Picard ranks of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the sum of the Picard ranks of a polar pair of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties of dimension $d\geq 3$ is at most the minimum of the number of facets and vertices of the corresponding pair of reflexive polytopes minus $(d-1)$. This is a generalization of Eikelberg's theory of affine dependences describing the Picard groups of toric varieties. The upper bound is achieved if and only if the polar pair is a simple-simplicial pair.</description>

      <title>On pluricanonical boundedness of varieties of general type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new proof of a theorem of Chen and Jiang: for any integer $n&gt;1$, there is a constant $K_n&gt;0$ such that every smooth projective $n$-fold $X$ with $\operatorname{vol}(X)&gt;K_n$ has either the stable birational $2$-canonical map or a M$^c$Kernan fibration. This amends a gap in the original proof of Theorem 6.8 (at page 2078) in Annales de l'Institut Fourier, volume 67 (2017). As a direct application of our method, we improve a former boundedness theorem of Lacini and prove that for any integer $r&gt;1$ and $n\geq 1$, $r$-canonical maps of $n$-folds of general type have birationally bounded fibers.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Orbit Construction of GKZ-Type Systems for Commutative Linear Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Fourier-orbit construction of GKZ-type D-modules associated with commutative linear algebraic group actions G = TU (where T is an algebraic torus and U a unipotent group) on a vector space V. This framework generalizes the classical toric GKZ system to mixed torus-unipotent settings. We establish generic holonomicity via a parameter-free symbolic moment ideal, develop symbolic tools for rank analysis, and exhibit new families with Airy-type irregular behavior. Our approach recovers the classical GKZ rank formula in the pure torus case and provides explicit lower bounds in the mixed case.</description>

      <title>An axiomatic approach to analytic $1$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of $1$-affineness was originally formulated by Gaitsgory in the context of derived algebraic geometry. Motivated by applications to rigid and analytic geometry, we introduce two very general and abstract frameworks where it makes sense to ask for objects to be $1$-affine with respect to some sheaf of categories. The first framework is suited for studying the problem of $1$-affineness when the sheaf of categories arises from an operation in a six-functor formalism over $\mathscr{C}$; we apply it to the setting of analytic stacks and condensed mathematics. The second one concerns $1$-affineness in the context of quasi-coherent sheaves of categorical modules over stable module categories: it simultaneously generalizes the algebro-geometric setting of Gaitsgory and makes it possible to formulate the problem also when dealing with rigid analytic varieties and categories of nuclear modules.</description>

      <title>On the Homogeneous Space of a Pair of Associative Composition Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between associative composition algebras of dimensions 2 and 4 within the context of homogeneous spaces, with a particular focus on Hamiltonian quaternions, is explored. In the special case of Hamiltonian quaternions, the equivariant cohomology rings of the homogeneous spaces are computed to gain a deeper understanding of their topological structure. In the general case, equivariant K-theory is utilized to examine the categories of vector bundles on these spaces. Taking this one step further, the Grothendieck ring of the category of locally free modules on the variety of singular matrices of size $n$ with entries from an associative composition algebra is determined. As a natural extension of these ideas, to define and study determinantal varieties of matrices with entries from a composition algebra, a notion of rank with respect to the base composition algebra is introduced, and criteria are established for the spanning set of a finite set of matrices with entries from the associative composition algebra to contain elements of certain ranks.</description>

      <title>Higher modularity of elliptic curves over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a notion of "higher modularity" for elliptic curves over function fields. Given such an elliptic curve $E$ and an integer $r\geq 1$, we say that $E$ is $r$-modular when there is an algebraic correspondence between a stack of $r$-legged shtukas, and the $r$-fold product of $E$ considered as an elliptic surface. The (known) case $r=1$ is analogous to the notion of modularity for elliptic curves over $\mathbf{Q}$. Our main theorem is that if $E/\mathbf{F}_q(t)$ is a nonisotrivial elliptic curve whose conductor has degree 4, then $E$ is 2-modular. Ultimately, the proof uses properties of K3 surfaces. Along the way we prove a result of independent interest: A K3 surface admits a finite morphism to a Kummer surface attached to a product of elliptic curves if and only if its Picard lattice is rationally isometric to the Picard lattice of such a Kummer surface.</description>

      <title>On Harish-Chandra modules over quantizations of nilpotent orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over the complex numbers and $K$ be a connected reductive group mapping to $G$ so that the Lie algebra of $K$ gets identified with a symmetric subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. So we can talk about Harish-Chandra $(\mathfrak{g},K)$-modules, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$. The goal of this paper is to give a geometric classification of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules with full support over the filtered quantizations of the algebras of the form $\mathbb{C}[\mathbb{O}]$, where $\mathbb{O}$ is a nilpotent orbit in $\mathfrak{g}$ with codimension of the boundary at least $4$. Namely, we embed the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules into the set of isomorphism classes of irreducible $K$-equivariant suitably twisted local systems on $\mathbb{O}\cap \mathfrak{k}^\perp$. We show that under certain conditions, for example when $K\subset G$ or when $\mathfrak{g}\cong \mathfrak{so}_n,\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$, this embedding is in fact a bijection. On the other hand, for $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_n$ and $K=\operatorname{Spin}_n$, the embedding is not bijective and we give a description of the image. Finally, we perform a partial classification for exceptional Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Linear complete symmetric rank-distance codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$ is called complete if it is not contained in a larger $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear code of minimum distance $d$. In this paper, we classify $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear complete symmetric rank-distance (CSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$ up to equivalence. This includes the classification of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear maximum symmetric rank-distance (MSRD) codes in $M_{3\times 3}(\mathbb{F}_q)$. Our approach is mainly geometric, and our results contribute towards the classification of nets of conics in $\mathrm{PG}(2, q)$.</description>

      <title>Permutation twisted cohomology, remixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize Balmer and Gallauer's (permutation) twisted cohomology ring, working toward an alternative method of deducing the Balmer spectrum of the derived category of permutation modules for any finite $p$-group. The construction comes equipped with a canonical comparison map from the Balmer spectrum to the homogeneous spectrum of the twisted cohomology ring. We show the comparison map is injective for any finite $p$-group and furthermore, an open immersion when the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian. For elementary abelian $p$-groups, the twisted cohomology ring coincides with Balmer and Gallauer's original construction.
  To perform this construction, we utilize endotrivial complexes (i.e. the invertible objects of the derived category of permutation modules) arising up to a shift from Bredon homology of representation spheres. This topological structure allows us to construct certain $p$-local isomorphisms, from which we build a refined open cover of the Balmer spectrum indexed by conjugacy classes of subgroups of $G$. Under this open cover, every endotrivial is isomorphic to a shift of the tensor unit in each localization, thus verifying that all endotrivials are line bundles. When the twisted cohomology ring is noetherian, this open cover endows the Balmer spectrum with Dirac scheme structure.</description>
