      <title>Simulation-Based Inference for Probabilistic Galaxy Detection and Deblending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stage-IV dark energy wide-field surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will observe an unprecedented number density of galaxies. As a result, the majority of imaged galaxies will visually overlap, a phenomenon known as blending. Blending is expected to be a leading source of systematic error in astronomical measurements. To mitigate this systematic, we propose a new probabilistic method for detecting, deblending, and measuring the properties of galaxies, called the Bayesian Light Source Separator (BLISS). Given an astronomical survey image, BLISS uses convolutional neural networks to produce a probabilistic astronomical catalog by approximating the posterior distribution over the number of light sources, their centroids' locations, and their types (galaxy vs. star). BLISS additionally includes a denoising autoencoder to reconstruct unblended galaxy profiles. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility of BLISS for cosmological applications, we apply our method to simulated single-band images whose properties are representative of year-10 LSST coadds. First, we study each BLISS component independently and examine its probabilistic output as a function of SNR and degree of blending. Then, by propagating the probabilistic detections from BLISS to its deblender, we produce per-object flux posteriors. Using these posteriors yields a substantial improvement in aperture flux residuals relative to deterministic detections alone, particularly for highly blended and faint objects. These results highlight the potential of BLISS as a scalable, uncertainty-aware tool for mitigating blending-induced systematics in next-generation cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>MARVEL: A Multi Agent-based Research Validator and Enabler using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MARVEL (https://ligogpt.mit.edu/marvel), a locally deployable, open-source framework for domain-aware question answering and assisted scientific research. It is designed to address the increasing demands of a digital assistant for scientific groups that can read highly technical data, cite precisely, and operate within authenticated networks. MARVEL combines a fast path for straightforward queries with a more deliberate DeepSearch mode that integrates retrieval-augmented generation and Monte Carlo Tree Search. It explores complementary subqueries, allocates more compute to promising branches, and maintains a global evidence ledger that preserves sources during drafting. We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive. By making the complete framework and evaluation datasets openly available, we aim to provide a reproducible foundation for developing domain-specific scientific assistants.</description>

      <title>Modelling spacecraft-emitted electrons measured by SWA-EAS experiment on board Solar Orbiter mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal electron measurements in space plasmas typically suffer at low energies from spacecraft emissions of photo- and secondary electrons and from charging of the spacecraft body. We examine these effects by use of numerical simulations in the context of electron measurements acquired by the Electron Analyser System (SWA-EAS) on board the Solar Orbiter mission. We employed the Spacecraft Plasma Interaction Software to model the interaction of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft with solar wind plasma and we implemented a virtual detector to simulate the measured electron energy spectra as observed in situ by the SWA-EAS experiment. Numerical simulations were set according to the measured plasma conditions at 0.3~AU. We derived the simulated electron energy spectra as detected by the virtual SWA-EAS experiment for different electron populations and compared these with both the initial plasma conditions and the corresponding real SWA-EAS data samples. We found qualitative agreement between the simulated and real data observed in situ by the SWA-EAS detector. Contrary to other space missions, the contamination by cold electrons emitted from the spacecraft is seen well above the spacecraft potential energy threshold. A detailed analysis of the simulated electron energy spectra demonstrates that contamination above the threshold is a result of cold electron fluxes emitted from distant spacecraft surfaces. The relative position of the break in the simulated spectrum with respect to the spacecraft potential slightly deviates from that in the real observations. This may indicate that the real potential of the SWA-EAS detector with respect to ambient plasma differs from the spacecraft potential value measured on board. The overall contamination is shown to be composed of emissions from a number of different sources and their relative contribution varies with the ambient plasma conditions.</description>

      <title>Science with a large field-of-view polarization survey: The Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence ($\lesssim 1$ day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg$^2$. With a 15 x 1-minute exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude $\sim$20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree (PD) will reach 0.7\%, 1.5\%, and 3.5\% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2.7 arcsec, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations. We propose three distinct non-simultaneous survey strategies, among them an active galactic nuclei (AGN) strategy for long-term monitoring of $\sim$200 AGN with $&lt;$1-day cadence. In this paper, we present the predicted sensitivity of the instrument and outline the various science cases it is designed to explore.</description>

      <title>Polarization rotation through differential transmission in refractive CMB telescopes identified using a hybrid physical optics method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a polarization rotation systematic in the far field beams of refractive cosmic microwave background (CMB) telescopes caused by differential transmission in anti-reflection (AR) coatings of optical elements. This systematic was identified following the development of a hybrid physical optics method that incorporates full-wave electromagnetic simulations of AR coatings to model the full polarization response of refractive systems. Applying this method to a two-lens CMB telescope with non-ideal AR coating, we show that polarization-dependent transmission can produce a rotation of the far-field polarization angle that varies across the focal plane with a typical amplitude of 0.05-0.5 degrees. If ignored in analysis, this effect can produce temperature to polarization leakage and Stokes Q/U mixing.</description>

      <title>Can Dynamic Spectrum Sharing Protect Passive Radio Sciences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) is increasingly promoted as a key element of modern spectrum policy, driven by the rising demand from commercial wireless systems and advances in spectrum access technologies. Passive radio sciences, including radio astronomy, Earth remote sensing, and meteorology, operate under fundamentally different constraints. They rely on exceptionally low interference spectrum and are highly vulnerable to even brief radio frequency interference. We examine whether DSS can benefit passive services or whether it introduces new failure modes and enforcement challenges. We propose just-in-time quiet zones (JITQZ) as a mechanism for protecting high value observations and assess hybrid frameworks that preserve static protection for core passive bands while allowing constrained dynamic access in adjacent frequencies. We analyze the roles of propagation uncertainty, electromagnetic compatibility constraints, and limited spectrum awareness. Using a game theoretic framework, we show why non-cooperative sharing fails, identify conditions for sustained cooperation, and examine incentive mechanisms including pseudonymetry-enabled attribution that promote compliance. We conclude that DSS can support passive radio sciences only as a high-reliability, safety-critical system. Static allocations remain essential, and dynamic access is viable only with conservative safeguards and enforceable accountability.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lorentz and parity violations in gravity with multiband gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the capability of future multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole coalescences, utilizing joint third-generation ground-based (CE, ET) and space-based (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) detector networks, to constrain parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in the gravitational sector. We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $\beta$ (i.e., $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, $\beta_{\nu}$, and $\beta_{\mu}$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) "golden event" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($\beta &gt; 0$) and low-frequency ($\beta &lt; 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($\beta &gt; 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($\beta &lt; 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.</description>

      <title>Broadband spectroscopy of astrophysical ice analogues: IV. Optical constants of N$_2$ ice in the terahertz and mid-infrared ranges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates.
  Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data.
  Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations.
  Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\nu_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal.
  Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.</description>

      <title>A constrained-transport embedded boundary method for compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the increased interest in pulsed-power magneto-inertial fusion devices in recent years, we present a method for implementing an arbitrarily shaped embedded boundary on a Cartesian mesh while solving the equations of compressible resistive magnetohydrodynamics. The method is built around a finite volume formulation of the equations in which a Riemann solver is used to compute fluxes on the faces between grid cells, and a face-centered constrained transport formulation of the induction equation. The small time step problem associated with the cut cells is avoided by always computing fluxes on the faces and edges of the Cartesian mesh. We extend the method to model a moving interface between two materials with different properties using a ghost-fluid approach, and show some preliminary results including shock-wave-driven and magnetically-driven dynamical compressions of magnetohydrostatic equilibria. We present a thorough verification of the method and show that it converges at second order in the absence of discontinuities, and at first order with a discontinuity in material properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>

      <title>A simple, flexible method for timing cross-calibration of space missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The timing (cross-)calibration of astronomical instruments is often done by comparing pulsar times-of-arrival (TOAs) to a reference timing model. In high-energy astronomy, the choice of solar system ephemerides and source positions used to barycenter the photon arrival times has a significant impact on the procedure, requiring a full reprocessing of the data each time a new convention is used. Our method, developed as part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), adapts an existing pulsar solution to arbitrary JPL ephemerides and source positions by simulating geocentric TOAs and refitting timing models (implemented with PINT). We validate the procedure and apply it to thousands of observations of the Crab pulsar from 15 missions spanning 1996--2025, demonstrating inter-ephemeris TOA consistency at the $\lesssim5 \mu$s level, using the DE200/FK5-based Jodrell Bank Monthly Ephemeris as a common reference. We release the TOAExtractor open-source tool and a TOA database to support future calibration and scientific studies. Instrument timing performance is broadly consistent with mission specifications; the X-ray-to-radio phase offset varies with energy and time at a level that is marginally consistent with the uncertainties of the radio ephemeris, motivating coordinated multiwavelength follow-up.</description>

      <title>Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>Measuring the muon content of inclined air showers using AERA and the water-Cherenkov detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for assessing the muon content of air showers with large zenith angles on a combined analysis of their radio emission and particle footprint. We use the radiation energy reconstructed by the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) as an energy estimator and determine the muon number independently with the water-Cherenkov detector array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, deployed on a 1500 m grid. We focus our analysis on air showers with primary energy above 4 EeV to ensure full detection efficiency. Over approximately ten years of accumulated data, we identify a set of 40 high-quality events that are used in the analysis. The estimated muon contents in data are compatible with those for iron primaries as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models. This result can be interpreted as a deficit of muons in simulations as a lighter mass composition has been established from Xmax measurements. This muon deficit was already observed in previous analyses of the Auger Collaboration and is confirmed using hybrid events that include radio measurements for the first time.</description>

      <title>The Open mulTiwavelength Transient Event Repository (OTTER): Infrastructure Release and Tidal Disruption Event Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiwavelength analyses of astrophysical transients are essential for understanding the physics of these events. To make such analyses more efficient and effective, we present the Open mulTiwavelength Transient Event Repository (OTTER), a publicly available catalog of published transient event metadata and photometry. Unlike previous efforts, our data schema is optimized for the storage of multiwavelength photometric datasets spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum from multiple published sources. Open source software, including an application programming interface (API) and web application, are available for viewing, accessing, and analyzing the dataset. For the initial release of OTTER, we present the largest ever photometric archive of tidal disruption event (TDE) candidates, including $\gtrsim 118,000$ observations of 240 TDE candidates spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We demonstrate the power of this infrastructure through four example analyses of the TDE population. We plan to maintain this dataset as more TDE candidates are proposed in the future and encourage other users to contribute by uploading newly published data via our web application. The infrastructure was built with the goal of archiving additional transient data (supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast blue optical transients, fast radio bursts, etc.) in the future. The web application is available at https://otter.idies.jhu.edu and the API documentation is available at https://astro-otter.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>Energy calibration of LHAASO-KM2A using the cosmic ray Moon shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of the westward, rigidity-dependent shift of the Moon's shadow using three and a half years of cosmic-ray data collected by the Kilometer Square Array (KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). These measurements enable us to calibrate the detector energy response in the range 20-260 TeV, with results showing excellent agreement with the response derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the KM2A detector. We also measure a best-fit parameter $\epsilon = 0.015 \pm 0.08$, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval of [-14%, +17%] for the energy-scale estimation. This result establishes the exceptional accuracy of the KM2A-MC in simulating the detector's response within this energy range.</description>

      <title>When the Shadow Meets Its Measure: Assessing the Feasibility of Submillimeter Black Hole Shadow Imaging in Megamaser Disk AGN</title>

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting water megamaser disks enable exceptionally precise geometric determinations of black hole mass, distance, inclination, and dynamical center. In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond SgrA* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</description>

      <title>Where does the simplified Stellar Contamination Model fail in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy?</title>

Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</description>
