      <title>Reallocating Wasted Votes in Proportional Parliamentary Elections with Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many proportional parliamentary elections, electoral thresholds (typically 3-5%) are used to promote stability and governability by preventing the election of parties with very small representation. However, these thresholds often result in a significant number of "wasted votes" cast for parties that fail to meet the threshold, which reduces representativeness. One proposal is to allow voters to specify replacement votes, by either indicating a second choice party or by ranking a subset of the parties, but there are several ways of deciding on the scores of the parties (and thus the composition of the parliament) given those votes. We introduce a formal model of party voting with thresholds, and compare a variety of party selection rules axiomatically, and experimentally using a dataset we collected during the 2024 European election in France. We identify three particularly attractive rules, called Direct Winners Only (DO), Single Transferable Vote (STV) and Greedy Plurality (GP).</description>

      <title>Implementation with Uncertain Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a full implementation problem where a socially desirable outcome depends on a state of the world which is unknown to the designer but (commonly) known to a set of agents. The designer may ask the agents to present hard evidence which they privately draw from a distribution depending on the state. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for implementation in (mixed-strategy) Bayesian Nash equilibria called No Perfect Deceptions (NPD). When agents also face uncertainty about the state and are informationally small (McLean and Postlewaite (2002)), a generalization of the NPD condition (GNPD) is sufficient for implementation and necessary when the information size is zero. Our implementing mechanisms accommodate the case with two or more agents, invoke no integer/modulo games, and impose transfers that in equilibrium vanish with the agents' information size.</description>

      <title>Should the Timing of Inspections be Predictable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01385v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A principal hires an agent to work on a long-term project that culminates in a breakthrough or a breakdown. At each time, the agent privately chooses to work or shirk. Working increases the arrival rate of breakthroughs and decreases the arrival rate of breakdowns. To motivate the agent to work, the principal conducts costly inspections. She fires the agent if shirking is detected. We characterize the principal's optimal inspection policy. Predictable inspections are optimal if work primarily generates breakthroughs. Random inspections are optimal if work primarily prevents breakdowns. Crucially, the agent's actions determine his risk attitude over the timing of punishments.</description>

      <title>Turning the Ratchet: Dynamic Screening with Multiple Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic contracting problem with multiple agents and limited commitment. A principal seeks to screen efficient agents using one-period contracts, but is tempted to revise contract terms upon knowing an agent's type. Alterations of contracts are observable and, hence, whenever past promises are broken future information revelation stops. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which information revelation can be fostered. For sufficiently patient players, private information is either never revealed or fully revealed in a sequential manner. Optimal contracts provide high-powered incentives upon initial disclosure of an agent's type, and rewards for information revelation vanish over time.</description>
