      <title>Three-Dimensional Fermi Surface, Van Hove Singularity and Enhancement of Superconductivity in Infinite-Layer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments reveal a three-dimensional (3D) Fermi surface with a clear $k_z$ dispersion in infinite-layer nickelates, distinguishing them from their cuprate superconductor counterparts. However, the impact of this difference on the superconducting properties of nickelates remains unclear. Here, we employ a combined random-phase-approximation and dynamical-mean-field-theory (RPA+DMFT) approach to solve the linearized gap equation for superconductivity. We find that, compared to the cuprate-like two-dimensional (2D) single-orbital Fermi surface, the van Hove singularities on the 3D Fermi surface of infinite-layer nickelates strengthen spin fluctuations by driving the system closer to antiferromagnetic instabilities, thereby significantly enhancing superconductivity. Our findings underscore the critical role of the van Hove singularities in shaping the superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelates and, more broadly, highlight the importance of subtle Fermi surface features in modeling material-specific unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in a semiconductor doped with the resonance negative U-centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of doping the semiconductor with the resonance negative U-centers upon its superconducting transition temperature. The attraction of electrons at the U-centers leads to the enhancement of transition temperature. On the contrary, the resonant scattering of conduction electrons along with their hybridization at the U-centers results in reducing the transition temperature. The largest effect on the superconducting transition temperature takes place if the resonance width is of the order of the energy level at the U-center. In the lack of the electron-phonon coupling under sufficiently low concentration of U-centers the superconducting transition is entirely absent in spite of the presence of attraction between electrons at U-centers.</description>

      <title>Practical way to increase nonlinearity of kinetic inductance of superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that depositing a thin layer of Mo (5-15 nm) onto a 10 nm thick NbN strip leads to a significant increase in the nonlinearity of the kinetic inductance $L_k$. Specifically, the change in $L_k$ with increasing current reached 70% in the NbN/Mo bilayer at liquid helium temperature, whereas in the NbN strip, $L_k$ changed by only 10% in the superconducting state. In addition to altering the nonlinear properties, the Mo layer caused a significant increase in the critical current at low temperatures (up to 2 times in the case of a 5 nm thick Mo layer). The increased nonlinearity of $L_k$ can be explained by two factors: i) a reduction of the critical supervelocity at which the superconducting state becomes unstable with respect to vortex formation when a Mo layer is deposited on NbN, and ii) a higher sensitivity of the induced superconductivity in Mo to supervelocity/supercurrent. Considering the results on the transport properties of SN bilayers with a high ratio of layer resistivities $\rho_S/\rho_N &gt;&gt; 1$, it can be concluded that depositing a thin layer of a relatively low-resistivity metal onto a superconductor with high $\rho$ is a practical method for achieving a large nonlinearity of the superconductor's kinetic inductance.</description>

      <title>$X$-type electrides hosting skin-like interstitial electron states and doping-enhanced superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of electrides is of great significance for the fundamental physics due to their unique properties arising from interstitial anionic electrons. Here we report a novel class of $X$-type electrides, distinguished by two distinct anionic electron subchannels forming alternating chains in real space. Through structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify two-dimensional $M_2$N ($M$ = Ti, Zr, Hf) materials as prototypical systems exhibiting these unique features. The anionic electron channels on the upper and lower surfaces of these materials display a vertically alternating pattern, with their projected bands revealing momentum-dependent splitting behavior in the reciprocal space, protected by a crystal symmetry operation $O$. Notably, the $X$-type electride characteristic is independent of the layer number and remains robust on the upper and lower surfaces of layered structures, presenting a pronounced skin-like effect. Additionally, we have explored the superconductivity of these systems, and found that both Ti$_2$N and Zr$_2$N are intrinsic superconductors with superconducting transition temperatures below 1.0 K. Further results show that appropriate hole doping can significantly enhance their superconducting transition temperatures and can induce the Hf$_2$N monolayer to exhibit superconductivity. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design and tuning of novel electrides with enhanced superconducting properties, offering a new pathway for deeply understanding the interplay between electride behavior and superconductivity in novel materials.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking in microscopic single-crystal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity is a quintessential unconventional quantum state. In Josephson junctions, time-reversal symmetry breaking manifests itself in the supercurrent interference pattern as the invariance of the critical current under the reversal of both transport and magnetic field directions, i.e., $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$. So far, such systems have been realized in devices where superconductivity is injected into a deliberately constructed weak link medium, usually carefully tuned by external magnetic fields and electrostatic gating. In this work, we report time-reversal symmetry breaking in spontaneously emerging Josephson junctions without intentionally constructed weak links. This is realized in ultra-pure single-crystal microstructures of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, an unconventional superconductor with a multi-component order parameter. Here, the Josephson effect emerges intrinsically at the superconducting domain wall, where the degenerate states partially overlap. In addition to violating $I_\text{c+}(H) = I_\text{c-}(-H)$, we find a rich variety of exotic transport phenomena, including a supercurrent diode effect present in the entire interference pattern, two-channel critical current oscillations with a period that deviates from $\Phi_0$, fractional Shapiro steps, and current-switchable bistable states with highly asymmetric critical currents. Our findings provide direct evidence of TRSB in unstrained Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ and reveal the potential of domain wall Josephson junctions, which can emerge in any superconductor where the pairing symmetry is described by a multi-component order parameter.</description>

      <title>Evolution of quantum criticality in underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum criticality, with both static and dynamic information of the system intrinsically encoded in characteristic length scales, serves as one of the most sensitive and universal probes to monitor quantum phase transition. Qualitatively different quantum criticality behaviours have been widely observed even in the same condensed matter system. The discrepancy is attributed to sample specificity but has not been systemically addressed. Here we report a single-parameter driven three-stage evolution of quantum criticality unveiled in superconductor-insulator transition in underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} flakes. The evolution starts with a single quantum critical point emerging at the boundary between the superconducting and antiferromagnetic phases, then evolving into anomalous quantum Griffiths singularity at the medium doping levels and eventually being replaced by quantum Griffiths singularity in the deep superconducting regime. A puddle model that incorporates the developments of antiferromagnetic correlation can capture the evolution. The results offer a new aspect to examine previous seemingly sample-specific quantum critical behavior and lay the foundation for further exploring complex quantum criticality in strongly correlated systems; meanwhile they shed light on the detailed interaction between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic signature of anisotropic order parameter in Kagome lattice superconductor LaRh$_3$B$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of the Kagome metal LaRh$_3$B$_2$ along with its superconductivity below 2.6 K, unlike other popular Kagome metals, is not known to be significantly influenced by the electron correlations. While the indirect techniques to probe the bulk superconducting properties of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ indicate a conventional isotropic order parameter, we show that the direct spectroscopic determination of the superconducting energy gap reveals an anomalous suppression of Andreev reflection between LaRh$_3$B$_2$ and a normal metal. This observation hints to the presence of incomplete superconducting gap formation, at least along certain momentum directions, and consequent low-lying quasiparticle states. An analysis of multiple Andreev reflection spectra captured at different points on the surface of LaRh$_3$B$_2$ reveals a distribution of the superconducting energy gap which is consistent with an anisotropic superconducting order parameter.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Superconductivity by Fully Compensated Ferrimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a platform based on a fully compensated ferrimagnet (fFIM) for realizing and controlling topological superconductivity with Majorana bound states across multiple dimensions. Through symmetry analysis and microscopic modeling, we demonstrate that fFIM-based heterostructures host (i) Majorana zero modes localized at the ends of one-dimensional nanowires, (ii) chiral Majorana edge states along two-dimensional boundaries, and (iii) tunable Majorana corner modes in higher-order topological phases. The unique properties of fFIMs enable an electric field to drive topological superconductivity phase transitions and N\'eel vector orientation to control the spatial distribution of Majorana modes, without external magnetic fields. Crucially, the absence of net magnetization in fFIM-based heterostructures preserves superconductivity, circumventing the usual trade-off between tunability and superconducting coherence in magnetized systems. Our results establish fFIM-based heterostructures as a versatile platform for tunable topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Braiding: Topological Superconductivity Unlocked under Nearly Arbitrary Magnetic Field Directions in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZM), distinguished by their non-locality and non-Abelian statistics, are central to the pursuit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Planar Josephson junctions (PJJ) have emerged as a promising platform, offering robust and tunable MZM. However, the perceived sensitivity of topological superconductivity to the magnetic field orientation has posed a major obstacle, particularly for scalable network architectures. Here, we uncover that topological superconductivity in PJJ fundamentally persists under nearly arbitrary in-plane magnetic field directions. The apparent collapse of the global gap under misaligned fields originates not from the destruction of superconductivity itself, but from emergent shifted bulk states from other momentum points, which obscure the gap and MZM. By introducing spatial modulations along the junction to scatter and gap out these bulk states, we restore the global topological gap and recover visible MZM. Remarkably, the spatially modulated PJJs render topological superconductivity robust against maligned fields, thereby enabling MZM survival across complex junction networks and facilitating their braiding. We propose a scalable protocol for MZM braiding and fusion with phase or gate control, opening new routes toward scalable topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamic road to gravity and quantum phenomena: non-relativistic self-gravitating weakly nonlocal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A thermodynamic analysis of weakly nonlocal non-relativistic fluids is presented under the assumption that an additional scalar field - a so-called internal variable - also contributes to the dynamics. The most general evolution of this field and the constitutive relations for the pressure tensor and the energy current density are determined by the Liu procedure. The classical holography of perfect (i.e., non-dissipative) fluids is generally proved, according to which the divergence of the pressure tensor can be given by the gradient of a corresponding scalar potential. Both Newtonian gravity and quantum fluid mechanics are covered as special cases of our fluid model. The unified framework generalises and couples quantum physics and gravitational phenomena, shedding light on the common background of several known modifications and generalisations together with thermodynamic restrictions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Sn-Intercalated TaSe$_2$: Structural Diversity Obscured by Conventional Characterization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Sn-intercalated TaSe$_2$ as a model system, we uncover structural heterogeneity by single-crystal X-ray diffraction that eludes the common characterization techniques of powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and electrical transport measurements. From a single growth composition (1:1:2 Sn:Ta:Se), we obtain diverse stoichiometries and structures, with near-continuous intercalation for Sn$_x$TaSe$_2$ from $0\leq\textrm{x}\leq1$. Using single-crystal X-ray diffraction, we identify four new structures: Sn$_{0.18}$TaSe$_{1.92}$ ($R3m$), Sn$_{0.37}$TaSe$_{2.14}$ ($R\bar3$), Sn$_{0.42}$TaSe$_{2.04}$ ($P\bar31c$), and Sn$_{1.1}$TaSe$_2$ ($Fmm2$). In contrast, powder X-ray diffraction cannot resolve all four structures. Raman spectroscopy is unable to distinguish different structures or compositions in the standard measurement range. Transport measurements show consistent superconductivity irrespective of Sn-intercalation amount or appearance of charge density wave behavior. This work underscores the inadequate sensitivity of common approaches in capturing the structural diversity of intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides and the need for high-resolution structural characterization when examining the properties of van der Waals-layered compounds.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19097v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by M.Atiyah and R.Bott long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>From local to collective superconductivity in proximitized graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting proximity effect induces pairing correlations in metallic systems via Andreev scattering. This effect is particularly intriguing in graphene, as it enables two-dimensional superconductivity that is tunable through doping. Understanding how superconducting correlations propagate within the metal is crucial to unveiling the key factors behind this tunability. Here, we employ scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the energy and length scales of the proximity effect induced by Pb islands on graphene. Using tip-induced manipulation, we assemble S/N/S junctions with tunable N-region spacing and explore the evolution of the proximitized state in the confined normal region. We find that different doping levels can lead to either localized or collective superconducting states. By combining our experimental results with quasiclassical theory, we demonstrate that interface conductance plays a key role in determining the strength and coherence length of pairing correlations and inter-island coupling. Our findings provide new insights into the design of novel superconducting states and the control of their properties.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Fully gapped superconductivity and topological aspects of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor TaReSi"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper [T. Shang et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 224504 (2023)], the authors study the physical properties of TaReSi compounds having Ima2 structure. This noncentrosymmetric structure is proposed to be the source of topological properties for mentioned compound. However, for a correct description of topological features, it is important to recognize the correct structure of the compound at low temperature. In this Comment, we show that Ima2 cannot be realized by TaReSi and is unstable at low temperature. The Ima2 structure contains the soft modes at S (1/2,0,0) point, which leads to the stable structure with Cm symmetry. Notably, the stable Cm system also has a noncentrosymmetric structure, which can be the actual source of topological properties.</description>

      <title>Fermi surface evolution in Weyl semimetal t-PtBi$_2$ probed by transverse transport properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of non-trivial topology and superconductivity opens to novel quantum devices. The discovery of intrinsic materials where such properties appear together represents a frontier in modern condensed matter physics. Trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently emerged as a possible candidate, being the first example of superconducting type-I Weyl semimetal. However, several aspects of this promising compound still need to be unveiled, concerning its complicated band structure, the actual role of Weyl points in determining its electronic properties and the nature of the superconducting transition. In this work, we experimentally investigated a t-PtBi$_2$ single crystal by means of the Hall and Nernst effects. In particular, we revealed a change of regime in its electronic properties, which is compatible with a temperature and magnetic field evolution of hole-like pockets in the Fermi Surface.</description>

      <title>Topological Mixed Valence Model for Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02670v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Song and Bernevig (SB) have recently proposed a topological heavy fermion description of the physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), involving the hybridization of flat band electrons with a relativistic conduction sea. We explore the consequences of this model, seeking a synthesis of understanding drawn from heavy fermion physics and MATBG experiments. We identify a key discrepancy between measured and calculated onsite Coulomb interactions, implicating renormalization effects that are not contained in the current model. With these considerations in mind, we consider an SB model with a single, renormalized onsite interaction between the f-electrons, containing a phenomenological heavy fermion binding potential on the moir\'e AA-sites. This feature allows the simplified model to capture the periodic reset of the chemical potential with filling and the observed stability of local moment behavior. We argue that a two stage Kondo effect will develop in MATBG as a consequence of the relativistic conduction band: Kondo I occurs at high temperatures, establishing a coherent hybridization at the $\Gamma$ points and a non-Fermi liquid of incoherent fermions at the moir\'e K-points; at much low temperatures Kondo II leads to a Fermi liquid in the flat band. Utilizing an auxiliary-rotor approach, we formulate a mean-field treatment of MATBG that captures this physics, describing the evolution of the normal state across a full range of filling factors. By contrasting the relative time-scales of phonons and valence fluctuations in bulk heavy fermion materials with that of MATBG we propose a valley-polaron origin to the Coulomb renormalization and the heavy fermion binding potential identified from experiment. We also discuss the possibility that the two-fluid, non-Fermi liquid physics of the relativistic Kondo lattice is responsible for the strange metal physics observed in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Low temperature phase of AuSn$_{4}$ induced by the van der Waals interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AuSn$_{4}$ is the example of an compound that exhibits topological properties. Recent XRD measurements reveal an ambiguous nature of the crystal structure, as it can be realized with either Aea2 or Ccca symmetry. Motivated by this, we analyze the dynamical stability of the compound. We discuss the role of van der Waals (vdW) corrections within the ab initio calculation. Interestingly, our main result indicates that AuSn$_{4}$ can be unstable with both Aea2 and Ccca symmetries, due to the soft modes in the phonon spectra. From the soft mode analyses we find dynamically stable Pc structure. This structure has always smaller energy than Aea2 or Ccca crystal and it stays independent of the vdW correction. We also show that the comparison of theoretical electronic properties with the experimental ARPES measurements. Our findings may be valuable in the future investigations of AuSn$_{4}$-like compounds.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Weyl Superconductors with Different Pairings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</description>

      <title>Probing the Design Space of InSb Topological Superconductor Nanowires for the Realization of Majorana Zero Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons such as Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have the potential to enable fault-tolerant quantum computing through topological protection. Experimentally reported InSb topological superconductor nanowires (TSNW) are investigated theoretically and numerically to evaluate their suitability to host MZMs. We employ eigenspectra analysis and quantum transport based on the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism to investigate the eigenenergies, Majorana wave functions via local density of states, transmission spectra for Andreev processes, and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in InSb TSNWs. For 1.6 {\mu}m- and 2.2 {\mu}m-long InSb TSNWs we demonstrate the existence of the optimum design space defined by the applied magnetic field and electrochemical potential, which leads to clear ZBCP signatures with a Majorana localization length down to ~340 nm.</description>
