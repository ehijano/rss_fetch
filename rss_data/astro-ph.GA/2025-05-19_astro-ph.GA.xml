      <title>Young stars discovered in dwarf spheroidal galaxies confirm their recent infall into the Milky way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the ESA Gaia satellite and with the ESO VLT, have identified the presence of a population of young, 0.5 to 2 Gyr old, stars in the halo and in dwarf spheroidal galaxies surrounding the Milky Way. It suggests that MW dwarf galaxies, currently devoid of gas, had, until recent times, enough gas to sustain a burst of star formation. The recent loss of gas coincides with their arrival in the vicinity of the Milky Way, in agreement with orbital predictions from Gaia that indicate that most dwarf galaxies reached the Milky Way halo less than 3 Gyr years ago. This completely changes the interpretation of their dynamics, mass, and dark matter content.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the halo occupation distribution in cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The halo occupation distribution is a cornerstone in understanding galaxy formation within the large-scale structure.On the other hand, in the context of the large-scale structure of the Universe, voids are regions with singular characteristics, given their extension, the low number of objects that inhabit their interior and their own dynamics. Furthermore, the HOD of these regions exhibits significant deviations from the average, as shown by several studies in semi-analytical models, hydrodynamic simulations, and observations. This paper investigates the temporal evolution of the HOD in cosmic voids from redshift z = 0.5 to the present day. We aim to understand how the void environment shapes galaxy occupation over time and to identify the factors driving the unique HOD observed in these underdense regions. We use the MDPL2-SAG semi-analytic galaxy catalog and identify spherical cosmic voids at different redshifts. We analyze the HOD within voids across ten simulation snapshots, comparing it with the global HOD. Furthermore, we trace the evolution of z = 0 void galaxies and their host halos back in time, examining their formation times and local density evolution. Our results reveal that the HOD within voids is consistently lower than the average HOD at all redshifts considered. Tracking z = 0 void galaxies, we find that their HOD remains lower than average throughout the redshift range, with no significant redshift evolution in this relative difference. Analysis of halo formation histories shows that lower-mass void halos are younger, while massive void halos are older compared to the average. Spatially, lower-mass halos are found in the inner void regions, whereas massive halos are located closer to void boundaries. The local density of massive void halos decreases significantly towards z = 0, contrasting with the relatively stable local density of lower-mass void halos.</description>

      <title>Dust Evolution in Simulated Multi-phase Galactic Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first large-scale, high-resolution simulations of dusty, star formation feedback-driven galactic outflows. Using the Cholla hydrodynamics code, we investigate dust sputtering in these environments for grains ranging in size from $1-0.001~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$. We compare results for two feedback models: one representative of low-redshift nuclear starburst galaxies and one similar to high-redshift main sequence galaxies. In general, our simulations show that multi-phase outflows are capable of safely transporting a vast majority of their dust to large distances ($\sim10~\textrm{kpc}$) from the disk. This work also shows that environmental shielding in cool gas clouds boosts dust survival rates significantly. The evolutionary path of dust depends strongly on grain size. Large grains ($a\geq0.1~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$) can be transported efficiently in all phases. Smaller grains, however, experience significant destruction in the hotter phases. $0.001~{\mu\mathrm{m}}$ grains in particular are quickly sputtered in all but the coolest gas, resulting in these grains strongly tracing the cool phase in outflows. These results may also indicate the importance of in-situ formation mechanisms, such as shattering, for the small dust grains and PAHs observed in emission throughout outflows in nearby galaxies. Surprisingly, we find that the hot phase dominates the transport of dust that survives to populate the CGM.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Evolution and Spatial Distribution of Multiphase Gas associated with QSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {We investigate the multi-phase gas surrounding QSOs traced by 33 absorption lines (e.g., Ly$\alpha$, C\,\textsc{iv}, Fe\,\textsc{ii}, Mg\,\textsc{ii}, etc.) in the stacked spectra of background sources, using the early data release from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Our analysis reveals that the equivalent width (\( W \)) of metal absorption lines decreases with increasing redshift, following an overall trend described by $W \propto (1+z)^{-4.0\pm 2.2}$. This indicates cosmic enrichment of the gas associated with QSOs, with a more pronounced enrichment observed at larger scales (a few Mpc), reflecting a rapid metal enrichment of cosmic web. Additionally, the \( W \) of these absorption lines decreases with distance ($D$) from QSOs, which can be effectively characterized by a two-halo model. Compared to the projected two point correlation function of galaxies at similar redshifts, low-ionization ions exhibit similar clustering scales, while high-ionization ions show a significantly more extended spatial distribution. We also find that $W_{\text{FeII}}/W_{\text{MgII}}$ increases towards lower redshifts and larger scales, which can be attributed to evolving star formation histories and/or changes in initial mass function for galaxies. By leveraging multiple absorption tracers, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of diffuse, multiphase gas from the circumgalactic medium to cosmological scales, offering new insights into baryon cycles and the transport of metals throughout cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Properties and Velocity Dispersion-Mass Relation of $z \sim 1$ Galaxy Clusters from the GOGREEN and GCLASS Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a sample of 14 galaxy clusters from the GOGREEN and GCLASS (GG) spectroscopic datasets within the redshift range $(0.87 \leq z \leq 1.37)$ and cluster masses $\mathrm{M}_{200} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{14}$ \hm. Using the highly effective GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment developed by our own team, we derive the dynamical parameters of these clusters through the virial mass estimator. We examine the velocity dispersion-cluster mass relation $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ for the GG cluster sample. We find, $\log{\sigma_{200}} = (2.94\pm0.02) + (0.37\pm0.07)\log{\mathrm{M}_{200}}$ with an intrinsic scatter of $(\sigma_\mathrm{int} = 0.02 \pm 0.02)$. Our results demonstrate that the $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ relation is consistent with predictions from cosmological simulations, highlighting the reliability of the GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment. Furthermore, the $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ validates the robustness of the virial mass estimator in accurately recovering cluster masses and associated parameters. Importantly, our findings confirm that velocity dispersion can be used directly to estimate cluster mass without relying on dynamical mass estimators.</description>

      <title>The dust emissivity index beta in infrared-bright galaxies at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 4.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have measured the dust emissivity index beta for 21 infrared-bright sources (including several gravitationally lensed galaxies) at 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 4.2 using Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 101-199 GHz data sampling the Rayleigh-Jeans side of the SED. These data are largely insensitive to temperature variations and therefore should provide robust measurements of beta. We obtain a mean beta of 2.2 with a standard deviation of 0.6 that is at the high end of the range of values that had previously been measured in many galactic and extragalactic sources. We find no systematic variation in beta versus redshift. We also demonstrate with a subset of our sources that these higher beta values have significant implications for modelling dust emission and in particular for calculating dust masses or the wavelength at which dust becomes optically thick.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Ionized and Neutral ISM at z &gt; 10 : The Origin of [O III] /[C II] Ratios from a Sub-parsec Resolution Radiative Transfer Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations by JWST and ALMA are unveiling both ionized and neutral ISM components in high-redshift ($z&gt;6$) galaxies. In this work, we investigate the origin of rest-frame far-infrared [OIII]88 $\mu$m and [CII]158 $\mu$m emission by performing zoom-in cosmological simulations of dwarf-galaxy progenitors at $z=9-13$. Our simulations incorporate on-the-fly radiative transfer at sub-pc ($\sim$ 0.1 pc) resolution, allowing us to resolve the multi-phase ISM. We compute emission lines on a cell-by-cell basis, taking into account local temperature, density, metallicity, radiation field strength, column density, and spectral hardness of radiation bins. We find that [OIII] predominantly arises from centrally located ionizing bubbles with temperatures of $\sim (1-5)\times 10^4\,\mathrm{K}$ and high ionization parameters of $\log U_{\mathrm{ion}} \simeq -1.5$. In contrast, [CII] is produced in the surrounding dense neutral regions at $\sim 5\times 10^3\,\mathrm{K}$, which are heated by strong FUV radiation from the central stellar clusters. This spatial arrangement leads to large local variations in [OIII]/[CII], ranging from $\sim$ 100 to 0.01. Our galaxy reproduces the global ratio [OIII]/[CII]$\sim5-30$, consistent with recent ALMA detections at $z&gt;6$ without invoking enhanced O/C abundance ratios. We further derive that [OIII]/[CII] linearly scales with the mass and density ratios of ionized to neutral gas, $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ and $n_{\rm HII}/n_{\rm HI}$ and show that the [OIII]/[CII] ratio typically changes from 5.7 to 0.3 from high-z to low-z. For future synergies of JWST and ALMA, we derived $M_{\rm HII}/M_{\rm HI}$ for observed $z &gt;6$ galaxies using ${\rm H}\beta$ and [CII] and show the validity of our scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Connecting JWST discovered N/O-enhanced galaxies to globular clusters: Evidence from chemical imprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have revealed a growing population of galaxies at $z&gt;4$ with elevated nitrogen-to-oxygen ratios. These "N/O-enhanced" galaxies (NOEGs) exhibit near- to super-solar N/O at sub-solar O/H, clearly deviating from the well-established scaling relation between N/O and O/H observed in local galaxies. The origin of this abundance anomaly is unclear. Interestingly, local globular clusters also exhibit anomalous light-element abundances, whose origin remains debated. In this work, we compare the chemical abundance patterns of 22 known NOEGs at $0\lesssim z\lesssim 12$ -- primarily discovered with JWST -- to those observed in local globular clusters. We find striking similarities in the abundances of C, N, O, Fe, and He between the two populations. The similar abundance patterns support the scenario in which globular cluster stars formed within proto-cluster environments -- similar to those traced by NOEGs -- that were self-enriched. Indeed, the enhancement in N/O in early galaxies appears to be only found in dense stellar environments with $\Sigma _{\star}\gtrsim 10^{2.5}~M_\odot~{\rm pc^{-2}}$, as expected for the progenitors of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and similar to those of star clusters identified in strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies. Furthermore, we find a tentative positive correlation between N/O ratios and stellar mass among NOEGs. The apparent high occurrence rate of NOEGs at high redshift is consistent with the picture of cluster-dominated star formation during the early stages of galaxy evolution. Measuring chemical abundances across diverse stellar environments in high-redshift galaxies will be crucial for elucidating the connection between NOEGs and globular clusters.</description>

      <title>First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES) -- XIX: Supermassive black hole mergers in the early Universe and their environmental dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatory, LISA, is expected to detect GW signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) mergers occurring at high redshifts. However, understanding the origin and growth of SMBHs in the early Universe remains an open problem in astrophysics. In this work, we utilize the First Light And Reionization Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, to study SMBH mergers at $5 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ across a wide range of environments. Most mergers in FLARES involve secondary SMBHs near the seed mass ($m_{seed} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$) while primary SMBHs span up to $10^{9} M_{\odot}$, resulting in mass ratios from $q \sim 10^{-4}$ to $1$, with a peak at $q \sim 1$. The number of mergers increases rapidly towards lower redshifts, and the comoving total number density scales with overdensity as $n_{merger} = 10^{-3.80} (1 + \delta)^{4.56}$. Denser regions host more massive mergers, with higher merger redshifts and lower mass ratios. Within the FLARES redshift range, LISA is expected to detect mergers with $10^{5} \lesssim M_{tot} / M_{\odot} \lesssim 10^{8}$ and $q \gtrsim 10^{-2}$, corresponding to a detection rate of 0.030 $yr^{-1}$ for events with signal-to-noise ratio $SNR \geq 10$. Our study demonstrates the sensitivity of GW predictions at high redshifts to SMBH seed models and merger time delays, highlighting the need for improved modeling in future cosmological simulations to maximize LISA's scientific return.</description>

      <title>High-Velocity Molecular Clouds in M83</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs), which are gas clouds moving at high velocity relative to the galactic disk, may play a critical role in galaxy evolution, potentially supplying gas to the disk and triggering star formation. In this study, we focus on the nearby face-on barred spiral galaxy M83, where high spatial resolution, high-sensitivity CO (1-0) data are available. We identified molecular clouds and searched for clouds with velocities deviating by more than 50km/s from the disk velocity field as HVCs. A total of 10 HVCs were detected -- nine redshifted and one blueshifted -- clearly highlighting an asymmetry in their velocity distribution. These HVCs have radii of 30-80 pc, masses on the order of $10^5 M_\odot$, and velocity dispersions of 3-20 km/s, displaying a tendency toward higher velocity dispersion compared to disk molecular clouds in M83. Most of the HVCs do not overlap with the candidates of supernova remnants, and the energy needed to drive HVCs at such high velocities exceeds single supernova energy. Together with the asymmetry in their velocity distribution, we thus conclude that most of the HVCs found in this study are inflow from outside the M83's disk.</description>

      <title>Low-Metallicity Star Formation Survey in Sh2-284 (LZ-STAR). II. The inital mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To fully understand the star formation process, we are compelled to study it in a variety of environments. Of particular interest are how star formation and the resulting initial mass function (IMF) vary as a function of metallicity. We have observed an embedded young cluster in Sh2-284 (hereafter S284), the HII region associated with the open cluster Dolidze 25 using JWST/NIRCam with the aim to study star formation in a metal-poor, i.e., about 1/3 of solar, environment. In particular, we aim to measure the peak of the IMF. Using JWST NIRCam photometry, we identified the embedded cluster S284-EC1 and resolved its low-mass content. By comparison with pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks we determine the mass and extinction for the individual cluster members. Extinction limited samples are created based on the distribution of extinction and the completeness of the data. For the region with a completeness of 50% or higher, we have fitted a log-normal distribution to the IMF. Adopting a fiducial age of 1 Myr of the members, the peak of the IMF is found to be at mc = 0.16+-0.02Msun, which is significantly smaller than the peak mass measured in local young clusters, such as mc = 0.26+0.11-0.07 Msun in the Orion Nebula Cluster (Gennaro &amp; Robberto 2020), or the local Galactic disk value of mc = 0.25 Msun (Chabrier 2005). We have found evidence for IMF variation as a function of metallicity, i.e., the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses as one goes from solar to 1/3 solar metallicity. However, we caution that the result is sensitive to the assumed age of the stellar population, i.e., with peak mass rising if an age older than 1 Myr is adopted. This study further motivates the need for expanded samples of low-metallicity regions and their content to enable more comprehensive measures of the IMF in such environments.</description>

      <title>The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at $4\lesssim z\lesssim7$ drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (\textsc{GalfitS}) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are $\sim 0.3$~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous ``blue'' quasars ($L_{5100}\gtrsim10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies ($n \approx 5$) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median $\beta_{\rm UV} \approx -1.4$), while fainter ``red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts ($n\approx 1$) and display a broad range of slopes ($\beta_{\rm UV}\approx-2$ to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\ast = 1.2\%$ compared to $4.7\%$ for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively $\sim$0.6~dex above the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\ast$ relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Modelling the evolution and influence of dust in cosmological simulations that include the cold phase of the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While marginal in mass terms, dust grains play an outsized role in both the physics and observation of the interstellar medium (ISM). However, explicit modelling of this ISM constituent remains uncommon in large cosmological simulations. In this work, we present a model for the life-cycle of dust in the ISM that couples to the forthcoming COLIBRE galaxy formation model, which explicitly simulates the cold ISM. We follow 6 distinct grain types: 3 chemical species, including carbon and two silicate grains, with 2 size bins each. Our dust model accounts for seeding of grains from stellar ejecta, self-consistent element-by-element metal yields and depletion, grain size transfer and destruction of dust in the ISM. We detail the calibration of this model, particularly the use of a clumping factor, to account for unresolved gas clouds in which dust readily evolves. We present a fiducial run in a 25$^3$~cMpc$^3$ cosmological volume that displays good agreement with observations of the cosmic evolution of dust density, as well as the $z=0$ galaxy dust mass function and dust scaling relations. We highlight known tensions between observational datasets of the dust-to-gas ratio as a function of metallicity depending on which metallicity calibrator is used; our model favours higher-normalisation metallicity calibrators, which agree with the observations within 0.1~dex for stellar masses $&gt;10^9 \; {\rm M_\odot}$. We compare the grain size distribution to observations of local galaxies, and find that our simulation suggests a higher concentration of small grains, associated with more diffuse ISM and the warm-neutral medium (WNM), which both play a key role in boosting H$_2$ content. Putting these results and modelling approaches in context, we set the stage for upcoming insights into the dusty ISM of galaxies using the COLIBRE simulations.</description>

      <title>The Star Formation and Chemical Evolution Histories of Ursa Minor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution history (CEH) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). We detect two distinct stellar populations that exist over 6 times half-light radius from its center. The results are obtained by applying a newly developed algorithm to the deep and wide-field photometric dataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The algorithm employs the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing to minimize a $\chi^{2}$ value between the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and synthetic CMD generated from the stellar isochrones. The age and metallicity resolutions are set to $0.5$ Gyr and $0.1$ dex, respectively. The accuracy assessment with mock galaxies shows that it returns the peaks of metallicity distributions and star formation period within 1 $\sigma$ of input value in the case of a single population. In tests with two populations, two distinct metallicity peaks are identified without an offset from the input values, indicating the robustness of this algorithm. The detected two populations in the UMi dSph have the metallicity peaks of [Fe/H] = $-2.2$ and $-2.5$; the metal-rich population started its star formation about 1 Gyr later than the metal-poor one. The SFH of both metal-rich and metal-poor populations varies with distance from the center of the UMi dSph, without any age-gradients. These results suggest that the UMi dSph underwent a complex formation process, contrary to the simple formation history of dwarf galaxies previously thought.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved stellar populations and emission lines properties in nearby galaxies with J-PLUS -- I. Method and first results for the M101 group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved maps of stellar populations and nebular emission are key tools for understanding the physical properties and evolutionary stages of galaxies. We aim to characterize the spatially resolved stellar population and emission line properties of galaxies in the M101 group using Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) data. The datacubes first go through pre-processing steps, which include masking, noise suppression, PSF homogenization, and spatial binning. The improved data are then analyzed with the spectral synthesis code \alstar, which has been previously shown to produce excellent results with the unique 12 bands filter system of J-PLUS and S-PLUS. We produce maps of stellar mass surface density ($\Sigma_\star$), mean stellar age and metallicity, star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), dust attenuation, and emission line properties such as fluxes and equivalent widths of the main optical lines. Relations among these properties are explored. All galaxies exhibit a well-defined age-$\Sigma_\star$ relation, except for the dwarfs. Similarly, all of the galaxies follow local $\Sigma_\star$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ star-forming MS relations, with specific star formation rates that grow for less massive systems. A stellar $\Sigma_\star$-metallicity relation is clearly present in M101, while other galaxies have either flatter or undefined relations. Nebular metallicities correlate with $\Sigma_\star$ for all galaxies. This study demonstrates the ability of J-PLUS to perform IFS-like analysis of galaxies, offering robust spatially resolved measurements of stellar populations and emission lines over large fields of view. The M101 group analysis showcases the potential for expanding such studies to other groups and clusters, contributing to the understanding of galaxy evolution across different environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement and carbon nanodots: A conceptual view for the origin of diffuse interstellar bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the Diffuse Interstellar Band (DIB) carriers is perhaps the most studied, longest standing, unresolved problem in astronomy. While four bands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority (&gt; 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual framework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the origin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these transitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on excitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic basis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with the energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon nanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These preliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in nanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and intervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is that predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at most, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two bands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate, depending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the size dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario for the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a single DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests that a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and exciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful. This work also hints at the requirement for stable configurations for particular size domains in order to explain DIB wavelength stability.</description>

      <title>ALMA observation of evolving magnetized corona in the radio-quiet changing-state AGN NGC 1566</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of compact millimeter (mm) continuum emission from radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs) is still not fully understood. Changing-state AGNs (CSAGNs) display rapid and strong variability, which can allow us to investigate the origin of the mm emission. We present here the results of the first study of the mm continuum variability of a CSAGN using archival ALMA band 6 ($\sim 230$ GHz) observations of NGC 1566 obtained in 2014-2023. We find a positive correlation between the mm and X-ray flux with an intrinsic scatter of 0.05 dex ($1\sigma$), suggesting a common origin. The mm spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm mm}$) is found in the range of $0.13\pm0.38$ to $-0.26\pm0.53$, consistent with a compact optically thick synchrotron source. No significant correlation was found between the $\alpha_{\rm mm}$ and the mm flux. The mm/X-ray ratio also shows no clear link to the Eddington ratio but is higher in the low-accretion state. We discuss several scenarios about the origin of the mm emission in NGC 1566. We find that synchrotron emission in the magnetized X-ray corona appears to be the most probable origin of mm emission, confirming that mm emission can be used as a tracer of AGN activity in RQAGNs.</description>

      <title>Radio continuum spectra of SFGs in the XMM-LSS Field below-threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the radio spectral properties of \textit{K}$_{S}$-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the XMM-LSS field using extensive multiwavelength data. By employing various diagnostics, SFGs are distinguished from quiescent galaxies and AGN across seven redshift bins ($\rm{0.1\leq\,\textit{z}\,\leq\,3.0}$). The broadband radio frequency spectral energy distribution is analysed at observer-frame frequencies from 144 to 1500 MHz using median stacking techniques correcting for median flux boosting. We investigate the relationship between the radio spectral index, $\alpha$ (where $S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) and redshift ($z$). Our analysis reveals no significant inverse correlation between $\alpha$ and $z$, indicating that the radio spectrum remains independent with varying redshift. We fit the stacked median radio SEDs with a power law (\textit{PL}), curved power law (\textit{CPL}) and double power law (\textit{DPL}) models. For the \textit{DPL} and \textit{CPL} models, we observe a consistent steepening of the low-frequency spectral index across all redshift bins. For the \textit{CPL} model, the curvature term $q$ is greater than zero in all redshift bins. Model comparisons indicate that spectra are generally well fitted by all the models considered. At 1500 MHz, SFGs display both a steep synchrotron component and a flat free-free emission component, with a thermal fraction consistently around 11$\%$ to 18$\%$. Further deep radio observations, with higher resolution to better deal with source blending and confusion noise and wider frequency coverage to better separate non-thermal and thermal radio emission, are required to reveal the detailed physical processes, thus clarifying the nature of radio sources.</description>

      <title>Gamma Analytical Modeling Evolution (GAME) I: The physical implications of deriving the stellar mass functions from z=0 to z=8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\Gamma$ growth model is an effective parameterization employed across various scientific disciplines and scales to depict growth. It has been demonstrated that the cosmic star formation rate density (CSFRD) can also be described broadly by this pattern, i.e. $\frac{dM(T)}{dT} = M_{z,0}\, \times \frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \, T^{\alpha-1} e^{-\beta \, T }$ M$_{\odot}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, where $M_{z,0}$ is the stellar mass at $z$ = 0, $\alpha = 3.0$, $\beta = 0.5 $ Gyr$^{-1}$ and $T$ describes time. We use the identical $\Gamma$ growth pattern given by the CSFRD to extend the present day (z = 0) stellar mass bins $M_{\ast}(T)$ of the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) and investigate if we are able to reproduce observations for the high redshift GSMFs. Surprisingly, our scheme describes successfully the evolution of the GSMF over 13.5 Gyrs, especially for objects with intermediate and low masses. We observe some deviations that manifest {\it solely} at very high redshifts ($z &gt; 1.5$, i.e. more than 9.5 Gyr ago) and {\it specifically} for very small and exceedingly massive objects. We discuss the possible solutions (e.g. impacts of mergers) for these offsets. Our formalism suggests that the evolution of the GSMF is set by simple (few parameters) and physically motivated arguments. The parameters $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are theoretically consistent within a multi-scale context and are determined from the dynamical time scale ($\beta$) and the radial distribution of the accreting matter ($\alpha$). We demonstrate that both our formalism and state-of-the-art simulations are consistent with recent GSMFs derived from JWST data at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXV. A potential new molecular outflow in [BHB2007] 11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the early stages of star formation, accretion processes such as infall from the envelope and molecular streamers, and ejection of matter through winds and jets take place simultaneously. The Class 0/I binary [BHB2007] 11 shows evidence for accretion and ejection at the scales of the circumbinary disk and the inner close binary. Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated structures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO outflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of verifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within the Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities close to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent with outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO outflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is $(1.8\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}M_{\odot}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those measured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars. The SiO image reveals compact emission close to the binary system, with a slight elongation aligned with the larger-scale structures. This suggests that SiO is released from the sputtering of dust grains in the shocked material at the base of the potential new outflow, with a relative abundance of $\geq(0.11-2.0)\times10^{-9}$. However, higher angular and spectral resolution observations are needed to accurately estimate the outflow launching radius and its powering source. Given the location and the abundance of the SiO emission, we propose that the second outflow may be launched from inside the circumbinary disk, likely by the less massive companion, which is actively accreting material from its surroundings.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>A luminous and hot infrared through X-ray transient at a 5 kpc offset from a dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are searching for hot, constant-color, offset optical flares in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data stream that are ${&gt;}10''$ from any galaxy in public imaging data from the PanSTARRS survey. Here, we present the first discovery from this search: AT 2024puz, a luminous multiwavelength transient offset by $5\,$kpc from a ${\sim}10^8\,M_\odot$ galaxy at $z=0.356$ with a low-moderate star formation rate. It produced luminous $10^{44.79 \pm 0.04}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ optical/UV emission that evolved on a ${\sim}20\,$day timescale, as well as $10^{44.12\pm0.03}\,{\rm erg\,s}^{-1}$ X-ray emission with a photon-index $\Gamma=1.7$. No associated radio or millimeter emission was detected. We show that the early-time optical emission is likely powered by reprocessing of high-energy, accretion-powered radiation, with a possible contribution from a shock in a dense circum-transient medium. If the shock is dominant at early-times, the circum-transient medium has a mass ${\sim}0.1-1\,M_\odot$, radius $10^{15}\,$cm, and a density profile shallower than ${\sim}r^{-1}$. A near-infrared excess appears at late-times and is suggestive of reprocessing within a wind or other circum-transient medium. The X-rays are most consistent with a central engine. We suggest that AT 2024puz may be associated with an accretion event onto a $50-10^5\,M_\odot$ BH, where the lower masses are preferred based on the large projected offset from the host galaxy. AT2024puz exhibits properties similar to both luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), but is intermediate between them in its energetics and evolution timescale. This highlights the need for broader exploration of the landscape of hot optical transients to trace their origins.</description>

Abstract: Solar-type members of the rich, nearly Solar-age and Solar-metallicity M67 open cluster are systematically investigated for ultraviolet variability. We utilize archival Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) data which features several imaging observation epochs spanning 5 years. Stars in or suspected of being in binary systems are avoided as well as stars that are blended in GALEX data, leading to a sample of 66 Solar-type stars. We assess variability over a variety of timescales that probe flares and longer-term trends that could be due to rotation and activity cycles. We do not find conclusive evidence for variability and determine that Solar-type members of M67 do not display &gt;30% near-ultraviolet variability over timescales ranging from days to years. Furthermore, within 50-second cadence lightcurves generated for each of the imaging epochs we find no near-ultraviolet flares that are &gt;~2x the quiescent stellar near-ultraviolet emission level; the implied ultraviolet flare rate derived from this study is in mild tension with that derived for stars observed by GALEX in the primary Kepler field. This M67 GALEX study presents one of the most comprehensive ultraviolet datasets currently available for probing continuum emission variability for old Sun-like stars; the planned NASA UVEX mission has the potential to dramatically expand upon this work.</description>

      <title>Carbon-rich dust injected into the interstellar medium by Galactic WC binaries survives for hundreds of years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet stars (WC stars) show an infrared excess from dust emission. Dust forms in the collision of the WC wind with a companion star's wind. As this dust is carried towards the ISM at close to the WCd wind speed and the binary continues through its orbit, a spiral structure forms around the system. The shape depends on the orbital eccentricity and period, as well as stellar parameters like mass-loss rates and terminal wind speeds. Imaging of the WCd binary WR 140 with JWST/MIRI revealed at least 17 concentric dust shells surrounding the binary. We present new JWST imaging of four additional WCd systems (WR 48a, WR 112, WR 125, and WR 137) that were imaged in 2024. In this analysis, we show that the dust is long-lived, surviving for at least 130 years, but more than 300 years in some systems. Longer duration measurements are limited by sensitivity. Regular spacing of dust features confirms the periodic nature of dust formation, consistent with a connection to binary motion. We use these images to estimate the proper motion of the dust, finding the dust to propagate out to the interstellar medium with motion comparable to the wind speed of the WC stars. In addition to these results, we observe unusual structures around WR 48a, which could represent dusty clumps shaped by photoevaporation and wind ablation like young proplyd objects. These results demonstrate that WC dust is indeed long-lived and should be accounted for in galactic dust budgets.</description>

      <title>Idealized Global Models of Accretion Disks with Strong Toroidal Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of accretion disks with a strong toroidal magnetic field using an equation of state that fixes the gas thermal scale height. The disk forms from the inflow of a rotating magnetized gas cloud with a toroidal magnetic field. We find that the system maintains a moderately strong mean azimuthal field in the midplane, with plasma-$\beta\sim1$, trans-Alfv\'enic fluctuations, and large accretion stresses $\alpha\sim0.1$. The azimuthal field in the disk is continuously escaping along the vertical direction but is also replenished via a local dynamo. The inflowing gas initially forms a strongly magnetized Keplerian disk with $\beta\ll1$ and $\alpha \gg 1$. The disk gradually collapses from the inside out over $\sim 50-80$ orbits to form a moderately magnetized disk with $\beta\sim1$ and $\alpha\sim0.1$. Radial advection of azimuthal magnetic field can maintain $\beta\lesssim1$ exterior to the circularization radius but not inside of it. Inclusion of a net initial vertical magnetic field can lead to an even more strongly magnetized disk midplane, consistent with previous work. When the gas thermal scale is not resolved ($\lesssim 4$ cells per thermal scale height), however, the disk remains highly magnetized with $\beta \ll 1 $. We discuss our results in the context of related shearing box simulations and other global disk simulations. The level of angular momentum transport found here is consistent with that inferred observationally in dwarf novae and X-ray transient outbursts, unlike simulations of weakly magnetized accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Evidence that Mass Loss on the Red Giant Branch Decreases with Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mass loss on the red giant branch (RGB) influences stellar evolution, properties of stellar populations, and Galactic chemical enrichment, yet remains poorly constrained observationally. Current models provide limited insight into how stellar properties, particularly how metallicity and mass, affects RGB mass loss. Here, I introduce a new observational approach that uses the age-velocity-dispersion relation and the lower-mass boundary of red giants as precise evolutionary markers. These markers, informed by Galactic evolution, allow us to construct observational isochrones for field stars. By comparing masses of RGB stars and red clump (RC) stars at the same age in the Kepler sample, I derive empirical measurements of integrated RGB mass loss at several points in age and metallicity. Combining these new observational measurements with open-cluster studies, I showed that the integrated mass loss on the RGB decreases with metallicity, and may also decrease with stellar mass. The average mass loss rate, which accounts for RGB lifetimes and the initial mass differences between RGB and RC stars at the same age, also show a similar trend. These findings challenge current mass-loss prescriptions widely adopted in stellar evolutionary models, since none of them is able to produce the observed mass-loss trend without widely adjusting free parameters. This highlights an urgent need to revise mechanisms that govern RGB mass loss.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Fraction in Disk-Like Galaxies Over the Past 10 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an observational study of the dark matter fraction in star-forming disk-like galaxies up to redshift $z \sim 2.5$, selected from publicly available integral field spectroscopic surveys: KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$, KGES, and KROSS. To model the $H\alpha$ kinematics of these galaxies, we employ 3D forward-modelling, which incorporates beam-smearing and inclination corrections, and yields rotation curves. Subsequently, these rotation curves are corrected for gas pressure gradients, resulting in circular velocity curves or `intrinsic' rotation curves. Our final sample comprises of 263 rotationally supported main sequence star-forming galaxies with redshifts ranging from $0.6 \leq z &lt; 2.5$. We estimate the dark matter fraction of these galaxies by subtracting the baryonic mass from the total mass, where the total mass is derived from the intrinsic rotation curves. We provide novel observational evidence, suggesting that at a fixed redshift, the dark matter fraction gradually increases with radius such that the outskirts of galaxies are dark matter dominated, similarly to local star-forming disk galaxies. This observed dark matter fraction exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing redshift and, on average, the fraction within the effective radius (upto outskirts) remains above 50\%, similar to locals. We investigate the relationships between dark matter, baryon surface density, and circular velocity of galaxies. We observe that low stellar mass galaxies, with $\log(M_{\rm star}\ [\mathrm{M_\odot}]) \leq 10.0$, undergo a higher degree of evolution, which may be attributed to the hierarchical merging of galaxies. Most importantly, we discuss several sources of uncertainties and current limitations in the field, as well as their impact on the measurements of dark matter fraction and its trend across galactic scales and cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Resolving the nature and putative nebular emission of GS9422: an obscured AGN without exotic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the sources that power nebular emission in high-redshift galaxies is fundamentally important not only for shedding light onto the drivers of reionisation, but to constrain stellar populations and the growth of black holes. Here we focus on an individual object, GS9422, a galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=5.943$ with exquisite data from the JADES, JEMS and FRESCO surveys, including 14-band JWST/NIRCam photometry and deep NIRSpec prism and grating spectroscopy. We map the continuum emission and nebular emission lines across the galaxy on 0.2-kpc scales. GS9422 has been claimed to have nebular-dominated continuum and an extreme stellar population with top-heavy initial mass function. We find clear evidence for different morphologies in the emission lines, the rest-UV and rest-optical continuum emission, demonstrating that the full continuum cannot be dominated by nebular emission. While multiple models reproduce the spectrum reasonably well, our preferred model with a type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and local damped Ly-$\alpha$ (DLA) clouds can explain both the spectrum and the wavelength-dependent morphology. The AGN powers the off-planar nebular emission, giving rise to the Balmer jump and the emission lines, including Ly-$\alpha$, which therefore does not suffer DLA absorption. A central, young stellar component dominates the rest-UV emission and -- together with the DLA clouds -- leads to a spectral turn-over. A disc-like, older stellar component explains the flattened morphology in the rest-optical continuum. We conclude that GS9422 is consistent with being a normal galaxy with an obscured, type-2 AGN -- a simple scenario, without the need for exotic stellar populations.</description>

      <title>All-Sky Kinematics of the Distant Halo: The Reflex Response to the LMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infall of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is predicted to displace the inner Milky Way (MW), imprinting an apparent 'reflex motion' on the observed velocities of distant halo stars. We construct the largest all-sky spectroscopic dataset of luminous red giant stars from $50-160$ kpc, including a new survey of the southern celestial hemisphere. We fit the full 6D kinematics of our data to measure the amplitude and direction of the inner MW's motion towards the outer halo. The observed velocity grows with distance such that, relative to halo stars at $100$ kpc, the inner MW is lurching at $\approx 40$ km s$^{-1}$ towards a recent location along the LMC's past orbit. Our measurements align with N-body simulations of the halo's response to a $1.8 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$ LMC on first infall, suggesting that the LMC is at least 15% as massive as the MW. Our findings highlight the dramatic disequilibrium of the MW outskirts, and will enable more accurate measurements of the total mass of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Morpho-Photometric Classification of KiDS DR5 Sources Based on Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Star-Quasar-Galaxy Catalog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel multimodal neural network (MNN) for classifying astronomical sources in multiband ground-based observations, from optical to near infrared, to separate sources in stars, galaxies and quasars. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network branch for learning morphological features from $r$-band images with an artificial neural network branch for extracting spectral energy distribution (SED) information. Specifically, we have used 9-band optical ($ugri$) and NIR ($ZYHJK_s$) data from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 5. The two branches of the network are concatenated and feed into fully-connected layers for final classification. We train the network on a spectroscopically confirmed sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey cross-matched with KiDS. The trained model achieves 98.76\% overall accuracy on an independent testing dataset, with F1 scores exceeding 95\% for each class. Raising the output probability threshold, we obtain higher purity at the cost of a lower completeness. We have also validated the network using external catalogs cross-matched with KiDS, correctly classifying 99.74\% of a pure star sample selected from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and 99.74\% of an external galaxy sample from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, adjusted for low-redshift contamination. We apply the trained network to 27,335,836 KiDS DR5 sources with $r \leqslant 23$ mag to generate a new classification catalog. This MNN successfully leverages both morphological and SED information to enable efficient and robust classification of stars, quasars, and galaxies in large photometric surveys.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Dark Matter Halo Properties on the Morphology of Their Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07525v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Xu \&amp; Jing reported a monotonic relationship between host halo mass $M_h$ and the morphology of massive central galaxies, characterized by the S\'ersic index $n$, at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that morphology could serve as a good secondary proxy for halo mass. Since their results were derived using the indirect abundance matching method, we further investigate the connection between halo properties and central galaxy morphology using weak gravitational lensing. We apply galaxy-galaxy lensing to measure the excess surface density around CMASS central galaxies with stellar masses in the range of $11.3 &lt; \log M_*/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 11.7$, using the HSC shear catalog processed through the Fourier\_Quad pipeline. By dividing the sample based on $n$, we confirm a positive correlation between $n$ and $M_h$, and observe a possible evidence of the positive correlation of $n$ and halo concentration. After accounting for color, we find that neither color nor morphology alone can determine halo mass, suggesting that a combination of both may serve as a better secondary proxy. In comparison to hydrodynamic simulations, we find that TNG300 produce much weaker correlations between $M_h$ and $n$. Furthermore, using SIMBA simulations with different feedback mode, we find jet-mode active galactic nuclei feedback might be related to the relationship of S\'ersic index and halo mass.</description>

      <title>Constraining the major merger history of $z \sim 3-9$ galaxies using JADES: dominant in-situ star formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of galaxy close-pair fractions and major merger rates to evaluate the importance of mergers in the hierarchical growth of galaxies over cosmic time. This study focuses on the previously poorly understood redshift range of $z \approx 3-9$ using JADES observations. Our mass-complete sample includes primary galaxies with stellar masses of ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8, 10]$, having major companions (mass ratio $\geq 1/4$) selected by $5-30$ pkpc projected separation and redshift proximity criteria. Pair fractions are measured using a statistically robust method incorporating photometric redshift posteriors and available spectroscopic data. The pair fraction evolves with redshift and shows dependence on the stellar mass: at ${\rm log}(M_\star/{\rm M_\odot}) = [8.0, 8.5]$ there is an increase up to $z\sim5-6$, followed by a turnover; while at higher stellar masses there is a flattening and weak decline with increasing redshift. Similarly, the derived galaxy major merger rate increases and flattens beyond $z \sim 6$ to $2-8~{\rm Gyr^{-1}}$ per galaxy, showing a weak scaling with stellar mass, driven by the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function. A comparison between the cumulative mass accretion from major mergers and the mass assembled through star formation indicates that major mergers contribute approximately $3-13\%$ to the total mass growth over the studied redshift range, which is in agreement with the ex-situ mass fraction estimated from our simple numerical model. These results highlight that major mergers contribute little to the direct stellar mass growth compared to in-situ star formation but could still play an indirect role by driving star formation itself.</description>

      <title>Low-Acceleration Gravitational Anomaly from Bayesian 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: Methodology and Results with Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated wide binary stars provide natural laboratories to directly probe gravity for Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$. Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have been performed only with sky-projected relative velocities $v_p$ in the pairs. A new method of Bayesian orbit modeling exploiting three relative velocity components including the radial component $v_r$ is developed to measure the gravitational anomaly parameter $\Gamma\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma_g}\equiv\log_{10}\sqrt{G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}}$ where $G_{\rm{eff}}$ is the effective gravitational constant for pseudo-Newtonian elliptical orbits, while $G_{\rm{N}}$ is Newton's constant. The method infers individual probability distributions of $\Gamma$ and then combines the independent distributions to obtain a consolidated distribution in a specific range of $g_{\rm{N}}$. Here the method is described and applied to a sample of 312 wide binaries in a broad dynamic range $10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$ with $v_r$ uncertainties in the range $168&lt;\sigma_{v_r}&lt;380$ m s$^{-1}$ selected from the Gaia DR3 database. The following results are obtained: $\Gamma = 0.000\pm 0.011$ ($N_{\rm{binary}}=125$) for the high-acceleration regime ($10^{-7.9} \lesssim g_{\rm{N}} \lesssim 10^{-6.7}$ m s$^{-2}$) agreeing well with Newton, but $\Gamma = 0.085\pm 0.040$ or $\gamma_g=1.48_{-0.23}^{+0.33}$ (35) for a MOND regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) and $\Gamma = 0.063\pm 0.015$ or $\gamma_g=1.34_{-0.08}^{+0.10}$ (111) for a MOND+transition regime ($10^{-11.0}\lesssim g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-8.5}$ m s$^{-2}$). These results show that a gravitational anomaly is evident for $g_{\rm{N}}\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ and $\Gamma$ in the MOND regime ($\lesssim 10^{-9.5}$ m s$^{-2}$) agrees with the prediction ($\approx 0.07$) of MOND gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved Alma Band-9 observations of the [CII] 158 $\mu$m fine structure line from an optically selected quasar, SDSS J100038.01+020822.4 (J1000), at z=1.8275. By utilizing [OI] 63 $\mu$m line observations from Herschel/PACS and constructing a detailed dust SED using Herschel and Spitzer archival imaging data, we show that the [CII] line emission is well explained by a photodissociation region (PDR) model, in which the emission arises from the surfaces of molecular clouds exposed to far-UV radiation fields $\sim 5\cdot10^3$ times the local interstellar radiation field (G$_0$). We find a factor of 30 variation in spatially resolved [CII]/Far-IR continuum across the source which is explained by the reduced fraction of cooling via [CII] line emission at such high far-UV field strengths. By matching derived PDR parameters to the observed far-IR line and continuum intensities we derive cloud size-scales and find that typical cloud radii in J1000 are $\sim$3.5 pc perhaps indicating an ISM that is highly fractured due to intense star formation activity. We model the galaxy dynamically and find that the [CII] emission is contained within a compact, dynamically cold disk with v/$\sigma$=6.2, consistent with cosmological simulations. We also report the discovery of a companion galaxy to j1000 confirmed by the detection of [CII] and use recently obtained JWST/NirCAM imaging of the system to argue for J1000 being an interacting system. With total stellar mass $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and main-component dynamical mass $\gtrsim 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$, the J1000 system is a progenitor to the most massive galaxies seen in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Nearby stellar substructures in the Galactic halo from DESI Milky Way Survey Year 1 Data Release</title>

Abstract: We report five nearby ($d_{\mathrm{helio}} &lt; 5$ kpc) stellar substructures in the Galactic halo from a subset of 138,661 stars in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Milky Way Survey Year 1 Data Release. With an unsupervised clustering algorithm, HDBSCAN*, these substructures are independently identified in Integrals of Motion ($E_{\mathrm{tot}}$, $L_{\mathrm z}$, $\log{J_r}$, $\log{J_z}$) space and Galactocentric cylindrical velocity space ($V_{R}$, $V_{\phi}$, $V_{z}$). We associate all identified clusters with known nearby substructures (Helmi streams, M18-Cand10/MMH-1, Sequoia, Antaeus, and ED-2) previously reported in various studies. With metallicities precisely measured by DESI, we confirm that the Helmi streams, M18-Cand10, and ED-2 are chemically distinct from local halo stars. We have characterised the chemodynamic properties of each dynamic group, including their metallicity dispersions, to associate them with their progenitor types (globular cluster or dwarf galaxy). Our approach for searching substructures with HDBSCAN* reliably detects real substructures in the Galactic halo, suggesting that applying the same method can lead to the discovery of new substructures in future DESI data. With more stars from future DESI data releases and improved astrometry from the upcoming Gaia Data Release 4, we will have a more detailed blueprint of the Galactic halo, offering a significant improvement in our understanding of the formation and evolutionary history of the Milky Way Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Mass Modeling the Andromeda Dwarf Galaxies: Andromeda VI and Andromeda XXIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately mapping the mass profiles of low mass dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies allows us to test predictions made by dark matter (DM) models. To date, such analyses have primarily been performed on Milky Way (MW) satellites. Meanwhile, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is home to 35 known dwarf galaxies, yet only two have been successfully mass-modeled so far. A more comprehensive study of Local Group dwarfs is necessary to better understand the nature of dark matter. In this study, we have undertaken a dynamical study of two higher-luminosity Andromeda dwarf galaxies: Andromeda VI (And VI) and Andromeda XXIII (And XXIII). We infer an enclosed mass for And VI of M(r $&lt;$ r$_{h}$) = (4.9 $\pm$ 1.5) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]_{r_{\rm{h}}}$ = (27.1 $\pm$ 8.2) M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$. We infer an enclosed mass for And XXIII of M(r $&lt;$ r$_{h}$) = (3.1 $\pm$ 1.9) $\times$ 10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$, corresponding to a mass-to-light ratio of $[M/L]_{r_{\rm{h}}}$ = (90.2 $\pm$ 53.9) M$_{\odot}$/L$_{\odot}$. Using the dynamical Jeans modeling tool, \gravsphere, we determine And VI and And XXIII's dark matter density at 150 pc, finding $\rho_{\rm{DM,VI}}$(150 pc) = (1.4 $\pm$ 0.5) $\times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$ and $\rho_{\rm{DM,XXIII}}$(150 pc) = 0.5$\substack{+0.4 \\ -0.3} \times 10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ kpc$^{-3}$. Our results make And VI the first mass-modeled M31 satellite to fall into the cuspy regime. And XXIII has a lower density, implying either a more cored central dark matter density, or a lowering of the density through tides. This adds And XXIII to a growing list of M31 dwarfs with a central density lower than most MW dwarfs and lower than expected for isolated dwarfs in the Standard Cosmology. This could be explained by the M31 dwarfs having experienced stronger tides than their MW counterparts.</description>

      <title>Search for dwarf galaxies in the southwestern sector of the Local cosmic void</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed a search for new dwarf galaxies in a direction towards the southwestern part of the Local Void using the data on DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. In a sky area of $\sim1000$ square degrees, we discovered 12 candidates to nearby dwarfs with a high confidence. Four of them are probable new companions to the nearby galaxy M 83 and others are isolated objects. We found also 20 nearby dwarf candidates with a low confidence. Almost all of the detected galaxies are classified as late type dwarfs. A new cluster of bluish stars with an angular diameter of 0.9$^{\prime}$ is revealed by us at a high galactic latitude, $b = -29^{\circ}$. Being at a distance of $\sim70$ kpc, it can be a globular cluster associated with the Milky Way stellar stream Sagittarius dSph or a new ultra-faint satellite of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Back from the dead: AT2019aalc as a candidate repeating TDE in an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. We aim to classify the transient and explain the mechanism responsible for its second optical flare. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023/2024. Results. The observations revealed a uniquely bright UV counterpart and multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conclusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. The multi-wavelength properties of these transients suggest a possible connection between ECLEs, BFFs and TDEs in AGN.</description>

      <title>Blinded Mock Data Challenge for Gravitational-Wave Cosmology-I: Assessing the Robustness of Methods Using Binary Black Holes Mass Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) sources are standard sirens that provide an independent way to map the cosmic expansion history by combining with an independent redshift measurement either from an electromagnetic counterpart for a bright siren or using different statistical techniques for dark sirens. In this analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge (\texttt{Blinded-MDC}) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble constant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass distribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different analysis setups for the \texttt{Blinded-MDC} to test both statistical and systematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$ with detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs matches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline can recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution. However, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population depends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the data, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by about $1.5\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a limited number of events. In the future, elaborate studies will be required to mitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical complexities. This MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy of standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness of the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.</description>

      <title>Forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling from interstellar medium heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In interstellar media characterized by a nonrelativistic plasma of electrons and heavy ions, we study the effect of axion dark matter coupled to photons on the dynamics of an electric field. In particular, we assume the presence of a background magnetic field aligned in a specific direction. We show that there is an energy transfer from the oscillating axion field to photons and then to the plasma induced by forced resonance. This resonance is most prominent for the axion mass $m_{\phi}$ equivalent to the plasma frequency $\omega_p$. Requiring that the heating rate of the interstellar medium caused by the energy transfer does not exceed the observed astrophysical cooling rate, we place forecast constraints on the axion-photon coupling $g$ for several different amplitudes of the background magnetic field $B_0$. By choosing a typical value $B_0=10^{-6}$ G, we find that, for the resonance mass $m_{\phi}=\omega_p$, the upper limit of $g$ can be stronger than those derived from other measurements in the literature. With increased values of $B_0$, it is possible to put more stringent constraints on $g$ for a wider range of the axion mass away from the resonance point.</description>

      <title>Detecting Exomoons in Free-Floating-Planet Events from Space-based Microlensing Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a planet is ejected from its star-planet system due to dynamical interactions, its satellite may remain gravitationally bound to the planet. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) will be capable of detecting a large number of low-mass free-floating planet events (FFPs) from a bulge microlensing survey. We assess the feasibility of detecting satellites (a.k.a., exomoons) orbiting FFPs by simulating CSST light curves and calculating the detection efficiency as a function of satellite-to-planet mass ratios (q) and projected separations (s) in units of the Einstein radius. For a Neptune-class FFP in the Galactic disk with a Sun-like star as the microlensed source, CSST can detect Earth-mass satellites over a decade of separations (from ~0.01 to ~0.1 AU) and has sensitivity down to Moon-mass satellites (q~1e-3) at s~1. CSST also has some sensitivity to detect Moon-mass satellites at s~2 (~0.02 AU) orbiting an Earth-mass FFP in the disk. CSST has substantially reduced sensitivity for detecting satellites when the source star is an M dwarf, compared to a Sun-like source. We also calculate the satellite detection efficiency for the dedicated microlensing survey of the Roman Space Telescope (Roman), which demonstrates greater sensitivity than CSST, particularly for M-dwarf sources. Notably, some of the Neptune-Earth systems detectable by CSST and Roman may exhibit significant tidal heating.</description>

      <title>Non-halo structures and their effects on gravitationally lensed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the $\Lambda$CDM model succeeds on large scales, its validity on smaller scales remains uncertain. Recent works suggest that non-halo dark matter structures, such as filaments and walls, could significantly influence gravitational lensing and that the importance of these effects depends on the dark matter model: in warm dark matter scenarios, fewer low-mass objects form and thus their mass is redistributed into the cosmic-web. We investigate these effects on galaxy-galaxy lensing using fragmentation-free Warm Dark Matter (WDM) simulations with particle masses of m$_{\chi}$ = 1 keV and m$_{\chi}$ = 3 keV. Although these cosmological scenarios are already observationally excluded, the fraction of mass falling outside of haloes grows with the thermal velocity of the dark matter particles, which allows for the search for first-order effects. We create mock datasets, based on gravitationally-lensed systems from the BELLS-Gallery, incorporating non-halo contributions from these simulations to study their impact in comparison to mocks where the lens has a smooth mass distribution. Using Bayesian modelling, we find that perturbations from WDM non-halo structures produce an effect on the inferred parameters of the main lens and shift the reconstructed source position. However, these variations are subtle and are effectively absorbed by standard elliptical power-law lens models, making them challenging to distinguish from intrinsic lensing features. Most importantly, non-halo perturbation does not appear as a strong external shear term, which is commonly used in gravitational lensing analyses to represent large-scale perturbations. Our results demonstrate that while non-halo structures can affect the lensing analysis, the overall impact remains indistinguishable from variations of the main lens in colder WDM and CDM scenarios, where non-halo contributions are smaller.</description>

      <title>Testing the local void hypothesis using baryon acoustic oscillation measurements over the last twenty years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A promising solution to the Hubble tension is a local void that is roughly 20% underdense out to 300 Mpc, as suggested by galaxy number counts in the near-infrared. Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate redshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by Haslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of available BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality and quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically averaged distance $D_{\mathrm{V}}$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in the homogeneous model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a discrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift. Assuming independent uncertainties, the 42 considered $D_{\mathrm{V}}$ observations give a total $\chi^2$ of 75.7 for the void-free model, while the void models give only $47.3 - 51.2$ depending on the density profile. This represents a reduction in overall tension from $3.3\sigma$ without a void to $1.1\sigma - 1.4\sigma$ in the void models. The $\chi^2$ differences are smaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift depth. The void-free model provides the worst fit in almost every case. Overall, our results suggest that recent evidence of BAO observables deviating from expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local void, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>OGLE-2002-BLG-360: a dusty anomaly among red nova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OGLE-2002-BLG-360 is an example of a Galactic red nova, the aftermath of a non-compact stellar merger. The dusty nature of the circumstellar environment makes observations of this particular source difficult, meaning the properties of the central star and its surrounding environment are poorly understood. We aim to establish the parameters of the merger remnant, as well as of the dusty environment and its structure. We attempt to establish similarities with other Galactic red novae and try to understand how such an environment has been formed. We use optical, infrared, and sub-millimetre observations to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) between 2 um and 1.27 mm for an epoch 15-21 years after the red nova eruption. We use the RADMC-3D radiative transfer code to model the SED and retrieve the physical properties of both the central star and the surrounding dust. We show that the SED is best replicated by a spherically symmetric model consisting of an M-type supergiant surrounded by 0.012 Msun of dust concentrated within two spherical shells. The dust extends out to a maximum distance of 9500 AU from the central source, whilst the inner shell extends out to 1000 AU. The dust composition is dominated by iron grains (58%), but also contains olivine silicates (25%) and alumina dust (17%), which are both required to reproduce the profile of the observed 10 um absorption feature. The inner shell likely originates from merger and post-merger ejecta, whilst the outer shell consists of material lost much earlier, before the merger event occurred. Evolution of the SED indicates continued dust formation within the expanding inner shell, which may be analogous to winds of red supergiants. The object is extremely dusty compared to other red nova remnants.</description>

Abstract: Subhaloes are critical in distinguishing dark matter models, yet their evolution within galactic haloes, particularly in the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) model, remains challenging to fully investigate in numerical simulations. In this work, we employ the fluid-wave hybrid scheme recently implemented in the GAMER-2 code to perform a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-sized halo with an FDM particle mass of m = 2 x 10^(-23) eV. It simultaneously resolves the solitonic core of the host halo and tracks the complex tidal evolution of subhaloes down to redshift z = 0. We examine the internal structure of subhaloes by analyzing their density profiles, velocity dispersions, and density power spectra across various redshifts. Our findings show that partially tidally stripped subhaloes deviate from the core-halo mass relation; their solitons remain intact and are enveloped by smaller granules predominantly from the host halo. Furthermore, our simulation unravels a complex tidal evolution of FDM subhaloes. On the one hand, we observe a subhalo core undergoing complete tidal disruption at z ~ 0.14, which later reemerges near the outskirts of the host halo around z ~ 0. This disruption event, characterized by a core contaminated with interference fringes from the host halo's wave function, occurs earlier than previously predicted. On the other hand, FDM subhaloes have denser cores before infall due to the presence of central solitons, making them more resilient to tidal disruption than their N-body counterparts. Our results demonstrate GAMER-2's capability to resolve non-linear FDM substructure down to z = 0, paving the way for future studies of larger FDM subhalo samples with heavier particle masses.

Abstract: Stars orbiting supermassive black holes can generate recurring accretion flares in repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we develop an efficient formalism for analyzing the time-dependent response of a star to the removal of a fraction ($\lesssim 10\%$) of its mass. This model predicts that mass loss results in a decrease in the average density of low-mass ($\lesssim 0.7 M_{\odot}$) stars. Contrarily, higher-mass stars exhibit an increase in their average density, such that the change is more pronounced for larger mass losses, and stars with masses $\sim 1.5-2 M_{\odot}$ experience the largest such increase. We predict that the final energy of the star post-mass-loss (i.e., the ``surviving core'') is effectively given by the binding energy of the original star interior to the radius from which mass is removed, i.e., the final core energy is agnostic to the process that removes the mass and -- as a corollary -- tidal heating is comparatively insignificant. We find excellent agreement between our predictions and one-dimensional Eulerian simulations of a star undergoing mass loss, and three-dimensional Lagrangian simulations of partial TDEs. We conclude that 1) partially disrupted stars are not significantly heated via tidal dissipation, 2) evolved and moderately massive ($\gtrsim 1.5 M_{\odot}$) stars can most readily survive many repeated stripping events, and 3) progressively dimmer flares -- observed in some repeating partial TDE candidates -- could be explained by the increase in the density of the star post-mass-loss.</description>
