      <title>Enhanced and Tunable Superconductivity Enabled by Mechanically Stable Halogen-Functionalized Mo2C MXenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and superconducting properties of halogen-functionalized Mo2YX2 (Y = C, N; X = F, Cl, Br, I) MXene monolayers. Density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory calculations reveal that, among the halogenated systems considered, only Br- and I-functionalized Mo2C monolayers are dynamically stable, as confirmed by positive definite phonon spectra throughout the Brillouin zone. Electronic structure calculations show metallic behavior with states near the Fermi level dominated by Mo d orbitals with pronounced electronic density of states, providing favorable conditions for strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC). The resulting EPC constants place both systems in the strong coupling regime, yielding superconducting transition temperatures of Tc = 13.1 K for Mo2CBr2 and Tc = 18.1 K for Mo2CI2 within the Allen-Dynes formalism. Notably, halogen functionalization itself plays a crucial role in enhancing superconductivity in Mo2C, which has Tc = 7.2 K, leading to a substantial increase in the superconducting transition temperature compared with pristine Mo2C through strengthened electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that superconductivity in these systems is highly tunable via carrier doping and biaxial tensile strain. Electron doping significantly enhances EPC and raises Tc up to 21.7 K for Mo2CBr2 and 21.3 K for Mo2CI2. Our results identify halogen-functionalized Mo2C MXenes as mechanically robust, phonon mediated two dimensional superconductors and highlight carrier doping as an effective strategy for optimizing their superconducting performance.</description>

      <title>Charge density wave and superconductivity modulated by c-axis stacking in the TaSe2 polytypes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered transition metal dichalcogenide, TaSe2, exhibits rich electronic phenomena across its polymorphs, 1T, 2H, and 3R, largely driven by differences in atomic coordination and c-axis stacking. In the 1T phase, octahedral coordination and AA stacking promote strong interlayer coupling and stabilize a commensurate charge density wave (CDW) with star-of-David clusters that set in at high temperatures. The 2H phase exhibits trigonal prismatic coordination with AB stacking, and hosts both incommensurate and commensurate CDW phases and weak superconductivity at very low temperatures. The 3R phase, characterized by ABC stacking and trigonal prismatic coordination, exhibits enhanced superconductivity along with CDW order, attributed to modified interlayer hybridization and reduced CDW competition. These stacking-dependent variations in interlayer coupling are critical in tuning correlated states in the dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Quantum-geometric thermal conductivity of superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory with isolated bands to an external gravitomagnetic vector potential via a gravitomagnetic Peierls substitution, we identify a quantum-geometric contribution to the electronic contribution of the thermal conductivity. This contribution is governed by the quantum metric in the parameter space spanned by the components of the external gravitomagnetic vector potential which corresponds to a weighted quantum metric in momentum space. In the flat-band limit, we establish an upper and lower Wiedemann-Franz-type bound for the ratio of thermal Meissner stiffness and electric Meissner stiffness (superfluid weight), whose prefactors are provided by the extrema of the squared energy offsets of the outer single-particle bands of the system. Similarly to the superfluid weight, this also leads to a lower bound of the thermal Meissner stiffness in terms of the Chern number. Our results apply to both superconductors and other fermionic superfluids.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Error-Correction Code Encoders in Superconducting Electronic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data transmission from superconducting electronic circuits, such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic, to room-temperature electronics is susceptible to bit errors, which may result from flux trapping, fabrication defects, and process parameter variations (PPV). Due to the cooling power budget at 4.2 K and constraints on the chip area, the size of the error-correction code encoders is limited. In this work, three lightweight error-correction code encoders are proposed that are based on Hamming(7,4), Hamming(8,4), and Reed-Muller(1,3) codes and implemented with SFQ logic. The performance of these encoders is analyzed in the presence of PPV. The trade-offs between the theoretical complexity and physical size of error-correction code encoders are identified.</description>

      <title>Sondheimer magneto-oscillations as a probe of Fermi surface reconstruction in underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the Fermi surface (FS) volume in underdoped cuprates is crucial for understanding the nature of the strongly correlated pseudogap phase. Conventional quantum oscillation techniques, typically used for this purpose, are inapplicable in this high-temperature regime due to thermal and disorder-induced smearing of Landau levels. We propose Sondheimer oscillations (SO), semiclassical oscillations of in-plane magnetoresistivity in thin films, as a robust alternative probe of FS reconstruction. SO arise from the commensuration between the cyclotron radius and film thickness, do not rely on Landau quantization, and remain observable at moderate fields and elevated temperatures where quantum oscillations are suppressed. Their frequencies depend solely on the FS parameters (e.g., curvature), and not on specific details of scattering mechanisms. SO are also sensitive to the coherence of inter-layer tunneling, allow contributions from individual FS pockets to be distinguished in the frequency domain, and naturally include the Yamaji angle effect (if present in the system) as a prominent feature in the frequency spectrum. We compute SO spectra as a function of the magnetic field orientation for three representative scenarios: (i) an unreconstructed large FS, (ii) a spin density wave reconstructed FS with volume $p/4$, and (iii) a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL$^*$) with pocket volume $p/8$ (here $p$ is the hole doping). We show that the SO spectrum offers a wealth of universal features that could be used to differentiate between these scenarios. In particular, we highlight a FS geometry-dependent phase shift between oscillations in longitudinal and transverse conductivities, characterize how the FS curvature can be extracted from SO if the film orientation is perpendicular to the crystallographic $c$-axis, and analyze the evolution of the SO spectrum with doping.</description>

      <title>Metastable Dynamical Computing with Energy Landscapes: A Primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smartphones, laptops, and data centers are CMOS-based technologies that ushered our world into the information age of the 21st century. Despite their advantages for scalable computing, their implementations come with surprisingly large energetic costs. This challenge has revitalized scientific and engineering interest in energy-efficient information-processing designs. One current paradigm -- dynamical computing -- controls the location and shape of minima in potential energy landscapes that are connected to a thermal environment. The landscape supports distinguishable metastable energy minima that serve as a system's mesoscopic memory states. Information is represented by microstate distributions. Dynamically manipulating the memory states then corresponds to information processing. This framing provides a natural description of the associated thermodynamic transformations and required resources. Appealing to bifurcation theory, a computational protocol in the metastable regime can be analyzed by tracking the evolution of fixed points in the state space. We illustrate the paradigm's capabilities by performing 1-bit and 2-bit computations with double-well and quadruple-well potentials, respectively. These illustrate how dynamical computing can serve as a basis for designing universal logic gates and investigating their out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid and Weyl superconductivity from the weakly interacting 3D electron gas at high magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional electron gases in strong magnetic fields host partially flat bands that disperse along the field direction yet exhibit Landau-level quantization in the transverse dimensions. Early work established that for spin-polarized electrons confined to the lowest Landau level band, repulsion triggers a charge density wave (CDW) in which electrons 'self-layer' into integer quantum Hall states, while attraction generates a non-Fermi liquid (rather than a superconductor). We revisit this problem with physically motivated deformations -- including generalized local interactions, higher Landau level bands, restoration of spin, and explicit breaking of spatial symmetries -- paying particular attention to the competition between CDWs and superconductivity. Our main findings are: (1) Generic local interactions can stabilize a nematic CDW in which integer quantum Hall layers spontaneously 'tilt', yielding unconventional Hall response. (2) We numerically establish that the non-Fermi liquid appears stable to perturbations that preserve effective dipole conservation symmetries that emerge within a Landau level band. (3) Upon explicitly breaking translation symmetry, attraction catalyzes a novel layered superconductor that hosts Weyl nodes, superconducts within each layer, and insulates transverse to the layers. These results expand the rich phenomenology of interacting bulk electrons in the high-field regime and potentially inform the design of field-resistant superconductivity in low-carrier-density materials.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram in a magnetic field with baryon and isospin chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the chiral perturbation theory at the leading order, we present the phase diagram of low-energy QCD in a magnetic field at finite baryon and isospin chemical potentials. The phase diagram consists of the QCD vacuum, the chiral soliton lattice, the uniform charged pion condensation, an Abrikosov vortex lattice of the charged pions, a baryonic vortex lattice composed of neutral and charged pion vortices with their topological linking number being the baryon number, and a hybrid phase of chiral soliton and vortex lattices, with their intersections carrying the baryon number. While the chiral soliton lattice demands ultra-strong magnetic field $\sim 10^{19}$ G,the intersection phase appears at $\sim10^{17}$ G, which is more realistic in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Kagome edge states under lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the edge state properties of a two-dimensional kagome lattice using a tight-binding approach, focusing on the role of lattice termination, spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic order. In the pristine limit, we show that the existence of localized edge states is highly sensitive to boundary geometry, with certain terminations completely suppressing edge modes. Kane-Mele spin-orbit coupling opens a bulk gap and stabilizes topologically protected helical edge states, yielding a robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ insulating phase that is insensitive to termination details. In contrast, the combined effect of a Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit coupling drives the system into Chern insulating phases, with Chern numbers consistent with the number of chiral edge modes. We further demonstrate that non-coplanar magnetic textures generate multiple Chern phases through finite scalar spin chirality, with Kane-Mele coupling strongly tuning the topological gaps. Our results provide important insights into the tunability of edge states in the kagome lattice, which can be key to designing materials with novel electronic properties and topological phases.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in overdoped cuprates can be understood from a BCS perspective!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25767v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We summarize key experimental studies of the low energy properties of overdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors and conclude that a theoretical understanding of the ``essential physics" is achievable in terms of a conventional Fermi-liquid treatment of the normal state, and a BCS mean-field treatment of the (d-wave) superconducting state. For this perspective to be consistent, it is necessary to posit that there is a crossover from a strongly correlated underdoped regime (where a different theoretical perspective is necessary) to the more weakly correlated overdoped regime. It is also necessary to argue that the various observed features of the overdoped materials that are inconsistent with this perspective can be attributed to the expected effects of the intrinsic disorder associated with most of the materials being solid state solutions (alloys). As a test of this idea, we make a series of falsifiable predictions concerning the expected behavior of an ``ideal" (disorder free) overdoped cuprate.</description>

      <title>Paramagnon-Interference Mechanism for Three-Dimensional Bond Order in Kagome Metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K): Analysis by the Density-Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of CDW and its 3D structure are important fundamental issues in kagome metals. We have previously shown that, based on a 2D model, $2\times 2$ bond order (BO) emerges due to the paramagnon-interference (PMI) mechanism and that its fluctuations lead to $s$-wave superconductivity. This paper studies these issues based on realistic 3D models of kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=Cs, Rb, K). We reveal that a commensurate 3D $2\times 2\times 2$ BO is caused by the PMI mechanism, by performing the 3D density-wave (DW) equation analysis for all A=Cs, Rb, K models in detail. Our results indicate a BO transition temperature $T_{\rm BO}\sim 100$K within the regime of moderate electron correlation. The 3D structure of BO is attributed to the three-dimensionality of the Fermi surface, while the 3D structure of BO is sensitively changed, since the Fermi surface is quasi-2D. Based on the analysis of the DW equation, by taking into account a finite third-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) term, (i) shift stacking $2\times 2\times 2$ BO can be realized via a first-order transition below $T_{\rm BO}$. Here, the in-plane BO pattern (tri-hexagonal or star-of-David) is determined by the sign of the third-order GL term, with hole doping tending to favor the tri-hexagonal state. On the other hand, if the third-order GL term is very small, (ii) alternating vertical stacking BO may instead be realized via a second-order transition. The present study enhances our understanding of the rich variety of BOs observed experimentally. It is confirmed that the PMI mechanism is the essential origin of the 3D CDW of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary gauge quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general framework for the quantisation of light-matter theories with time-dependent holonomic constraints. Unless time dependence is present from the outset at the Lagrangian level, different gauges generally produce non-equivalent canonical theories. The irrotational gauge is defined as that which also yields a correct theory when time dependence is introduced at the Hamiltonian level. Our framework unifies examples of such gauges found in existing literature. In particular, we show that for describing time-dependent light-matter interactions the Coulomb gauge is not generally irrotational, so it does not enjoy any special status.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics predicts that unobserved systems may exist in a superposition of states, yet measurement produces definite outcomes, a tension at the heart of the quantum-to-classical boundary. How the transformation between these opposing regimes unfolds as observation strength increases has remained experimentally unexplored. Here, by continuously tuning the measurement strength on a superconducting qubit, we reveal that measurement-dominated dynamics emerge not gradually but through three distinct transitions: coherent oscillations abruptly halt; the system then freezes near a stable quantum state; and finally enters the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger observation paradoxically slows relaxation. Decoherence, rather than washing out this structure, reorganizes it, inverting the order in which transitions appear and decoupling signatures that coincide in idealized models. These results establish that the route from quantum dynamics to measurement-dominated behavior unfolds in sharp transitions governed by the interplay between observation and environment.</description>

Using a generalized master equation based on real-time diagrammatics and full counting statistics, we compute the steady-state current, zero-frequency noise, and rate of entropy production in the large superconducting-gap limit. We show how Coulomb interactions modify Andreev-mediated transport by renormalizing resonant conditions and suppressing superconducting coherence, leading to a pronounced reduction of current precision even when average currents are only weakly affected. These effects are particularly evident at high temperatures, where conventional Coulomb-blockade features are thermally smeared while fluctuation properties remain highly sensitive. By analyzing thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we demonstrate that violations of the quantum bound present in the noninteracting regime are progressively reduced and eventually suppressed as interactions increase, whereas the recently proposed hybrid bound remains satisfied. Our results clarify how Coulomb interactions, and nonequilibrium fluctuations jointly determine transport properties in hybrid superconducting devices, and establish current precision as a robust benchmark for interacting Andreev transport beyond the noninteracting limit.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting quantum devices, from qubits and magnetometers to dark matter detectors, are influenced by magnetic flux noise originating from paramagnetic surface defects and impurities. These spin systems can feature complex dynamics, including a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition, that depend on the lattice, interactions, external fields, and disorder. However, the disorder included in typical models is not materials-specific, diminishing the ability to accurately capture measured flux noise phenomena. We present a first principles-based simulation of a spin lattice consisting of paramagnetic O$_2$ molecules on an Al$_2$O$_3$ surface, a likely flux noise source in superconducting qubits, to elucidate opportunities to mitigate flux noise. We simulate an ensemble of surface adsorbates with disordered orientations and calculate the orientation-dependent exchange couplings using density functional theory. Thus, our spin simulation has no free parameters or assumed functional form of the disorder, and captures correlation in the defect landscape that would appear in real systems. We calculate a range of exchange interactions between electron pairs, with the smallest values, 0.016 meV and -0.023 meV, being in the range required to act as a two-level system and couple to GHz resonators. We calculate the flux noise frequency, temperature, and applied external magnetic field dependence, as well as the susceptibility-flux noise cross-correlation. Calculated trends agree with experiment, demonstrating that a surface harboring paramagnetic adsorbates arranged with materials-specific disorder and interactions captures the various properties of magnetic flux noise observed in superconducting circuits. In addition, we find that an external electric field can tune the spin-spin interaction strength and reduce magnetic flux noise.</description>

      <title>Properties of Bose-Einstein condensates with altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a weakly interacting two-component Bose--Einstein condensate in the miscible regime in the presence of \emph{altermagnetism}, i.e., a collinear and globally compensated magnetic order that breaks spin-rotation symmetry while maintaining zero net magnetization. Within Bogoliubov theory, we derive the quasiparticle spectrum and coherence factors and show that altermagnetic order generically induces an angular dependence of the low-energy excitations. As a result, the sound velocity, momentum-resolved magnetization in the quantum depletion, and density--spin response functions acquire anisotropic components. We show that these anisotropic contributions vanish after angular averaging, consistent with the defining feature of altermagnetism: nontrivial local spin polarization without a global magnetization. Finally, we evaluate the Lee--Huang--Yang correction to the ground-state energy in the altermagnetic phase. Our results should be testable with ultracold-atom experiments in the foreseeable future.</description>
