      <title>Metric Linear Orders and O-Minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuous logic, there are plenty of examples of interesting stable metric structures. However, on the other side of the SOP line, there are only a few metric structures where order is relevant, and orders often appear in different ways. We now present a unified approach to linear and cyclic orders in continuous logic. We axiomatize theories of metric linear and cyclic orders, and in the ultrametric case, find generic completions, analogous to the complete theory DLO. We then characterize which expansions of metric linear orders should be considered o-minimal in terms of regulated functions. We prove versions several key properties of o-minimal structures, such as definable completeness and distality, in the context of o-minimal metric structures. Finally we find examples of o-minimal (and weakly o-minimal) metric structures by turning to real closed metric valued fields.</description>

      <title>General real-valued theories with the Schr\"oder-Bernstein property are stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every general theory \`a la Keisler with the Schr\"oder-Bernstein property is stable. This generalizes the corresponding result from classical logic due to John Goodrick. Our proof uses the classical result (generalized to the case that the instability is witnessed by an infinitary formula) together with a discretization technique introduced by Keisler and the third-named author. We speculate on how our techniques could be adapted to show that every continuous theory with the Schr\"oder-Bernstein property is stable.</description>

      <title>Constructing crowded Hausdorff $P$-spaces in set theory without the axiom of choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an infinite set $X$, a closed under finite unions family $\mathcal{Z}$ with $[X]^{&lt;\omega}\subseteq\mathcal{Z}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$, and any $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(X)$, the topology $\tau_{\mathcal{A}}[\mathcal{Z}]=\{V\in\mathcal{A}: (\forall x\in V)(\exists z\in \mathcal{Z})(x\cap z=\emptyset \wedge \{y\in\mathcal{A}: x\subseteq y\subseteq X\setminus z\}\subseteq V)\}$ on $\mathcal{A}$ is investigated to give answers to the following open problem in various models of $\mathbf{ZF}$ or $\mathbf{ZFA}$: Is there a non-empty Hausdorff, crowded zero-dimensional $P$-space in the absence of the axiom of choice? Spaces of the form $\mathbf{S}(X, [X]^{\leq\omega})=\langle \mathcal{A}, \tau_{\mathcal{A}}[\mathcal{Z}]\rangle$ for $\mathcal{A}=[X]^{&lt;\omega}$ and $\mathcal{Z}=[X]^{\leq\omega}$ are of special importance here. Among many other results, the following theorems are proved in $\mathbf{ZF}$: (1) If $X$ is uncountable, then $\mathbf{S}(X, [X]^{\leq\omega})$ is a crowded zero-dimensional Hausdorff space, and if $X$ is also quasi Dedekind-finite, then $\mathbf{S}(X, [X]^{\leq\omega})$ is a $P$-space; (2) $\mathbf{S}(\omega_1, [\omega_1]^{\leq\omega})$ is a $P$-space if and only if $\omega_1$ is regular; (3) the axiom of countable choice for families of finite sets is equivalent to the statement ``for every infinite Dedekind-finite set $X$, $\mathbf{S}(X,[X]^{\leq\omega})$ is a $P$-space''; (4) the statement ``$\mathbb{R}$ admits a topology $\tau$ such that $\langle\mathbb{R}, \tau\rangle$ is a crowded, zero-dimensional Hausdorff $P$-space'' is strictly weaker than the axiom of countable choice for families of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$; (5) the statement ``there exists a non-empty, well-orderable crowded zero-dimensional Hausdorff $P$-space'' is strictly weaker than ``$\omega_1$ is regular''. A lot of relevant independence results are obtained.</description>

      <title>On the quadratic complexity of subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prior work, we showed that subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of $\mathrm{VC_{2}}$-dimension at most $k$ are well approximated by a union of atoms of a quadratic factor of complexity $(\ell,q)$, where the complexity $\ell$ of the linear part and the complexity $q$ of the quadratic part are both bounded in terms of $k$, $p$, and the desired level of approximation $\mu$. A key tool in the proof of this result was an arithmetic regularity lemma for the Gowers $U^3$-norm by Green and Tao, which resulted in tower-type bounds (in terms of $\mu^{-1}$) on both $\ell$ and $q$.
  In the present paper we show that for sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension, the bound on $q$ can be substantially improved. Specifically, we will prove that any set $A\subseteq G=\mathbb{F}_p^n$ of $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension at most $k$ is approximately equal (up to error $\mu |G|$) to a union of atoms of a quadratic factor whose quadratic complexity is at most $\log_p(\mu^{-k-o(1)})$, implying that the purely quadratic component of the factor partitions the group into $\mu^{-k-o(1)}$ many parts.
  We achieve this by using our earlier result to obtain an initial quadratic factor $\mathcal{B}$, and then applying a generalization of an argument of Alon, Fox and Zhao for subsets of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{n}$ of bounded $\mathrm{VC}$-dimension to the label space (also known as "configuration space") of $\mathcal{B}$. A related strategy was employed in earlier work of the authors on $\mathrm{NFOP}_2$ subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, and in work of the first author in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Measurable domatic partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a compact Polish group of finite topological dimension. For a countably infinite subset $S\subseteq \Gamma$, a domatic $\aleph_0$-partition (for its Schreier graph on $\Gamma$) is a partial function $f:\Gamma\rightharpoonup\mathbb{N}$ such that for every $x\in \Gamma$, one has $f[S\cdot x]=\mathbb{N}$. We show that a continuous domatic $\aleph_0$-partition exists, if and only if a Baire measurable domatic $\aleph_0$-partition exists, if and only if the topological closure of $S$ is uncountable. A Haar measurable domatic $\aleph_0$-partition exists for all choices of $S$. We also investigate domatic partitions in the general descriptive graph combinatorial setting.</description>

      <title>Duality Theory for Bounded Lattices: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are numerous generalizations of the celebrated Priestley duality for bounded distributive lattices to the non-distributive setting. The resulting dualities rely on an earlier foundational work of such authors as Nachbin, Birkhoff-Frink, Bruns-Lakser, Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka, and others. We undertake a detailed comparative study of the existing dualities for arbitrary bounded (non-distributive) lattices, including supplying the dual description of bounded lattice homomorphisms where it was lacking. This is achieved by working with relations instead of functions. As a result, we arrive at a landscape of categories that provide various generalizations of the category of Priestley spaces. We provide explicit descriptions of the functors yielding equivalences of these categories, together with explicit equivalences with the category of bounded lattices and bounded lattice homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Provability Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a new Kripke-style semantics for classical modal logic, named as provability models. We study provability models for the propositional modal logics K, K4, S4 GL, GLP and the interpretability logic ILM. Provability models combine features of Kripke models with the assignment of logics to individual worlds. Originally introduced in [Mojtahedi, 2022], these models allowed the first author to establish arithmetical completeness for intuitionistic provability logic. Interestingly, we show that the ILM is complete for the same provability models of GL. We improve provability models to predicative and decidable provability models in the case of GL and ILM. Furthermore, we prove a soundness and completeness of GLP for provability models.</description>

      <title>Higher-order generalizations of stability and arithmetic regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a natural notion of higher order stability and show that subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ that are tame in this sense can be approximately described by a union of low-complexity quadratic varieties, up to linear error. This generalizes the arithmetic regularity lemma for stable subsets of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$, proved in earlier work of the authors, to the realm of higher-order Fourier analysis.
  This result is strictly stronger than the structure theorem for sets of bounded $\mathrm{VC}_2$-dimension, first proved by the authors in earlier versions of this paper and now available as a separate manuscript. Taken together, these results provide group theoretic analogues of results obtained for 3-uniform hypergraphs in arXiv:2111.01737.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing small varieties of periodic l-pregroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an axiomatization for the variety generated by the $n$-periodic l-pregroup $\mathbf{F}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, for every $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, as well as for all possible joins of such varieties; the finite joins form an ideal in the subvariety lattice of l-pregroups and we describe fully its lattice structure. On the way, we characterize all finitely subdirectly irreducible (FSI) algebras in the variety generated by $\mathbf{F}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ as the $n$-periodic l-pregroups that have a totally ordered group skeleton (and are not trivial). The finitely generated FSIs that are not l-groups are further characterized as lexicographic products of a (finitely generated) totally ordered abelian l-group and $\mathbf{F}_k(\mathbb{Z})$, where $k \mid n$.</description>
