      <title>Self-Reinforced Deep Priors for Reparameterized Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) has become a widely adopted technique for high-resolution subsurface imaging. However, its inherent strong nonlinearity often results in convergence toward local minima. Recently, deep image prior-based reparameterized FWI (DIP-FWI) has been proposed to alleviate the dependence on massive training data. By exploiting the spectral bias and implicit regularization in the neural network architecture, DIP-FWI can effectively avoid local minima and reconstruct more geologically plausible velocity models. Nevertheless, existing DIP-FWI typically use a fixed random input throughout the inversion process, which fails to utilize the mapping and correlation between the input and output of the network. Moreover, under complex geological conditions, the lack of informative prior in the input can exacerbate the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, leading to artifacts and unstable reconstructions. To address these limitations, we propose a self-reinforced DIP-FWI (SRDIP-FWI) framework, in which a steering algorithm alternately updates both the network parameters and the input at each iteration using feedback from the current network output. This design allows adaptive structural enhancement and improved regularization, thereby effectively mitigating the ill-posedness in FWI. Additionally, we analyze the spectral bias of the network in SRDIP-FWI and quantify its role in multiscale velocity model building. Synthetic tests and field land data application demonstrate that SRDIP-FWI achieves superior resolution, improved accuracy and greater depth penetration compared to multiscale FWI. More importantly, SRDIP-FWI eliminates the need for manual frequency-band selection and time-window picking, substantially simplifying the inversion workflow. Overall, the proposed method provides a novel, adaptive and robust framework for accurate subsurface velocity model reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Trans-Arctic route feasibility on a pan-Arctic grid under bathymetric and sea-ice constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate driven reductions in Arctic sea ice have renewed interest in trans Arctic shipping, but adoption remains limited by basic questions of route feasibility, safety and excess distance. Existing studies mostly compare idealised great circle shortcuts or use full weather routing systems, leaving a gap for simple basin scale diagnostics on realistic bathymetry and sea ice. We develop an offline graph based framework on a 0.5 degree pan Arctic grid that combines GEBCO 2024 bathymetry with a summer 2018 Arctic sea ice reanalysis from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). An A* pathfinding algorithm is applied to a canonical Europe Asia origin destination pair to quantify route availability and route length inflation relative to a great circle. Enforcing sea only feasibility increases route length by about 10 percent before depth and ice constraints are applied. Depth thresholds representative of under keel clearance (hmin = 20-50 m) remove up to roughly 15 percent of the sea mask but preserve a trans Arctic connection for hmin = 20 m. Summer sea ice exerts a strong seasonal control: continuous ice safe routes emerge only from mid August, with distances inflated by roughly 20-25 percent even in late summer. When depth and ice constraints are imposed jointly, only about 75 percent of sea cells remain safe and no continuous joint safe trans Arctic route exists in the tested season. The framework provides a basin scale screening tool for Arctic shipping and a baseline for forecast driven, multi objective routing studies.</description>

      <title>Near real-time channel selection for Distributed Acoustic Sensing technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology is advancing seismic monitoring by providing dense observations near earthquake sources. However, the resulting data volumes often limit real-time processing capability, with most seismological applications focusing on retrospective analysis of seismic sequences. To address this challenge, we introduce ORION, a fast and versatile selector of high-quality DAS channels that efficiently reduces the amount of data to analyze. The method first adopts spatial clustering to identify cable segments with similar geometrical attributes (e.g, azimuth), and then performs channel selection within each section using waveform attributes (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio); this approach enables spatial sub-sampling while preserving azimuthal coverage. We demonstrate the flexibility of the selector across several cable geometries. Finally, we analyze a seismic sequence using ORION-selected channels and compare the source locations with those from a more conventional uniform distribution of channels along the cable, showing improvements in hypocenter accuracy.</description>

      <title>A microstructural rheological model for transient creep in polycrystalline ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slow creep of glacial ice plays a key role in sea-level rise, yet its transient deformation remains poorly understood. Glen's flow law, where strain rate is simply a function of stress, cannot predict the time-dependent creep behavior observed in experiments. Here we present a physics-based rheological model that captures all three regimes of transient creep in polycrystalline ice. The key components of the model are a series of Kelvin-Voigt mechanical elements that produce a power-law (Andrade) creep, and a single viscous element with microstructure and stress dependence that represents reorientation in the polycrystalline grains. The interplay between these components produces a minimum in the strain rate at approximately 1% strain, which is a universal but unexplained feature reported in experiments. Due to its transient nature, the model exhibits fractional power-law exponents in the stress dependence of the strain rate minimum, which has been conventionally interpreted as independent physical processes. Taken together, we provide a compact, mechanistic framework for transient ice rheology that generalizes to other polycrystalline materials and can be integrated into constitutive laws for ice-sheet models.</description>

      <title>Icy worlds: Moons and Dwarf Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the outer solar system beyond Jupiter, water ice is a dominant component of planetary bodies, and most solid objects in this region are classified as icy bodies. Icy bodies display a remarkable diversity of geological, geophysical, and atmospheric processes, which differ fundamentally from those of the rocky terrestrial planets. Evidence from past and ongoing spacecraft missions has revealed subsurface oceans, cryovolcanic activity, and tenuous but persistent atmospheres, showing that icy bodies are active and evolving worlds. At the same time, major questions remain unresolved, including the chemical properties of icy materials, the geological histories of their surfaces, and the coupling between internal evolution and orbital dynamics. Current knowledge of the surfaces, interiors, and atmospheres of the principal icy bodies is built on spacecraft measurements, telescopic observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical modeling. Recent contributions from Juno, JWST, and stellar occultation studies have added valuable constraints on atmospheric composition, interior structure, and surface activity. Looking ahead, missions such as JUICE, Europa Clipper, Dragonfly, and the Uranus Orbiter and Probe are expected to deliver substantial progress in the study of icy bodies. Their findings, combined with continued Earth- and space-based observations and laboratory studies, will be critical for assessing the potential habitability of these environments and for placing them within a broader framework of planetary system formation and evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19431v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analyzing the seismicity in natural time and studying the evolution of the fluctuations of the entropy change of seismicity under time reversal for various scales of different length i (number of events), we can identify the approach of a major earthquake (EQ) occurrence. The current investigation is extended from 1984 until 2025 for the seismicity in Japan.</description>

      <title>Granite sliding on granite: friction, wear rates, surface topography, and the scale-dependence of rate-state effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tribological granite-granite contacts as a model for tectonic faulting, combining experiments, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations. The high friction in this system is not dominated by particulate wear or plowing, as frequently assumed, but by cold welding within plastically deformed asperity junctions. We base this conclusion on the observation that wear is repeatedly high after cleaning contacts but decreases as gouge accumulates, while friction shows the opposite trend. Moreover, adding water reduces wear by a factor of ten but barely decreases friction. Thermal and rate-dependent effects - central to most earthquake models-are negligible: friction remains unchanged between -40{\deg}C and 20{\deg}C, across abrupt velocity steps, and after hours of stationary contact. The absence of rate-state effects in our macroscopic samples is rationalized by the scale-dependence of pre-slip. The evolution of surface topography shows that quartz grains become locally smooth, with height spectra isotropic for wavelength below 10 microns but anisotropic at longer wavelengths, similar to natural faults. The resulting gouge particles have the usual characteristic sizes near 100 nm. Molecular dynamics simulations of a rigid, amorphous silica tip sliding on {\alpha}-quartz reproduce not only similar friction coefficients near unity but also other experimentally observed features, including stress-introduced transitions to phases observed in post-mortem faults, as well as theoretical estimates of local flash temperatures. Additionally, they reveal a marked decrease of interfacial shear strength above 600{\deg}C. The overall correspondence between experiments, simulations, theory, and field observations indicates that our model system captures essential aspects of rock friction.</description>

      <title>Calendar Time Local Earthquake Forecasts from Earthquake Nowcasts: A Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Ensemble Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A previous paper discussed a method that builds on local earthquake nowcasts to produce fixed natural time forecasts, where natural time represents counts of small earthquakes since the last large earthquake. In this second paper we extend the natural time forecast to calendar time forecasts using an ensemble approach. The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) magnitude-frequency relation, which was the basis for both methods, states that for every large target earthquake of magnitude greater than MT , there are on average NGR small earthquakes of magnitude MS. The only assumption in our method is that the statistics of the local region are the same as in the larger surrounding regions. The method has significant skill, as defined by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) test, which improves as time since the last major earthquake increases. The probability is conditioned on the number of small earthquakes n(t) that have occurred since the last large earthquake. We do not need to assume a probability model, the probability is instead computed directly as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) associated with the ROC curve. We find that for short time intervals (months), the forecast shows strong main shock clustering, followed by a gradual buildup of probability over the following years leading to the next large earthquake ("elastic rebound"). We apply the method to the same local region as in our first paper around Los Angeles, California, following the January 17, 1994 magnitude M6.7 Northridge earthquake.</description>

      <title>Thermochemical models of outer core convection with heterogeneous core-mantle boundary heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements. A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses, RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers $\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a signature in geomagnetic observations.</description>
