      <title>Line defects in infinite networks of resistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinite resistor networks perturbed by line defects, in which the resistances are periodically modified along a single line. Using the Sherman-Morrison identity applied to the reciprocal-space representation of the lattice Green's function, we develop a general analytical framework for computing the equivalent resistance between arbitrary nodes. The resulting expression is a one-dimensional integral that is evaluated exactly in special cases. While our analysis is carried out for the square lattice, the method readily extends to other lattice geometries and networks with general impedances. Therefore, this framework is useful for studying the boundary behavior of topolectrical circuits, which serve as classical analogs of topological insulators.</description>

      <title>DDNet: A Unified Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Semiconductor Device Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of semiconductor devices plays a critical role in the development of new technology nodes and next-generation devices. Semiconductor device designers largely rely on advanced simulation software to solve the drift-diffusion equations, a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe carrier transport in semiconductor devices. While these tools perform well for forward modeling, they are not suitable to address inverse problems, for example, determining doping profiles, material, and geometrical parameters given a desired device performance. Meanwhile, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have grown in popularity in recent years thanks to their ability to efficiently and accurately solve inverse problems at minimal computational cost compared to forward problems. In this study, we introduce the Drift-Diffusion Network (DDNet), a unified physics-informed deep learning solver for the forward and inverse mesh-free solutions of the drift-diffusion equations of semiconductor device modeling. Using prototypical device configurations in one- and two spatial dimensions, we show that DDNet achieves low absolute and relative error compared to traditional simulation software while additionally solving user-defined inverse problems with minimal computational overhead. We expect that DDNet will benefit semiconductor device modeling by facilitating exploration and discovery of novel device structures across comprehensive parameter sets in a fully automated way.</description>

      <title>Spectral Transitions of the Entanglement Hamiltonian in Monitored Free Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored free fermions through the spectral and eigenstate properties of the entanglement Hamiltonian. By analyzing entanglement scaling, we identify three non-trivial fixed points, for which the entanglement follows exact analytical scaling forms: chaotic unitary dynamics at infinitesimal monitoring, characterized by a Gaussian Page law; a Fermi-liquid fixed point at moderate monitoring, defining a metallic phase with logarithmic entanglement growth and emergent space-time invariance; and a quantum Lifshitz fixed point marking the measurement-induced phase transition into a localized area-law phase. Adopting a random-matrix perspective on the entanglement Hamiltonian, we show that short-range spectral correlations, such as the adjacent gap ratio $\langle \tilde r\rangle$ and the Kullback-Leibler divergence $KL_1$, sharply detect an ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition at the quantum Lifshitz fixed point, and yield precise estimates of the critical point and correlation length exponent. Long-range probes, including the spectral form factor and the associated Thouless time, corroborate this picture, while the variant $KL_2$ uncovers signatures of a possible non-ergodic extended (multifractal) regime at intermediate monitoring strengths. Together, these results establish the entanglement Hamiltonian as a powerful framework for diagnosing metallic, localized, and multifractal regimes in monitored quantum dynamics, and highlight unexpected scaling structures, Fermi-liquid and Lifshitz criticality, that lie beyond current field-theoretic approaches.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition symmetries at the band-edge of a correlated Sn/Si monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its likely antiferromagnetic Mott-correlated ground-state. From the spatial correlations of local density of states (LDOS) maps measured by scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge between extended and localized states at the valence band-edge. Using theoretical analysis to explain the energy-dependent LDOS fluctuations, we estimate the system's conductivity change across this effective metal-insulator transition. Then, we compute the multifractal spectra of iso-energy LDOS maps and show that they follow an exact symmetry relation based on the algebraic structure of nonlinear sigma-models (NL$\sigma$Ms) - the field theory of mesoscopic electronic systems. This observation suggests that NL$\sigma$Ms are valid even in a strongly correlated 2D system, down to conductivity levels as low as g ~ 0.1. We anticipate that the relation may be different in the chiral-superconducting phase reported for p-doped Sn/Si monolayer. Finally, we point out that multifractal analysis could equally be applied to universal conductance fluctuations in magneto-transport experiments.</description>

      <title>Contagion mean field model for transport in urban traffic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called \emph{Fundamental Diagram of Traffic} (FDT), which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.</description>
