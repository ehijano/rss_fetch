      <title>Three-dimensional solitons in fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with exponential saturating nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fractional three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with exponential saturating nonlinearity. In the case of the L\'{e}vy index $\alpha=1.9$, this equation can be considered as a model equation to describe strong Langmuir plasma turbulence. The modulation instability of a plane wave is studied, the regions of instability depending on the L\'{e}vy index, and the corresponding instability growth rates are determined. Numerical solutions in the form of 3D fundamental soliton (ground state) are obtained for different values of the L\'{e}vy index. It was shown that in a certain range of soliton parameters it is stable even in the presence of a sufficiently strong initial random disturbance, and the self-cleaning of the soliton from such initial noise was demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Pattern dynamics of the non-reciprocal Swift-Hohenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pattern dynamics of the one-dimensional non-reciprocal Swift-Hohenberg model. Characteristic spatiotemporal patterns, such as disordered, aligned, swap, chiral-swap, and chiral phases, emerge depending on the parameters. We classify the characteristic spatiotemporal patterns obtained in the numerical simulations by focusing on the spatiotemporal Fourier spectrum of the order parameters. We derive a reduced dynamical system by using the spatial Fourier series expansion. We analyze the bifurcation structure around the fixed points corresponding to the aligned and chiral phases and explain the transitions between them. The disordered phase is destabilized either to the aligned phase or to the chiral phase by the Turing bifurcation or the wave bifurcation, and the aligned phase and the chiral phase are connected by the pitchfork bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Particle and wave dynamics of nonlocal solitons in external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlocal bright solitons subject to external spatially nonuniform potentials. If the potential is slowly varying on the soliton scale, we derive analytical soliton solutions behaving like Newtonian particles. If the potential has the form of an attractive delta-like point defect, we identify different dynamical regimes, defined by the relative strength of the nonlocality and the point defect. In these regimes, the soliton can be trapped at the defect's location, via a nonlinear resonance with a defect mode -- which is found analytically -- reflected by or transmitted through the defect, featuring a wave behavior. Our analytical predictions are corroborated by results of direct numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Procedure to Reveal the Mechanism of Pattern Formation Process by Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.12194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is a versatile tool that can be used to extract scientific knowledge from complex pattern formation processes. However, the physics correspondence between the features obtained from TDA and pattern dynamics does not agree one-to-one, and the physical interpretation of the TDA features needs to be set appropriately according to the phenomenon to be analyzed. In this study, we propose an analytical procedure to physically interpret pattern dynamics through TDA and machine learning techniques. The proposed procedure was applied to the process of magnetic domain pattern formation to quantify non-trivial domain pattern classifications and reveal the nature of the underlying dynamics. On the basis of these findings, we also propose a candidate reduction model to understand the nature of magnetic domain formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ivancevic option pricing model is studied via variational approach. Both the Gaussian anstz and the (sech ansatz are used, and each has a unique results from one another. But in terms of existance of soliton solutions they both agree that hot market temperatures support the existance of soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional quantum droplets in binary quadrupolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability and characteristics of two-dimensional (2D) quasi-isotropic quantum droplets (QDs) of fundamental and vortex types, formed by binary Bose-Einstein condensate with magnetic quadrupole-quadrupole interactions (MQQIs). The magnetic quadrupoles are built as pairs of dipoles and antidipoles polarized along the x-axis. The MQQIs are induced by applying an external magnetic field that varies along the x-axis. The system is modeled by the Gross-Pitaevskii equations including the MQQIs and Lee-Huang-Yang correction to the mean-field approximation. Stable 2D fundamental QDs and quasi-isotropic vortex QDs with topological charges S&lt;4 are produced by means of the imaginary-time-integration method for configurations with the quadrupoles polarized parallel to the systems two-dimensional plane. Effects of the norm and MQQI strength on the QDs are studied in detail. Some results, including an accurate prediction of the effective area, chemical potential, and peak density of QDs, are obtained in an analytical form by means of the Thomas-Fermi approximation. Collisions between moving QDs are studied by means of systematic simulations.</description>
