      <title>The Witt groups of extended quadratic forms over Z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the notion of a quadratic form parameter $Q$ over the integers and of extended quadratic forms with values in $Q$, which we call $Q$-forms. Certain form parameters $Q$ appeared in Wall's work on the classification of almost closed $(q{-}1)$-connected $2q$-manifolds via $Q$-forms. The algebraic theory of general form parameters and extended quadratic forms has been studied in a variety of far more general settings by authors including Bak, Baues, Ranicki and Schlichting.
  In this paper we classify all quadratic form parameters $Q$ over the integers, determine the category of quadratic form parameters $\mathbf{FP}$ and compute the Witt group functor, \[ W_0 \colon \mathbf{FP} \to \mathbf{Ab}, \quad Q \mapsto W_0(Q),\] where $\mathbf{Ab}$ is the category of finitely generated abelian groups and $W_0(Q)$ is the Witt group of nonsingular $Q$-forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a map from the set of all knot types ${\mathcal K}$ to a set $X$. Let $\beta$ be a map from ${\mathcal K}$ to a set $Y$. We define the relation between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to be the image of a map $(\alpha,\beta)$ from ${\mathcal K}$ to $X\times Y$ sending an element $K$ of ${\mathcal K}$ to $(\alpha(K),\beta(K))$. We determine the relations between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for certain $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such as crossing number, unknotting number, bridge number, braid index, genus and canonical genus.</description>

      <title>Quantum master equation and Hodge correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a generalization of Goncharov's Hodge correlator twistor connection. Our generalized version is a connection 1-form with values in a DG Lie algebra of uni-trivalent graphs which may have loops and satisfies some Maurer--Cartan equation. This connection and the Maurer--Cartan equation can be viewed as an arithmetic analogue of effective action and quantum master equation respectively in non-acyclic Chern--Simons perturbation theory associated with the trivial local system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local structure of the representation variety of a knot group into SL(n,C) at certain diagonal representations. In particular we determine the tangent cone of the representation variety at these diagonal representations, and show that the latter can be deformed into irreducible representations. Furthermore, we use Luna's slice theorem to analyze the local structure of the  character variety.</description>

      <title>Writhe invariants of 3-regular spatial graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a necessary condition for two diagrams of $3$-regular spatial graphs with the same underlying abstract graph $G$ to represent isotopic spatial graphs. The test works by reading off the writhes of the knot diagrams coming from a collection of cycles in $G$ in each diagram, and checking whether the writhe tuples differ by an element in the image of a certain map of $\mathbb{Z}$-modules determined by $G$. We exemplify by using our result to distinguish, for each $n \ge 3$, all elements in a certain infinite family of embeddings of the M\"obius ladder $\mathrm{M}_n$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ . We also connect these writhe tuples to a classical invariant of spatial graphs due to Wu and Taniyama.</description>

      <title>Products of free groups inside graph braid groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $\Gamma$ and a number $n$, the associated $n^{th}$ graph braid group $B_n(\Gamma)$ is the fundamental group of the unordered configuration space of $n$ points on $\Gamma$. \'{S}wi\k{a}tkowski showed that for a given $\Gamma$ and $n$ large enough, there is a free abelian subgroup of $B_n(\Gamma)$ of rank equal to the cohomological dimension of $B_n(\Gamma)$. In this note, we observe that at the cost of possibly adding additional points, we can find a subgroup of the same cohomological dimension which is a direct product of non-abelian free groups, and give some applications.</description>

      <title>Patterson-Sullivan theory for coarse cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a theory of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to coarse cocycles of convergence groups. This framework includes Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to the Busemann cocycle on the geodesic boundary of a Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces and Patterson-Sullivan measures on flag manifolds associated to Anosov (or more general transverse) subgroups of semisimple Lie groups, as well as more examples. Under some natural geometric assumptions on the coarse cocycle, we prove existence, uniqueness, and ergodicity results.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow. Moreover, it is strongly mixing. We obtain a higher rank analogue of this theorem. Let $\Gamma$ be a relatively Anosov subgroup of a semisimple real algebraic group $G$. For every linear form $\psi$ tangent to the growth indicator of $\Gamma$, there is a canonical one-dimensional flow space $(\Omega_\psi, m_\psi, \phi_t)$ such that the non-wandering set $\Omega_\Gamma$ for the diagonal flow is a $\ker\psi$-vector bundle over $\Omega_\psi$ and the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\Omega_\Gamma$ is the product $m_\psi \otimes \mathrm{Leb}_{\ker\psi}$. We show that $m_{\psi}$ is of finite measure and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the flow $\{\phi_t\}$. Moreover, $(\Omega_{\psi}, m_{\psi}, \phi_t)$ is strongly mixing. The main ingredient is our construction of a reparameterization of the flow $\{\phi_t\}$ on $\Omega_{\psi}$ by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning cusp space of $\Gamma$, which has an exponentially expanding property along unstable foliations.</description>

      <title>Crossed products of dynamical systems; rigidity Vs. strong proximality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X, \Gamma)$, the corresponding crossed product $C^*$-algebra $C(X) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$ is called reflecting, when every intermediate $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma) &lt; \mathcal{A} &lt; C(X) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$ is of the form $\mathcal{A} = C(Y) \rtimes_{r} \Gamma$, corresponding to a dynamical factor $X \rightarrow Y$. It is called almost reflecting if $\mathbb{E}(\mathcal{A}) \subset \mathcal{A}$ for every such $\mathcal{A}$. These two notions coincide for groups admitting the approximation property (AP). Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary convergence group or a lattice in $\text{SL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ for some $d \ge 2$. We show that any uniformly rigid system $(X,\Gamma)$ is almost reflecting. In particular, this holds for any equicontinuous action. In the von Neumann setting, for the same groups $\Gamma$ and any uniformly rigid system $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu, \Gamma)$ the crossed product algebra $L^{\infty}(X,\mu) \rtimes \Gamma$ is reflecting. An inclusion of algebras $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{B}$ is called $\textit{minimal ambient}$ if there are no intermediate algebras. As a demonstration of our methods, we construct examples of minimal ambient inclusions with various interesting properties in the $C^*$ and the von Neumann settings.</description>

      <title>A Perturbed-Alexander Invariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12298v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we give concise formulas, which lead to a simple and fast computer program that computes a powerful knot invariant. This invariant $\rho_1$ is not new, yet our formulas are by far the simplest and fastest: given a knot we write one of the standard matrices $A$ whose determinant is its Alexander polynomial, yet instead of computing the determinant we consider a certain quadratic expression in the entries of $A^{-1}$. The proximity of our formulas to the Alexander polynomial suggest that they should have a topological explanation. This we don't have yet.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a construction of a folded paper ribbon knot that provides a constant upper bound on the infimal aspect ratio for paper M\"obius bands and annuli with arbitrarily many half-twists. In particular, the construction shows that paper M\"obius bands and annuli with any number of half-twists can be embedded with aspect ratio less than 8.</description>

      <title>On the action of relatively irreducible automorphisms on their train tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and let ${\mathcal G}$ be a free factor system of $G$, namely a free splitting of $G$ as $G=G_1*\dots*G_k*F_r$. In this paper, we study the set of train track points for ${\mathcal G}$-irreducible automorphisms $\phi$ with exponential growth (relatively to ${\mathcal G}$). Such set is known to coincide with the minimally displaced set $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ of $\phi$.
  Our main result is that $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is co-compact, under the action of the cyclic subgroup generated by $\phi$.
  Along the way we obtain other results that could be of independent interest. For instance, we prove that any point of $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is in uniform distance from $\operatorname{Min}(\phi^{-1})$. We also prove that the action of $G$ on the product of the attracting and the repelling trees for $\phi$, is discrete. Finally, we get some fine insight about the local topology of relative outer space.
  As an application, we generalise a classical result of Bestvina, Feighn and Handel for the centralisers of irreducible automorphisms of free groups, in the more general context of relatively irreducible automorphisms of a free product. We also deduce that centralisers of elements of $\operatorname{Out}(F_3)$ are finitely generated, which was previously unknown. Finally, we mention that an immediate corollary of co-compactness is that $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is quasi-isometric to a line.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimation for the K\"uhnel conjecture on embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>
