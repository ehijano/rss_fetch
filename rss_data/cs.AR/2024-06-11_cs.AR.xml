      <title>Scalable and Programmable Look-Up Table based Neural Acceleration (LUT-NA) for Extreme Energy Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional digital implementations of neural accelerators are limited by high power and area overheads, while analog and non-CMOS implementations suffer from noise, device mismatch, and reliability issues. This paper introduces a CMOS Look-Up Table (LUT)-based Neural Accelerator (LUT-NA) framework that reduces the power, latency, and area consumption of traditional digital accelerators through pre-computed, faster look-ups while avoiding noise and mismatch of analog circuits. To solve the scalability issues of conventional LUT-based computation, we split the high-precision multiply and accumulate (MAC) operations into lower-precision MACs using a divide-and-conquer-based approach. We show that LUT-NA achieves up to $29.54\times$ lower area with $3.34\times$ lower energy per inference task than traditional LUT-based techniques and up to $1.23\times$ lower area with $1.80\times$ lower energy per inference task than conventional digital MAC-based techniques (Wallace Tree/Array Multipliers) without retraining and without affecting accuracy, even on lottery ticket pruned (LTP) models that already reduce the number of required MAC operations by up to 98%. Finally, we introduce mixed precision analysis in LUT-NA framework for various LTP models (VGG11, VGG19, Resnet18, Resnet34, GoogleNet) that achieved up to $32.22\times$-$50.95\times$ lower area across models with $3.68\times$-$6.25\times$ lower energy per inference than traditional LUT-based techniques, and up to $1.35\times$-$2.14\times$ lower area requirement with $1.99\times$-$3.38\times$ lower energy per inference across models as compared to conventional digital MAC-based techniques with $\sim$1% accuracy loss.</description>

      <title>Investigating Memory Failure Prediction Across CPU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale datacenters often experience memory failures, where Uncorrectable Errors (UEs) highlight critical malfunction in Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMMs). Existing approaches primarily utilize Correctable Errors (CEs) to predict UEs, yet they typically neglect how these errors vary between different CPU architectures, especially in terms of Error Correction Code (ECC) applicability. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between CEs and UEs across different CPU architectures, including X86 and ARM. Our analysis identifies unique patterns of memory failure associated with each processor platform. Leveraging Machine Learning (ML) techniques on production datasets, we conduct the memory failure prediction in different processors' platforms, achieving up to 15% improvements in F1-score compared to the existing algorithm. Finally, an MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) framework is provided to consistently improve the failure prediction in the production environment.</description>

      <title>Highly Versatile FPGA-Implemented Cyber Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, quantum Ising machines have drawn a lot of attention, but due to physical implementation constraints, it has been difficult to achieve dense coupling, such as full coupling with sufficient spins to handle practical large-scale applications. Consequently, classically computable equations have been derived from quantum master equations for these quantum Ising machines. Parallel implementations of these algorithms using FPGAs have been used to rapidly find solutions to these problems on a scale that is difficult to achieve in physical systems. We have developed an FPGA implemented cyber coherent Ising machine (cyber CIM) that is much more versatile than previous implementations using FPGAs. Our architecture is versatile since it can be applied to the open-loop CIM, which was proposed when CIM research began, to the closed-loop CIM, which has been used recently, as well as to Jacobi successive over-relaxation method. By modifying the sequence control code for the calculation control module, other algorithms such as Simulated Bifurcation (SB) can also be implemented. Earlier research on large-scale FPGA implementations of SB and CIM used binary or ternary discrete values for connections, whereas the cyber CIM used FP32 values. Also, the cyber CIM utilized Zeeman terms that were represented as FP32, which were not present in other large-scale FPGA systems. Our implementation with continuous interaction realizes N=4096 on a single FPGA, comparable to the single-FPGA implementation of SB with binary interactions, with N=4096. The cyber CIM enables applications such as CDMA multi-user detector and L0 compressed sensing which were not possible with earlier FPGA systems, while enabling superior calculation speeds, more than ten times faster than a GPU implementation. The calculation speed can be further improved by increasing parallelism, such as through clustering.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Posits for Spectral Analysis Using a Software-Defined Dataflow Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral analysis plays an important role in detection of damage in structures and deep learning. The choice of a floating-point format plays a crucial role in determining the accuracy and performance of spectral analysis. The IEEE Std 754\textsuperscript{TM} floating-point format (IEEE~754 for short) is supported by most major hardware vendors for ``normal'' floats. However, it has several limitations. Previous work has attempted to evaluate posit format with respect to accuracy and performance. The accuracy of the posit has been established over IEEE~754 for a variety of applications. For example, our analysis of the Fast Fourier Transform shows 2x better accuracy when using a 32-bit posit vs. a 32-bit IEEE754 format. For spectral analysis, 32-bit posits are substantially more accurate than 32-bit IEEE~754 floats. Although posit has shown better accuracy than IEEE~754, a fair evaluation of posit with IEEE~754 format using a real hardware implementation has been lacking so far. A software simulation of posit format on an x86 CPU is about $\mathbf{69.3\times}$ slower than native IEEE~754 hardware for normal floats for a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of $\mathbf{2^{28}}$ points. We propose the use of a software-defined dataflow architecture to evaluate performance and accuracy of posits in spectral analysis. Our dataflow architecture uses reconfigurable logical elements that express algorithms using only integer operations. Our architecture does not have an FPU, and we express both IEEE~754 and posit arithmetic using the same integer operations within the hardware. On our dataflow architecture, the posit format is only $\mathbf{1.8\times}$ slower than IEEE~754 for a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of $\mathbf{2^{28}\approx 268}$ million points. With this implementation, we empirically propose a new lower bound for the performance of posit compared to IEEE~754 format.</description>

      <title>fSEAD: a Composable FPGA-based Streaming Ensemble Anomaly Detection Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning ensembles combine multiple base models to produce a more accurate output. They can be applied to a range of machine learning problems, including anomaly detection. In this paper, we investigate how to maximize the composability and scalability of an FPGA-based streaming ensemble anomaly detector (fSEAD). To achieve this, we propose a flexible computing architecture consisting of multiple partially reconfigurable regions, pblocks, which each implement anomaly detectors. Our proof-of-concept design supports three state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms: Loda, RS-Hash and xStream. Each algorithm is scalable, meaning multiple instances can be placed within a pblock to improve performance. Moreover, fSEAD is implemented using High-level synthesis (HLS), meaning further custom anomaly detectors can be supported. Pblocks are interconnected via an AXI-switch, enabling them to be composed in an arbitrary fashion before combining and merging results at run-time to create an ensemble that maximizes the use of FPGA resources and accuracy. Through utilizing reconfigurable Dynamic Function eXchange (DFX), the detector can be modified at run-time to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We compare fSEAD to an equivalent central processing unit (CPU) implementation using four standard datasets, with speed-ups ranging from $3\times$ to $8\times$.</description>

      <title>A Gigabit, DMA-enhanced Open-Source Ethernet Controller for Mixed-Criticality Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing revolution in application domains targeting autonomous navigation, first and foremost automotive "zonalization", has increased the importance of certain off-chip communication interfaces, particularly Ethernet. The latter will play an essential role in next-generation vehicle architectures as the backbone connecting simultaneously and instantaneously the zonal/domain controllers. There is thereby an incumbent need to introduce a performant Ethernet controller in the open-source HW community, to be used as a proxy for architectural explorations and prototyping of mixed-criticality systems (MCSs). Driven by this trend, in this work, we propose a fully open-source, DMA-enhanced, technology-agnostic Gigabit Ethernet architecture that overcomes the limitations of existing open-source architectures, such as Lowrisc's Ethernet, often tied to FPGA implementation, performance-bound by sub-optimal design choices such as large memory buffers, and in general not mature enough to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Besides the area advantage, the proposed design increases packet transmission speed up to almost 3x compared to Lowrisc's and is validated through implementation and FPGA prototyping into two open-source, heterogeneous MCSs.</description>

      <title>Towards Long Range Detection of Elephants Using Seismic Signals; A Geophone-Sensor Interface for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The long-distance detection of the presence of elephants is pivotal to addressing the human-elephant conflict. IoT-based solutions utilizing seismic signals originating from the movement of elephants are a novel approach to solving this problem. This study introduces an instrumentation system comprising a specially designed geophone-sensor interface for non-invasive, long-range elephant detection using seismic waves while minimizing the vulnerability of seismic signals to noise. The geophone-sensor interface involves a cascade array of an instrumentation amplifier, a second-order Butterworth filter for signal filtering, and a signal amplifier. The introduced geophone-sensor interface was tested under laboratory conditions, and then real-world experiments were carried out for tamed, partly tamed, and untamed elephants. The experimental results reveal that the system remains stable within the tested frequency range from 1 Hz to 1 kHz and the temperature range of 10C to 40C. The system successfully captured the seismic signals generated by the footfalls of elephants within a maximum detection range of 155.6 m, with an overall detection accuracy of 99.5%.</description>

      <title>LLM-Enhanced Bayesian Optimization for Efficient Analog Layout Constraint Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog layout synthesis faces significant challenges due to its dependence on manual processes, considerable time requirements, and performance instability. Current Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based techniques for analog layout synthesis, despite their potential for automation, suffer from slow convergence and extensive data needs, limiting their practical application. This paper presents the \texttt{LLANA} framework, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance BO by exploiting the few-shot learning abilities of LLMs for more efficient generation of analog design-dependent parameter constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that \texttt{LLANA} not only achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) BO methods but also enables a more effective exploration of the analog circuit design space, thanks to LLM's superior contextual understanding and learning efficiency. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/dekura/LLANA}.</description>

      <title>Residue Number System (RNS) based Distributed Quantum Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Arithmetic faces limitations such as noise and resource constraints in the current Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers. We propose using Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) to overcome these limitations by substituting a higher depth quantum addition circuit with Residue Number System (RNS) based quantum modulo adders. The RNS-based distributed quantum addition circuits possess lower depth and are distributed across multiple quantum computers/jobs, resulting in higher noise resilience. We propose the Quantum Superior Modulo Addition based on RNS Tool (QSMART), which can generate RNS sets of quantum adders based on multiple factors such as depth, range, and efficiency. We also propose a novel design of Quantum Diminished-1 Modulo (2n + 1) Adder (QDMA), which forms a crucial part of RNS-based distributed quantum addition and the QSMART tool. We demonstrate the higher noise resilience of the Residue Number System (RNS) based distributed quantum addition by conducting simulations modeling Quantinuum's H1 ion trap-based quantum computer. Our simulations demonstrate that RNS-based distributed quantum addition has 11.36% to 133.15% higher output probability over 6-bit to 10-bit non-distributed quantum full adders, indicating higher noise fidelity. Furthermore, we present a scalable way of achieving distributed quantum addition higher than limited otherwise by the 20-qubit range of Quantinuum H1.</description>

      <title>SemPat: Using Hyperproperty-based Semantic Analysis to Generate Microarchitectural Attack Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microarchitectural security verification of software has seen the emergence of two broad classes of approaches. The first is based on semantic security properties (e.g., non-interference) which are verified for a given program and a specified abstract model of the hardware microarchitecture. The second is based on attack patterns, which, if found in a program execution, indicates the presence of an exploit. While the former uses a formal specification that can capture several gadget variants targeting the same vulnerability, it is limited by the scalability of verification. Patterns, while more scalable, must be currently constructed manually, as they are narrower in scope and sensitive to gadget-specific structure.
  This work develops a technique that, given a non-interference-based semantic security hyperproperty, automatically generates attack patterns up to a certain complexity parameter (called the skeleton size). Thus, we combine the advantages of both approaches: security can be specified by a hyperproperty that uniformly captures several gadget variants, while automatically generated patterns can be used for scalable verification. We implement our approach in a tool and demonstrate the ability to generate new patterns, (e.g., for SpectreV1, SpectreV4) and improved scalability using the generated patterns over hyperproperty-based verification.</description>

      <title>Procrastination Is All You Need: Exponent Indexed Accumulators for Floating Point, Posits and Logarithmic Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a simple and effective method for the summation of long sequences of floating point numbers. The method comprises two phases: an accumulation phase where the mantissas of the floating point numbers are added to accumulators indexed by the exponents and a reconstruction phase where the actual summation result is finalised. Various architectural details are given for both FPGAs and ASICs including fusing the operation with a multiplier, creating efficient MACs. Some results are presented for FPGAs, including a tensor core capable of multiplying and accumulating two 4x4 matrices of bfloat16 values every clock cycle using ~6,400 LUTs + 64 DSP48 in AMD FPGAs at 700+ MHz. The method is then extended to posits and logarithmic numbers.</description>

      <title>Sectored DRAM: A Practical Energy-Efficient and High-Performance Fine-Grained DRAM Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Sectored DRAM, a new, low-overhead DRAM substrate that reduces wasted energy by enabling fine-grained DRAM data transfers and DRAM row activation. Sectored DRAM leverages two key ideas to enable fine-grained data transfers and row activation at low chip area cost. First, a cache block transfer between main memory and the memory controller happens in a fixed number of clock cycles where only a small portion of the cache block (a word) is transferred in each cycle. Sectored DRAM augments the memory controller and the DRAM chip to execute cache block transfers in a variable number of clock cycles based on the workload access pattern with minor modifications to the memory controller's and the DRAM chip's circuitry. Second, a large DRAM row, by design, is already partitioned into smaller independent physically isolated regions. Sectored DRAM provides the memory controller with the ability to activate each such region based on the workload access pattern via small modifications to the DRAM chip's array access circuitry. Activating smaller regions of a large row relaxes DRAM power delivery constraints and allows the memory controller to schedule DRAM accesses faster.
  Compared to a system with coarse-grained DRAM, Sectored DRAM reduces the DRAM energy consumption of highly-memory-intensive workloads by up to (on average) 33% (20%) while improving their performance by up to (on average) 36% (17%). Sectored DRAM's DRAM energy savings, combined with its system performance improvement, allows system-wide energy savings of up to 23%. Sectored DRAM's DRAM chip area overhead is 1.7% the area of a modern DDR4 chip. We hope and believe that Sectored DRAM's ideas and results will help to enable more efficient and high-performance memory systems. To this end, we open source Sectored DRAM at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/Sectored-DRAM.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a composite inner-product computation unit based on left-to-right (LR) arithmetic for the acceleration of convolution neural networks (CNN) on hardware. The efficacy of the proposed L2R-CIPU method has been shown on the VGG-16 network, and assessment is done on various performance metrics. The L2R-CIPU design achieves 1.06x to 6.22x greater performance, 4.8x to 15x more TOPS/W, and 4.51x to 53.45x higher TOPS/mm2 than prior architectures.</description>
