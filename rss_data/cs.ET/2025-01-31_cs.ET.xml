      <title>Scalable intensity-based photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using single-wavelength time-division-multiplexed signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits provide a compact platform for ultrafast and energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in the optical domain. Recently, schemes based on time-division multiplexing (TDM) have been proposed as scalable approaches for realizing large-scale photonic MVM processors. However, existing demonstrations rely on coherent detection or multiple wavelengths, both of which complicate their operations. In this work, we demonstrate a scalable TDM-based photonic MVM processor that uses only single-wavelength intensity-modulated optical signals, thereby avoiding coherent detection and enabling simplified operations. A 32-channel processor is fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform and used to experimentally perform convolution operations in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for handwritten digit recognition, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.47% for 1500 images.</description>

      <title>Solving Drone Routing Problems with Quantum Computing: A Hybrid Approach Combining Quantum Annealing and Gate-Based Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid approach to solving real-world drone routing problems by leveraging the capabilities of quantum computing. The proposed method, coined Quantum for Drone Routing (Q4DR), integrates the two most prominent paradigms in the field: quantum gate-based computing, through the Eclipse Qrisp programming language; and quantum annealers, by means of D-Wave System's devices. The algorithm is divided into two different phases: an initial clustering phase executed using a Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and a routing phase employing quantum annealers. The efficacy of Q4DR is demonstrated through three use cases of increasing complexity, each incorporating real-world constraints such as asymmetric costs, forbidden paths, and itinerant charging points. This research contributes to the growing body of work in quantum optimization, showcasing the practical applications of quantum computing in logistics and route planning.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of Learning Aware HMI For Learning-Enabled Increasingly Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), autonomous agents are increasingly expected to manage complex situations where learning-enabled algorithms are vital. However, the integration of these advanced algorithms poses significant challenges, especially concerning safety and reliability. This research emphasizes the importance of incorporating human-machine collaboration into the systems engineering process to design learning-enabled increasingly autonomous systems (LEIAS). Our proposed LEIAS architecture emphasizes communication representation and pilot preference learning to boost operational safety. Leveraging the Soar cognitive architecture, the system merges symbolic decision logic with numeric decision preferences enhanced through reinforcement learning. A core aspect of this approach is transparency; the LEIAS provides pilots with a comprehensive, interpretable view of the system's state, encompassing detailed evaluations of sensor reliability, including GPS, IMU, and LIDAR data. This multi-sensor assessment is critical for diagnosing discrepancies and maintaining trust. Additionally, the system learns and adapts to pilot preferences, enabling responsive, context-driven decision-making. Autonomy is incrementally escalated based on necessity, ensuring pilots retain control in standard scenarios and receive assistance only when required. Simulation studies conducted in Microsoft's XPlane simulation environment to validate this architecture's efficacy, showcasing its performance in managing sensor anomalies and enhancing human-machine collaboration, ultimately advancing safety in complex operational environments.</description>

      <title>Automating Physics-Based Reasoning for SysML Model Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System and software design benefits greatly from formal modeling, allowing for automated analysis and verification early in the design phase. Current methods excel at checking information flow and component interactions, ensuring consistency, and identifying dependencies within Systems Modeling Language (SysML) models. However, these approaches often lack the capability to perform physics-based reasoning about a system's behavior represented in SysML models, particularly in the electromechanical domain. This significant gap critically hinders the ability to automatically and effectively verify the correctness and consistency of the model's behavior against well-established underlying physical principles. Therefore, this paper presents an approach that leverages existing research on function representation, including formal languages, graphical representations, and reasoning algorithms, and integrates them with physics-based verification techniques. Four case studies (coffeemaker, vacuum cleaner, hairdryer, and wired speaker) are inspected to illustrate the model's practicality and effectiveness in performing physics-based reasoning on systems modeled in SysML. This automated physics-based reasoning is broken into two main categories: (i) structural, which is performed on BDD and IBD, and (ii) functional, which is then performed on activity diagrams. This work advances the field of automated reasoning by providing a framework for verifying structural and functional correctness and consistency with physical laws within SysML models.</description>

      <title>A 9T4R RRAM-Based ACAM for Analogue Template Matching at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous shift of computational bottlenecks to the memory access and data transfer, especially for AI applications, poses the urgent needs of re-engineering the computer architecture fundamentals. Many edge computing applications, like wearable and implantable medical devices, introduce increasingly more challenges to conventional computing systems due to the strict requirements of area and power at the edge. Emerging technologies, like Resistive RAM (RRAM), have shown a promising momentum in developing neuro-inspired analogue computing paradigms capable of achieving high classification capabilities alongside high energy efficiency. In this work, we present a novel RRAM-based Analogue Content Addressable Memory (ACAM) for on-line analogue template matching applications. This ACAM-based template matching architecture aims to achieve energy-efficient classification where low energy is of utmost importance. We are showcasing a highly tuneable novel RRAM-based ACAM pixel implemented using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology and in-house RRAM technology and exhibiting low energy dissipation of approximately 0.036pJ and 0.16pJ for mismatch and match, respectively, at 66MHz with 3V voltage supply. A proof-of-concept system-level implementation based on this novel pixel design is also implemented in 180nm.</description>
