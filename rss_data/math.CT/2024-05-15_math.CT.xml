      <title>Compositional imprecise probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imprecise probability is concerned with uncertainty about which probability distributions to use. It has applications in robust statistics and elsewhere. Imprecise probability can be modelled in various ways, including by convex sets of probability distributions.
  We look at programming language models for imprecise probability. Our desiderata are that we would like our model to support all kinds of composition, categorical and monoidal, in other words, guided by dataflow diagrams. Another equivalent perspective is that we would like a model of synthetic probability in the sense of Markov categories.
  There is already a fairly popular monad-based approach to imprecise probability, but it is not fully compositional because the monad involved is not commutative, which means that we do not have a proper monoidal structure. In this work, we provide a new fully compositional account. The key idea is to name the non-deterministic choices. To manage the renamings and disjointness of names, we use graded monads. We show that the resulting compositional model is maximal. We relate with the earlier monad approach, showing that we obtain tighter bounds on the uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Persistent Homology Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial interpretation of the persistence diagram as a M\"obius inversion was recently shown to be functorial. We employ this discovery to recast the Persistent Homology Transform of a geometric complex as a representation of a cellulation on $\mathbb{S}^n$ to the category of combinatorial persistence diagrams. Detailed examples are provided. We hope this recasting of the PH transform will allow for the adoption of existing methods from algebraic and topological combinatorics to the study of shapes.</description>

      <title>Smooth generalized symmetries of quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum field theories (QFTs), such as those in which spacetimes are equipped with a metric and/or a field in the form of a smooth map to a target manifold, can be formulated axiomatically using the language of $\infty$-categories. According to a geometric version of the cobordism hypothesis, such QFTs collectively assemble themselves into objects in an $\infty$-topos of smooth spaces. We show how this allows one to define and study generalized global symmetries of such QFTs. The symmetries are themselves smooth, so the `higher-form' symmetry groups can be endowed with, e.g., a Lie group structure.
  Among the more surprising general implications for physics are, firstly, that QFTs in spacetime dimension $d$, considered collectively, can have $d$-form symmetries, going beyond the known $(d-1)$-form symmetries of individual QFTs and, secondly, that a global symmetry of a QFT can be anomalous even before we try to gauge it, due to a failure to respect either smoothness (in that a symmetry of an individual QFT does not smoothly extend to QFTs collectively) or locality (in that a symmetry of an unextended QFT does not extend to an extended one).
  Smoothness anomalies are shown to occur even in 2-state systems in quantum mechanics (here formulated axiomatically by equipping $d=1$ spacetimes with a metric, an orientation, and perhaps some unitarity structure). Locality anomalies are shown to occur even for invertible QFTs defined on $d=1$ spacetimes equipped with an orientation and a smooth map to a target manifold. These correspond in physics to topological actions for a particle moving on the target and the relation to an earlier classification of such actions using invariant differential cohomology is elucidated.</description>
