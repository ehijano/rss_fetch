      <title>Behavioral patterns and mean-field games in epidemiological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of Mean Field Game epidemiological models, in which subpopulations have different behavioral patterns: some are viewed as "highly rational" (choosing Nash-equilibrium long-term strategies) while others follow pre-specified "non-rational" patterns (e.g., either sticking to their usual habits or trying to mimic those around them). Our model also allows for occasional behavioral switches, which rational individuals also take into account when formulating their Nash-equilibrium strategies. While this modeling approach is general, here we develop it for individuals choosing their "contact rates" within a particular Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible-Dead (SIRSD) epidemics model. The latter is based on a frequency-based force of infection and the mortality rate that rapidly increases once the proportion of infected individuals exceeds some prescribed threshold, resulting in a strain on medical resources. Numerical tests illustrate the properties of our model and highlight the ways in which additional/non-rational behavioral patterns and behavioral switching increase the impact of infectious diseases. The paper aims to build a bridge between two distinct communities of epidemiological modelers and to promote the consideration of behavioral patterns in broader Mean Field Games literature.</description>

      <title>Phenotype-structuring of non-local kinetic models of cell migration driven by environmental sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capability of cells to form surface extensions to non-locally probe the surrounding environment plays a key role in cell migration. The existing mathematical models for migration of cell populations driven by this non-local form of environmental sensing rely on the simplifying assumption that cells in the population share the same cytoskeletal properties, and thus form surface extensions of the same size. To overcome this simplification, we develop a kinetic modelling framework wherein a population of migrating cells is structured by a continuous phenotypic variable that captures variability in structural properties of the cytoskeleton. This framework provides a multiscale representation of cell migration, from single-cell dynamics to population-level behaviours, as we start with a microscopic model that describes the dynamics of single cells in terms of stochastic processes. Next, we formally derive the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which consists of a phenotype-structured kinetic equation that features a phenotype-dependent non-locality. Then, considering an appropriately rescaled version of this kinetic equation, we formally derive the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a partial differential equation for the cell number density. To validate the formal procedures employed to derive the macroscopic model from the microscopic model, through the mesoscopic one, we first compare the results of numerical simulations of the two models. We then compare numerical solutions of the macroscopic model with the results of cell locomotion assays, to test the ability of the model to recapitulate qualitative features of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Cell differentiation can underpin the reproducibility of morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Morphogenesis of complex body shapes is reproducible despite the noise inherent in the underlying morphogenetic processes. However, how these morphogenetic processes work together to achieve this reproducibility remains unclear. Here, we ask how morphogenetic reproducibility is realised by developing a computational model that evolves complex morphologies. We find that evolved, complex morphologies are reproducible in a sizeable fraction of simulations, despite no direct selection for reproducibility. We show that high reproducibility is caused by segregating moving cells that "shape" morphologies from stationary cells that "maintain" morphologies during morphogenesis. Strikingly, most highly reproducible morphologies also evolved cell differentiation, where proliferative, moving stem cells (i.e., progenitor cells) irreversibly differentiate into non-dividing, stationary differentiated cells. These results suggest that cell differentiation observed in natural development plays a fundamental role in morphogenesis in addition to the production of specialised cell types. This previously-unrecognised role of cell differentiation has major implications for our understanding of how morphologies are generated and regenerated.</description>
