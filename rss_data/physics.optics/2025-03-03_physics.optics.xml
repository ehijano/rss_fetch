      <title>Advancing excited-state simulations for TADF emitters: An eXtended Tight-Binding framework for high-throughput screening and design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computationally efficient framework for predicting the excited-state properties of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters, integrating extended tight-binding (\xtb), simplified Tamm-Dancoff approximation (\stda), and simplified time-dependent density functional theory (\stddft) methods. Benchmarking against Tamm-Dancoff approximation (noted full \tda) demonstrates that this approach accurately captures key photophysical properties, including singlet-triplet energy gaps, excitation energies, and fluorescence spectra, in both vacuum and solvent environments, while achieving over 99\% reduction in computational cost. We analyze a series of representative TADF emitters, revealing a strong correlation between the torsional angle between donor and acceptor units and the solvent-induced redshift in the emission spectrum. This work highlights the potential of semi-empirical methods for high-throughput screening of TADF materials and provides valuable insights for designing next-generation optoelectronic devices. The multi-objective function is one of a kind, and it further enhances our results with an original solution. While acknowledging the limitations of semi-empirical methods for highly complex systems, we outline promising future directions, including hybrid computational approaches and integration with machine learning techniques, to further improve predictive accuracy and accelerate the discovery of advanced functional materials.</description>

      <title>Contrary to widespread belief, the Fresnel zone plate outperforms the metalens at high NA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous simulations challenge recent claims that metalenses outperform conventional diffractive lenses, such as Fresnel Zone Plates (FZPs), in focusing efficiency at high numerical apertures (NAs). Across various lens diameters, FZPs exhibit a pronounced asymmetry in the shadow effect, leading to significantly higher focusing efficiency when optimally oriented. Extending this analysis, we show that conventional blazed gratings also surpass meta-gratings in efficiency. Since any linear optical element can be decomposed into local gratings, these findings broadly underscore the superiority of blazed structures over binary metastructures. Experimental characterization of an FZP with diameter = 3 mm, focal length = 0.2 mm operating at $\lambda$ = 634 nm confirms the dependence of efficiency on illumination direction. Our results emphasize the need for rigorous, direct comparisons between meta-optics and traditional diffractive optics to ensure accurate performance assessments.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spatiotemporal optical vortices and vortex chains from Hermite-Gauss modes with a tilted pulse front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hermite-Gaussian (HG) beams are standard modes delivered by continuous or pulsed lasers systems, and pulse-front tilt is one of the most common, detrimental or beneficial, spatiotemporal couplings affecting ultrashort pulses. Combining them, we show that focusing a pulsed HG beam with a tilt generates an elliptical spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV), or a chain of them. The elliptical STOVs differ from standard STOVs in an additional spatial chirp that is manifested as a wave front temporal rotation, and results in an enhanced transverse orbital angular momentum. The longitudinal field is significantly larger than that of normal STOVs, and may also take the form of an elliptical STOV. Our concept greatly simplifies previous arrangements for the generation of STOVs, whose additional features make them attractive for improving their applications in electron trapping and acceleration, or as driving fields for the generation of higher-order harmonics and other interactions with matter.</description>

      <title>Broadband Absorption in Cadmium Telluride Thin-Film Solar Cells via Composite Light Trapping Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite light-trapping structures offer a promising approach to achieving broadband absorption and high efficiency in thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) in order to accelerate sustainable energy solutions. As the leading material in thin-film solar technology, cadmium telluride (CdTe) faces challenges from surface reflective losses across the solar spectrum and weak absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) range. This computational study addresses these limitations by employing a dual light trapping technique: the top surfaces of both the CdS and CdTe layers are tapered as nanocones (NCs), while germanium (Ge) spherical nanoparticles (NPs) are embedded within the CdTe absorber layer to enhance broadband absorption. Numerical simulations using Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) and other methods are used to optimize the parameters and configurations of both nanostructures, aiming to achieve peak optoelectronic performance. The results show that a short-circuit current density ($J_{sc}$) of 35.38 mA/$cm^2$ and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.76% can be achieved with optimal nanocone (NC) texturing and spherical Ge nanoparticle (NP) configurations, a 45.45% and 80.72% increase compared to baseline structure in $J_{sc}$ and PCE respectively. To understand the enhancement mechanisms, the study includes analyses using diffraction grating theory and Mie theory. Fabricability of these structures is also evaluated. Furthermore, an additional study on the effects of incident angle variation and polarization change demonstrates that the optimal structure is robust under practical conditions, maintaining consistent performance.</description>

      <title>Extreme Ultraviolet High-Harmonic Interferometry of Excitation-Induced Bandgap Dynamics in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometry is a fundamental technique in physics, enabling precise measurements through the interference of waves. High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids has emerged as a powerful method for probing ultrafast electronic dynamics within crystalline structures.
  In this study, we employed extreme ultraviolet (XUV) high-harmonic interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulse pairs to investigate excitation-induced bandgap dynamics in solids. Our experiments on amorphous SiO2 and crystalline MgO, complemented by analytical modeling and semiconductor Bloch equation simulations, reveal a correlation between transient bandgap modifications and variations in the phase of harmonic emission. These findings suggest a potential pathway for sub-cycle, all-optical control of band structure modifications, advancing prospects for petahertz-scale electronic applications and attosecond diagnostics of carrier dynamics.</description>

      <title>A systolic update scheme to overcome memory bandwidth limitations in GPU-accelerated FDTD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence has fueled the development of high-bandwidth photonic interconnect fabrics as a critical component of modern AI supercomputers. As the demand for ever-increasing AI compute and connectivity continues to grow, the need for high-throughput photonic simulation engines to accelerate and even revolutionize photonic design and verification workflows will become an increasingly indispensable capability for the integrated photonics industry. Unfortunately, the mainstay and workhorse of photonic simulation algorithms, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method, because it is a memory-intensive but computationally-lightweight algorithm, is fundamentally misaligned with modern computational platforms which are equipped to deal with compute intensive workloads instead. This paper introduces a systolic update scheme for the FDTD method, which circumvents this mismatch by reducing the need for global synchronization while also relegating the need to access global memory to the case of boundary values between neighboring subdomains only. We demonstrate a practical implementation of our scheme as applied to the full three-dimensional FDTD algorithm that achieves a performance of roughly 0.15 trillion cell updates per second (TCUPS) on a single Nvidia H100 GPU. Our work paves the way for the increasingly efficient, cost-effective, and high-throughput photonic simulation engines needed to continue powering the AI era.</description>

      <title>Silicon Micro-Disk Resonator Crossbar Array for High-Speed and High-Density Photonic Convolution Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly those based on artificial neural networks, have garnered significant attention for their potential applications in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing. Notably, neural networks make heavy use of matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) operations, causing substantial computing burden on existing electronic computing systems. Optical computing has attracted considerable attention that can perform optical-domain MVM at an ultra-high speed. In this paper, we introduce a novel silicon photonic micro-disk resonator (MDR) crossbar signal processor designed to support matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) with both high processing speed and enhanced computational density. The key innovation of the proposed MDR crossbar processor is the placement of two MDRs at each crosspoint, enabling simultaneous routing and weighting functions. This design effectively doubles the computational density, improving overall performance. We fabricate a silicon photonic MDR crossbar processor, which is employed to perform convolutional tasks in a convolutional neural network (CNN). The experimental results demonstrate that the photonic processor achieves a classification accuracy of 96% on the MNIST dataset. Additionally, it is capable of scaling to a computational speed of up to 160 tera-operations per second (TOPS) and a computational density as high as 25.6 TOPS/mm2. Our approach holds significant promise for enabling highly efficient, scalable on-chip optical computing, with broad potential applications in AI and beyond.</description>

      <title>A chip-based optoelectronic-oscillator frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microresonator-based Kerr frequency combs ("Kerr microcombs") constitute chip-scale frequency combs of broad spectral bandwidth and repetition rate ranging from gigahertz to terahertz. An appealing application exploiting microcombs' coherence and large repetition rate is microwave and millimeter-wave generation. Latest endeavor applying two-point optical frequency division (OFD) on photonic-chip-based microcombs has created microwaves with exceptionally low phase noise. Nevertheless, microcomb-based OFD still requires extensive active locking, additional lasers, and external RF or microwave sources, as well as sophisticated initiation. Here we demonstrate a simple and entirely passive (no active locking) architecture, which incorporates an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) and symphonizes a coherent microcomb and a low-noise microwave spontaneously. Our OEO microcomb leverages state-of-the-art integrated chip devices including a high-power DFB laser, a broadband silicon Mach-Zehnder modulator, an ultralow-loss silicon nitride microresonator, and a high-speed photodetector. Each can be manufactured in large volume with low cost and high yield using established CMOS and III-V foundries. Our system synergizes a microcomb of 10.7 GHz repetition rate and an X-band microwave with phase noise of $-$97/$-$126/$-$130 dBc/Hz at 1/10/100 kHz Fourier frequency offset, yet does not demand active locking, additional lasers, and external RF or microwave sources. With potential to be fully integrated, our OEO microcomb can become an invaluable technology and building block for microwave photonics, radio-over-fiber, and optical communication.</description>

      <title>Calibration-free measurement of the phonon temperature around a single emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emission properties of a localized solid-state emitter are strongly influenced by its environment. The coupling to acoustic phonons impacts the coherence of the emitter and its temperature dependence, and also results in the apparition of phonon sidebands besides the sharp zero-phonon line. Here, we present a method for measuring the absolute temperature of a localized emitter by directly plotting the ratio of the Stokes and anti-Stokes components of the phonon sideband as a function of the shift from the zero-phonon line. This approach requires no calibration and knowledge of the system, making it applicable to a wide range of emitters and materials. We validate the method using a CdSe quantum dot in a ZnSe nanowire. We thus show that the quantum dot is significantly heated under non-resonant excitation when increasing the incident power at low temperature and is ascribed to the drop in thermal conductivity at these temperatures.</description>

      <title>GHz helical acoustic drum modes on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-chip laterally confined GHz acoustic modes with tunable helicity open the way for advanced optomechanical functionalities. Here, we demonstrate a novel concept for the implementation of these functionalites
  through the electrical excitation of GHz membrane-like drum modes. Our concept relies on the strong dependence of the frequency spectrum of Lamb acoustic modes on the thickness of the propagating medium. Lamb
  modes generated by a piezoelectric resonator in a thicker (or thinner) substrate region remain confined in this region via reflections at the lateral boundaries with thinner (thicker) substrate regions. If the generation region is
  disk-shaped, the lateral reflections form drum-like modes, which we experimentally confirm by radio-frequency spectroscopy as well as by maps of the surface displacements. Furthermore, we show that an array of sector shaped piezoelectric transducers powered with appropriate radio-frequency phases creates helical modes with tunable helicity, which can then be transferred to an optical beam. Our analytical and finite-element models yield
  useful insights into the acoustic coupling of bulk and surface modes that can guide adaptation to other material systems. The acoustic drum modes thus provide a flexible platform for acousto-optical chiral functionalities in
  the GHz frequency range.</description>

      <title>Some computational aspects of using Huygens-Fresnel-Kirchoff diffraction theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffraction is a phenomenon, discussed for centuries from various points of view. The very simple principle, proposed by Huygens [1] and then modified by Fresnel[2], Stokes [3] and Kirchoff [4], allows us to make calculations, substituting an incident wave by the multitude of waves, radiated by the number of secondary sources with regard for interference. Besides mentioned scientists, many others have contributed to this theory. A reasonable historical review can reveal a challenging history of the research of this phenomenon with many names and this story is not still ended. A good historical re-view can be seen in [5]. Classical cases of the diffraction by a hole and a disk are included in many text-books for scholars. Nevertheless, there is still some place for discussions. This paper is an attempt to discuss some computational issues, based on the original Huygens-Fresnel-Kirchoff method and apply it to 3D objects.</description>

      <title>All-dry pick-up and transfer method for quantum emitter arrays in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride are based on fluorescent point-like defects. These defects typically have exceptional photophysical properties and therefore been the focus of extensive research due to their potential to advance photonic quantum technologies. However, achieving scalable integration of these emitters to arbitrary platforms with high yield while retaining their characteristics remains a significant challenge, particularly when the target substrate is not compatible with the fabrication method. In this work, we introduce an all-dry transfer method aimed at addressing these challenges with improved effectiveness compared to existing techniques. This polymer stamp-assisted transfer method maintains high output and preserves the fundamental characteristics of the emitters while eliminating wet chemical processes. A comprehensive post-transfer characterization verified not only the maintenance of the defining characteristic of a single photon emitter, the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, but also showed improvement by about 46%. In contrast, the lifetime, emission spectrum, and the photostability showed only negligible change, demonstrating that the characteristics of the emitters were retained during the transfer process. This transfer technique has success rate of 81.8%, determined by the proportion of single photon emitters that retain their optical and preserve physical structure post-transfer. This high success rate shows the potential to scale the integration of single photon emitters across diverse platforms. We expect that this process contributes to the applications of boron nitride defects in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Unambiguous determination of optical constants and thickness of ultrathin films by using optical anisotropic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unambiguous and universal determination of optical constants such as complex refractive indices (n, k) and thickness (d) in one measurement is typically confined for films with a thickness of more than 10~nm that hampers its application for ultra-thin films such as two-dimensional materials. We demonstrate that the commonly accepted limit of n, k, d coupling is overcome in ellipsometry by utilizing anisotropic substrates. In this way, ellipsometry allows to determine n, k and d simultaneously for thicknesses lower than 1~nm with high accuracy. Extensive simulations proof the potential of using anisotropic substrates for decoupling. The simultaneous determination of n, k and d is of great interest in several fields, two-dimensional materials, their heterostructures, ultra thin films for application in quantum technology, plasmonics and nano-photonics.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic waveguides in two-dimensional materials: a quantum mechanical description using semiclassical techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons are likely to play an important role in integrated photonic ciruits, because they strongly interact with light and can be confined to subwavelength scales. These plasmons can be guided and controlled by plasmonic waveguides, which can be created by patterning different materials or by structuring the dielectric environment. We have constructed a semi-analytical theory to describe plasmonic waveguides, and, more generally, plasmons in spatially inhomogeneous systems. Our theory employs techniques from semiclassical analysis, and is therefore applicable when the electron wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of changes in the system parameters. We obtain an effective classical Hamiltonian that describes the dynamics of quantum plasmons, given by the Lindhard function with spatially varying parameters. Adding the wave-like character of the plasmons to the classical trajectories generated by this Hamiltonian, we find two different mechanisms for waveguiding. In the first case, a localized plasmonic state arises due to total internal reflection similar to photonic waveguides. The second mechanism relies on a varying dielectric environment, which locally modifies the screening of the electrons. Here, a quasi-localized state arises due to local changes in the amplitude of the plasmonic excitation. Our results provide a solid basis to understand previous numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Modulation of supernarrow EIT pair via atomic coherence</title>

Abstract: We report the phenomena of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and electromagnetically induced absorption (EIA) using two identical beams in rubidium atomic vapor. The {\Lambda}-type EIT configuration is employed to examine the EIT spectrum for the D1 line in 87Rb F=2 characteristics16 by varying parameters such as frequency detuning, Iprobe/Ipump, the total power of probe and pump beam. Notably, the pump beam is also investigated in this process, which has not been previously studied. We study the effect of of the phase between the two applied fields and find that EIA and EIT can transform into each other by adjusting the relative phase. These finding may have applications in light drag or storage, optical switching, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Photon-drag photovoltaic effects and quantum geometric nature</title>

Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) generates a direct current photocurrent under uniform irradiation and is a nonlinear optical effect traditionally studied in non-centrosymmetric materials. The two main origins of BPVE are the shift and injection currents, arising from transitions in electron position and electron velocity during optical excitation, respectively. Recently, it was proposed that photon-drag effects could unlock BPVE in centrosymmetric materials. However, experimental progress remains limited. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of photon-drag effects inducing BPVE (photon-drag BPVE). Notably, we find that photon-drag BPVE can be directly linked to quantum geometric tensors. Additionally, we propose that photon-drag shift currents can be fully isolated from other current contributions in non-magnetic centrosymmetric materials. We apply our theory explicitly to the 2D topological insulator $1T'$-WTe$_2$. Furthermore, we investigate photon-drag BPVE in a centrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal, where we demonstrate that linearly polarized light generates photon-drag shift currents.</description>

      <title>High-resolution direct phase control in the spectral domain in ultrashort pulse lasers for pulse-shaping applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03135</link>

Abstract: Ultrafast laser systems, those with a pulse duration on the order of picoseconds or less, have enabled advancements in a wide variety of fields. Of particular interest to this work, these laser systems are the key component to many High Energy Density (HED) physics experiments. Despite this, previous studies on the shape of the laser pulse within the HED community have focused primarily on pulse duration due to the relationship between pulse duration and peak intensity, while leaving the femtosecond scale structure of the pulse shape largely unstudied. To broaden the variety of potential pulses available for study, a method of reliably adjusting the pulse shape at the femtosecond scale using sub-nanometer resolution Direct Phase Control has been developed. This paper examines the capabilities of this new method compared to more commonplace dispersion-based pulse shaping methods. It also will detail the capabilities of the core algorithm driving this technique when used in conjunction with the WIZZLER and DAZZLER instruments that are common in high intensity laser labs. Performance of the method and instrumentation is examined using data taken with a single shot FROG system. Finally, some discussion is given to possible applications on how the Direct Phase Control pulse shaping technique will be implemented in the future.</description>

      <title>Topological photonic crystal fibre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic crystal fibres (PCFs) are optical fibres that guide light using a modulated dielectric medium. They provide an exceptionally versatile platform for various applications, thanks to the flexibility with which light-guiding can be customised by modifying the fibre geometry. Here, we realise a PCF with guided modes produced by photonic bandstructure topology rather than conventional mode-trapping mechanisms. The design, which is compatible with the stack-and-draw fabrication process, consists of a cross-sectional photonic topological crystalline insulator with a disclination. A bulk-defect correspondence produces degenerate topological modes, lying below the cladding light line. We use various theoretical methods to confirm their topological origins, including a spectral localiser that makes minimal assumptions about the bandstructure. Our experiments on the fabricated topological fibre show it transmitting visible to near-infrared light with low losses of 10--20 dB/km, which do not increase much when the fibre is bent. A comparable solid-core PCF of conventional design exhibits substantially higher bending losses. Optical fibres based on topological modes thus hold promise for improved performance and novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>Sample Motion for Structured Illumination Fluorescence Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) uses a set of images captured with different illumination patterns to computationally reconstruct resolution beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we propose an alternative approach using a single speckle illumination pattern and relying on inherent sample motion to encode the super-resolved information in multiple raw images. From a set of raw fluorescence images captured as the sample moves, we jointly estimate both the sample motion and the super-resolved image. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method both in simulation and in experiment.</description>

Abstract: A density matrix formalism is employed to calculate the emission of multi-level excitonic system, highlighting picosecond-scale dynamics and coherent effects such as quantum beats. The results are compared with recent experimental results and indicate some directions of further study. In particular, the effect of Rydberg blockade on the quantum beat phenomenon is discussed.</description>
