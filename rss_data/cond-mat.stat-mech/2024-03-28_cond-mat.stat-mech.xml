      <title>Critical Slowing Down in a Real Physical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of a dynamical system can exhibit abrupt changes when it crosses a tipping point. To prevent catastrophic events, it is useful to analyze indicators of the incoming bifurcation, as the divergence of the relaxation time of the system when approaching the critical point. However, this phenomenon, called critical slowing down (CSD), is hardly measurable in real physical systems. In this paper we provide experimental evidence of CSD in a laser system crossing the emission threshold and we analyze how it is affected by a time changing parameter and by noise.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the stochastic SIR model on random bond-diluted lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of bond-dilution disorder on the critical behavior of the stochastic SIR model. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted using square lattices with first- and second-nearest neighbor interactions. Quenched bond-diluted lattice disorder was introduced into the systems, allowing them to evolve over time. By employing percolation theory and finite-size scaling analysis, we estimate both the critical threshold and leading critical exponent ratios of the model for different bond-dilution rates ($p$). An examination of the average size of the percolating cluster and the size distribution of non-percolating clusters of recovered individuals was performed to ascertain the universality class of the model. The simulation results strongly indicate that the present model belongs to a new universality class distinct from that of 2D dynamical percolation, depending on the specific $p$ value under consideration.</description>

      <title>Random interfaces generated by the addition of structures of variable size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the random deposition of objects of variable width and height over a line. The successive additions of these structures create a random interface. We focus on the regime of heavy tailed distributions of the structure width. When the structure center is chosen at random, the problem is exactly solvable and we prove that the interfaces generically tend towards self-affine random curves. The asymptotic behavior reached after a large number of iterations is universal in the sense that it depends on only three parameters: the shape of the added structure at its maximum, the power-law exponent of the width distribution and the exponent that relates height and width. The parameter space displays several transitions that separate different asymptotic behaviors. In particular for a set of parameters, the interface tends towards a fractional Brownian motion. Our results reveal the existence of a new class of random interfaces which properties appear to be robust. The mechanism that generates correlations at large distance is identified and it explains the appearance of such correlations in several situations of interest such as the physics of earthquakes or the propagation of energy through a diffusive medium.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the collinearity in short-range order parameters for lattice configurations arising from topological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multicomponent lattice problems, e.g., in alloys, and at crystalline surfaces and interfaces, atomic arrangements exhibit spatial correlations that dictate the kinetic and thermodynamic phase behavior. These correlations emerge from interparticle interactions and are frequently reported in terms of the short-range order (SRO) parameter. Expressed usually in terms of pair distributions and other cluster probabilities, the SRO parameter gives the likelihood of finding atoms/molecules of a particular type in the vicinity of others atoms. This study focuses on fundamental constraints involving the SRO parameters that are imposed by the underlying lattice topology. Using a data-driven approach, we uncover the interrelationships between different SRO parameters (e.g., pairs, triplets, quadruplets, etc.) on a lattice. The main finding is that while some SRO parameters are independent, the remaining are collinear, i.e., the latter are dictated by the independent ones through linear relationships. A kinetic and thermodynamic modeling framework based on these constraints is introduced.</description>

      <title>Specificity of $\tau$ -- approximation for chaotic electron trajectories on complex Fermi surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work examines a special behavior of the magnetic conductivity of metals that arises when chaotic electron trajectories appear on the Fermi surface. This behavior is due to the scattering of electrons at singular points of the dynamic system describing the dynamics of electrons in $\, {\bf p}$-space, and caused by small-angle scattering of electrons on phonons. In this situation, the electronic system is described by a "non-standard" relaxation time, which plays the main role in a certain range of temperature and magnetic field values.</description>

      <title>Uphill drift in the absence of current in single-file diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-file diffusion is a paradigmatic model for the transport of Brownian colloidal particles in narrow one-dimensional channels, such as those found in certain porous media, where the particles cannot cross each other. We consider a system where a different external uniform potential is present to the right and left of an origin. For example, this is the case when two channels meeting at the origin have different radii. In equilibrium, the chemical potential of the particles are equal, the density is thus lower in the region with the higher potential, and by definition there is no net current in the system. Remarkably, a single-file tracer particle initially located at the origin, with position denoted by $Y(t)$, exhibits an average {\em up-hill} drift toward the region of {\em highest} potential. This drift has the late time behavior $\langle Y(t)\rangle= C t^{1/4}$, where the prefactor $C$ depends on the initial particle arrangement. This surprising result is shown analytically by computing the first two moments of $Y(t)$ through a simple and physically-illuminating method, and also via extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Building defect conformal field theory from the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$-function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics of 1d short-range Riesz gases in confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the full counting statistics (FCS) of a harmonically confined 1d short-range Riesz gas consisting of $N$ particles in equilibrium at finite temperature. The particles interact with each other through a repulsive power-law interaction with an exponent $k&gt;1$ which includes the Calogero-Moser model for $k=2$. We examine the probability distribution of the number of particles in a finite domain $[-W, W]$ called number distribution, denoted by $\mathcal{N}(W, N)$. We analyze the probability distribution of $\mathcal{N}(W, N)$ and show that it exhibits a large deviation form for large $N$ characterised by a speed $N^{\frac{3k+2}{k+2}}$ and by a large deviation function of the fraction $c = \mathcal{N}(W, N)/N$ of the particles inside the domain and $W$. We show that the density profiles that create the large deviations display interesting shape transitions as one varies $c$ and $W$. This is manifested by a third-order phase transition exhibited by the large deviation function that has discontinuous third derivatives. Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations show good agreement with our analytical expressions for the corresponding density profiles. We find that the typical fluctuations of $\mathcal{N}(W, N)$, obtained from our field theoretic calculations are Gaussian distributed with a variance that scales as $N^{\nu_k}$, with $\nu_k = (2-k)/(2+k)$. We also present some numerical findings on the mean and the variance. Furthermore, we adapt our formalism to study the index distribution (where the domain is semi-infinite $(-\infty, W])$, linear statistics (the variance), thermodynamic pressure and bulk modulus.</description>

      <title>Universality classes for percolation models with long-range correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of percolation models where the local occupation variables have long-range correlations decaying as a power law $\sim r^{-a}$ at large distances $r$, for some $0&lt; a&lt; d$ where $d$ is the underlying spatial dimension. For several of these models, we present both, rigorous analytical results and matching simulations that determine the critical exponents characterizing the fixed point associated to their phase transition, which is of second order. The exact values we obtain are rational functions of the two parameters $a$ and $d$ alone, and do not depend on the specifics of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium rate theories play a crucial role in understanding rare, reactive events. However, they are inapplicable to a range of irreversible processes in systems driven far from thermodynamic equilibrium like active and biological matter. Here, we develop a general, computationally efficient nonequilibrium rate theory in the weak-noise limit based on an instanton approximation to the stochastic path integral and illustrate its wide range of application in the study of rare nonequilibrium events. We demonstrate excellent agreement of the instanton rates with numerically exact results for a particle under a non-conservative force. We also study phase transitions in an active field theory. We elucidate how activity alters the stability of the two phases and their rates of interconversion in a manner that can be well-described by modifying classical nucleation theory</description>

      <title>Typical thermalization of low-entanglement states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proving thermalization from the unitary evolution of a closed quantum system is one of the oldest questions that is still nowadays only partially resolved. Several efforts have led to various formulations of what is called the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The latter, however, assume initial states which are highly concentrated around a specific energy window and, as such, cannot account for a large class of states that are of paramount importance and that are operationally accessible in natural physical settings, including many experimental schemes for testing thermalization and for quantum simulation: low-entanglement states. In this work, we prove thermalization of these states under precise conditions that have operational significance. More specifically, we define a random energy smoothing - motivated by arguments of unavoidable finite resolution - on local Hamiltonians that lead to local thermalization when the initial state has low entanglement. Finally we show that such transformation affects neither the Gibbs state locally nor, under a mild condition, the short time dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We describe a novel algorithm that recovers the Hamiltonian and temperature of a quantum state in thermal equilibrium using a restricted set of measurements. The algorithm works by imposing a semidefinite constraint based on free energy minimization, which we interpret in terms of thermodynamic stability. We benchmark the algorithm on the problem of learning a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 100-qubit spin chain.</description>

Abstract: The problem of quantum scalar field evolution after an instantaneous local perturbation (quench) is considered. A new approach to descriptions of a quench from an arbitrary initial state is developed in the framework of the Keldysh technique. This approach does not require the procedure of the analytical continuation, which can be ambiguous in some cases. The evolution of the energy density after local quench is calculated for a simple case, and its dependence on the interaction region width and the initial conditions is analysed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between tagged particles and size-biased empirical processes in interacting particle systems, in analogy to classical results on the propagation of chaos. In a mean-field scaling limit, the evolution of the occupation number on the tagged particle site converges to a time-inhomogeneous Markov process with non-linear master equation given by the law of large numbers of size-biased empirical measures. The latter are important in recent efforts to understand the dynamics of condensation in interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states (VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data. The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from stringlet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids for which no theory or fundamental understanding is available. We derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier representing a crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula correctly recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are supported by comparisons with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids, which confirm that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.</description>

      <title>Thermalization condition for non-Hermitian quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to non-Hermitian quantum systems has become one of the most important topics in dissipative quantum chaos, recently giving rise to intense debates. The process of thermalization is intricate, involving many time-evolution trajectories in the reduced Hilbert space of the system. By considering two different expansion forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time evolutions, we have derived two versions of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively. This finding implies that the recently proposed biorthogonal random matrix theory needs an appropriate revision. Moreover, we have exemplified the precise dynamics of thermalization and thermodynamic properties with test models.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>

Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand et al., arXiv:2306.11457] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it quantitatively describes the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic singularity in the density four-point function of two-dimensional critical percolation in the bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide definitive proof of the logarithmic nature of the percolation conformal field theory in the bulk by showing that the four-point function of the density operator has a logarithmic divergence as two points collide and that the same divergence appears in the operator product expansion (OPE) of two density operators. The right hand side of the OPE contains two operators with the same scaling dimension, one of them multiplied by a term with a logarithmic singularity. Our method involves a probabilistic analysis of the percolation events contributing to the four-point function. It does not require algebraic considerations, nor taking the $Q \to 1$ limit of the $Q$-state Potts model, and is amenable to a rigorous mathematical formulation. The logarithmic divergence appears as a consequence of scale invariance combined with independence.</description>

      <title>Spectral line shape in the limit of frequent velocity-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The speed-dependent spectral line profiles collapse into a simple Lorentz profile in the regime dominated by the velocity-changing collisions. We derive general formulas for the effective width and shift of the Lorentzian for arbitrary speed-dependent collisional broadening and shift and velocity-changing collision operators. For a quadratic speed dependence of collisional broadening and shift, and the billiard ball model of velocity-changing collisions, we provide simple analytical expressions for the effective Lorentzian width and shift. We show that the effective Lorentzian width and shift split into components originating from the: well-known Dicke-narrowed Doppler width, speed-averaged collisional broadening and shift, their speed dependencies, and a product term that mixes the contributions of the broadening and shift speed dependencies. We show how the components depend on rates of speed-changing and velocity-changing collisions related to the perturber/absorber mass ratio. We validate analytical formulas numerically on example of H$_{2}$ transition perturbed by He.</description>

      <title>When correlations exceed system size: finite-size scaling in free boundary conditions above the upper critical dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We progress finite-size scaling in systems with free boundary conditions above their upper critical dimension, where in the thermodynamic limit critical scaling is described by mean-field theory. Recent works show that the correlation length is not bound by the system's physical size, a belief that long held sway. Instead, two scaling regimes can be observed - at the critical and pseudo-critical temperatures. We demonstrate that both are manifest for free boundaries. We use numerical simulations of the $d=5$ Ising model to analyse the magnetization, susceptibility, magnetization Fourier modes and the partition function zeros. While some of the response functions hide the dual finite-size scaling, the precision enabled by the analysis of Lee-Yang zeros allows this be brought to the fore. In particular, finite-size scaling of leading zeros at the pseudo-critical point confirms recent predictions coming from correlations exceeding the system size. This paper is dedicated to Jaroslav Ilnytskyi on the occasion of his 60th birthday.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Quantum Chaos and Anomalous Relaxation in Open Quantum Circuits</title>

Abstract: Dissipation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature that affects the fate of chaotic quantum dynamics. To characterize the interplay between quantum chaos and dissipation in generic quantum many-body systems, we consider a minimal dissipative Floquet many-body circuit. In particular, we study the dissipative form factor (DFF), an extension of the spectral form factor to open quantum systems, of Floquet systems in the presence of arbitrary on-site dissipation modeled by quantum channels. For a solvable model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension, we obtain an exact expression for the DFF averaged over the random unitary gates, with simple, closed-form expressions in the limit of large times. We find that, for long enough times, the system always relaxes (i.e., the DFF decays) with two distinctive regimes characterized by the presence or absence of gap-closing. While the system can sustain a robust ramp for a long (but finite) time interval in the gap-closing regime, relaxation is "assisted" by quantum chaos in the regime where the gap remains nonzero. In the latter regime, we find that, if the thermodynamic limit is taken first, the gap does not close even in the dissipationless limit, a recently uncovered phenomenon dubbed anomalous relaxation. We complement our findings with numerical results for quantum circuits with a small Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Predictive Theories through Integrating Quantum, Statistical, Equilibrium, and Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Today's thermodynamics is largely based on the combined law for equilibrium systems and statistical mechanics derived by Gibbs in 1873 and 1901, respectively, while irreversible thermodynamics for nonequilibrium systems resides essentially on the Onsager Theorem as a separate branch of thermodynamics developed in 1930s. Between them, quantum mechanics was invented and was quantitatively solved in terms of density functional theory (DFT) in 1960s. These three scientific domains operate based on different principles and are very much separated from each other. In analogy to the parable of the blind men and the elephant articulated by Perdew, they individually represent different portions of a complex system and thus are incomplete by themselves alone, resulting in the lack of quantitative agreement between their predictions and experimental observations. Over the last two decades, the author's group has developed a multiscale entropy approach (recently termed as zentropy theory) that integrates DFT-based quantum mechanics and Gibbs statistical mechanics and is capable of accurately predicting entropy and free energy of complex systems. Furthermore, in combination with the combined law for nonequilibrium systems developed by Hillert, the author developed the theory of cross phenomena beyond the phenomenological Onsager Theorem. The zentropy theory and theory of cross phenomena jointly provide quantitative predictive theories for experimental observables as reviewed in the present work.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundary Modes in Nonlinear Dynamics with Chiral Symmetry</title>

Abstract: Particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry play a pivotal role in multiple areas of physics, yet they remain unstudied in systems with nonlinear interactions whose nonlinear normal modes do not exhibit $\textbf{U}(1)$-gauge symmetry. In this work, we establish particle-hole symmetry and chiral symmetry in such systems. Chiral symmetry ensures the quantization of the Berry phase of nonlinear normal modes and categorizes the topological phases of nonlinear dynamics. We show topologically protected static boundary modes in chiral-symmetric nonlinear systems. Our theoretical framework extends particle-hole and chiral symmetries to nonlinear dynamics, whose nonlinear modes do not necessarily yield $\textbf{U}(1)$-gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-lying entanglement spectrum provides the quintessential fingerprint to identify the highly entangled quantum matter with topological and conformal field-theoretical properties. However, when the entangling region acquires long boundary with the environment, such as that between long coupled chains or in two or higher dimensions, there unfortunately exists no universal yet practical method to compute the entanglement spectra with affordable computational cost. Here we propose a new scheme to overcome such difficulty and successfully extract the low-lying fine entanglement spectrum (ES). We trace out the environment via quantum Monte Carlo simulation and diagonalize the reduced density matrix to gain the ES. We demonstrate the strength and reliability of our method through long coupled spin chains and answer its long-standing controversy. Our simulation results, with unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish the practical computation scheme of the entanglement spectrum with a huge freedom degree of environment.</description>
