      <title>Approximate Noether symmetries of perturbed Lagrangians and approximate conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, within the framework of the consistent approach recently introduced for approximate Lie symmetries of differential equations, we consider approximate Noether symmetries of variational problems involving small terms. Then, we state an approximate Noether theorem leading to the construction of approximate conservation laws. Some illustrative applications are presented.</description>

      <title>Through and beyond moments, entropies and Fisher information measures: new informational functionals and inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new classes of informational functionals, called \emph{upper moments}, respectively \emph{down-Fisher measures}, obtained by applying classical functionals such as $p$-moments and the Fisher information to the recently introduced up or down transformed probability density functions. We extend some of the the most important informational inequalities to our new functionals and establish optimal constants and minimizers for them. In particular, we highlight that, under certain constraints, the generalized Beta probability density maximizes (or minimizes) the upper-moments when the moment is fixed. Moreover, we apply these structured inequalities to systematically establish new and sharp upper bounds for the main classical informational products such as moment-entropy, Stam, or Cram\'er-Rao like products under certain regularity conditions. Other relevant properties, such as regularity under scaling changes or monotonicity with respect to the parameter, are studied. Applications to related problems to the Hausdorff moment problem are also given.</description>

      <title>A Correlational Bound for Eigenvalues of Fermionic 2-Body Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the eigenvalues of a 2-body operator $\gamma_{2}^{\Psi}$ associated to a fermionic $N$-particle state $\Psi$ are highly constrained by the structure of the corresponding eigenvectors: If $\Phi=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{k}u_{k}\wedge v_{k}$ is the canonical form of an eigenvector $\Phi$ with eigenvalue $\Lambda$, then $\Lambda\leq(1+\frac{N-2}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\lambda_{k}^{4})^{-1}N$. We also prove a lower bound on $\sup_{\Vert \Psi\Vert =1}\langle \Phi,\gamma_{2}^{\Psi}\Phi\rangle$ for fixed $\Phi$, and state a conjecture motivated by these results.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal performance of square-root measurement for general score functions and quantum ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barnum-Knill theorem states that the optimal success probability in the multiple state discrimination task is not more than the square root of the success probability when the pretty good or square-root measurement is used for this task. An assumption of the theorem is that the underlying ensemble consists of finitely many quantum states over a finite-dimensional quantum system. Motivated in part by the fact that the success probability is not a relevant metric for continuous ensembles, in this paper we provide a generalization of the notion of pretty good measurement and the Barnum-Knill theorem for general quantum ensembles, including those described by a continuous parameter space and an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To achieve this, we also design a general metric of performance for quantum measurements that generalizes the success probability, namely, the expected gain of the measurement with respect to a positive score function. A notable consequence of the main result is that, in a Bayesian estimation task, the mean square error of the generalized pretty good measurement does not exceed twice the optimal mean square error.</description>

      <title>All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous quantization of the Yang-Mills gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Conserved Quantities in the Lorenz System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorenz system, a seminal model in chaos theory, is renowned for its complex dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This work investigates conserved quantities within the standard Lorenz equations. The system exhibits phase space volume contraction, a characteristic of dissipative systems. Despite the common understanding suggesting an absence of conserved quantities in its typical chaotic parameter regimes, this study demonstrates that the Lorenz system possesses at least three dynamical constants of motion. Implications of these conserved quantities for the system's chaotic behavior are discussed.</description>

      <title>LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, in order to be sure that unitarity is not violated, one should derived the LSZ rules for the model and check the absence of negative contributions to the $S$ matrix. In addition, the derivation of the LSZ rules is of interest, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks. This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>

      <title>Integrable Non-Holonomic Constraints and Gauge Fixing in Classical Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the usual derivation of the equations of motion for a classical field theory with non-holonomic constraints, constraints that depend on the derivatives of the field, fails. As a result, the usual method for gauge fixing in classical and quantum field theories fails for general gauges that depend on the derivatives of the fields, such as the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges. The point of failure occurs at the use of the transposition rule, $\delta(\partial_\nu A^\mu)=\partial_\nu(\delta A^\mu)$, in the derivation of the equations of motion from the extremization of the action; we show that the transposition rule does not hold for general non-holonomic constraints. We define the concept of integrability of non-holonomic constraints in field theory and prove that the usual transposition rule holds for theories with these constraints. We are thus able to recover the usual treatment of gauge fixing for gauges of this type. We apply our formalism to the specific examples of the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges.</description>

      <title>Construction of Metaplectic Representations of $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ and Twisted Magnetic Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary metaplectic representations of the group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ are necessary to describe the evolution of $2^n$-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. We construct the general matrix form of such representations, together with appropriately defined magnetic translations based on the diagonal subgroup of the tensor product of the finite Heisenberg group $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n$-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary.</description>

      <title>Factorization of positive definite kernels. Correspondences: $C^{*}$-algebraic and operator valued context vs scalar valued kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a class $\mathcal{M}$ of generalized positive definite kernels of the form $K\colon X\times X\to L(\mathfrak{A},L(H))$, where $\mathfrak{A}$ is a unital $C^{*}$-algebra and $H$ a Hilbert space. These kernels encode operator-valued correlations governed by the algebraic structure of $\mathfrak{A}$, and generalize classical scalar-valued positive definite kernels, completely positive (CP) maps, and states on $C^{*}$-algebras. Our approach is based on a scalar-valued kernel $\tilde{K}\colon(X\times\mathfrak{A}\times H)^{2}\to\mathbb{C}$ associated to $K$, which defines a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and enables a concrete, representation-theoretic analysis of the structure of such kernels. We show that every $K\in\mathcal{M}$ admits a Stinespring-type factorization $K(s,t)(a)=V(s)^{*}\pi(a)V(t)$. In analogy with the Radon--Nikodym theory for CP maps, we characterize kernel domination $K\leq L$ in terms of a positive operator $A\in\pi_{L}(\mathfrak{A})'$ satisfying $K(s,t)(a)=V_{L}(s)^{*}\pi_{L}(a)AV_{L}(t)$. We further show that when $\pi_{L}$ is irreducible, domination implies scalar proportionality, thus recovering the classical correspondence between pure states and irreducible representations.</description>

      <title>More on Slavnov Products of Spin Chains and KP Hierarchy Tau Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connections between classical and quantum integrable systems are analyzed from the viewpoint of Slavnov products of Bethe states. It is well known that, modulo model dependent aspects, the functional structure of Slavnov products generally takes the form of determinants. Building on recent results on the structure of rational and trigonometric models, we show that, provided certain conditions are satisfied, the Slavnov product of a given model can be interpreted as a tau function of the KP hierarchy, thus extending known results in a more general setting. Moreover, we show that Slavnov products can be expanded in terms of other tau functions. We also prove that their homogeneous limit can be systematically expressed as a Wronskian of functions related to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices. Finally, we compute the Baker-Akhiezer functions associated with these Slavnov products and show that, apart from a universal multiplicative factor, they admit a closed determinantal representation.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian with Energy Levels Corresponding to Riemann Zeros</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian with eigenvalues $E_n = \rho_n(1-\rho_n) $ has been constructed, where $\rho_n $ denotes the $n-$th non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function. To construct such a Hamiltonian, we generalize the Berry-Keating's paradigm and encode number-theoretic information into the Hamiltonian through modular forms. Even though our construction does not resolve the Hilbert-P\'olya conjecture -- since the eigenstates corresponding to $E_n$ are \emph{not} normalizable states -- it offers a novel physical perspective on the Riemann Hypothesis(RH). Especially, we proposed a physical statement of RH, which may serve as a potential pathway toward its proof.</description>

      <title>Fisher information from quantum many-particle arrival time measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a quantum arrival time measurement process for a Bosonic many-particle system, with the aim of extracting statistical information on single-particle properties. The arrival time is based on a dynamical multi-particle absorption model in the Fock space, and we consider systems in coherent and incoherent mixtures of $N$-particle states. We find the resulting probability distributions for arrival time sequences, which we consider as parametric models for the statistical inference of single-particle parameters, and derive a tractable expression for the associated (classical) Fisher information. Subsequently focusing on the concrete case of the momentum parameter of a 1D particle, we consider the idealized limits of a point (Dirac delta) detector and an infinite particle system forming a spatially uniform ``beam''. We observe that even though no information remains in the spatial distribution, the single-particle momentum is indeed identifiable from the arrival time data, even in the limit of ``sparse beams'' of vanishing particle density, where we obtain simple analytical form for the Fisher information, which, interestingly, coincides with the one obtained from a hypothetical time-stationary detection model. Our results contribute to the fundamental understanding of temporal measurement data arising from quantum systems consisting of freely evolving particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present definitive violations of non-contextual hidden variable bounds in the latest generation of IBM noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers (NISQ). These violations are based on known tests for contextuality such as the Rio Negro inequality and pseudo-telepathic Mermin games. These are the first violations of the classical Mermin game on IBM NISQ computers, and the largest such violations for the Rio Negro inequality. The use of finite geometries proves instrumental in the development of more effective tests, with larger geometries providing sizeable datasets from which multiple distinct experiments can be compared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach to Carrollian geometry using principal $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$) equipped with a degenerate metric whose kernel is the module of vertical vector fields. The constructions allow for non-trivial bundles and a large class of Carrollian manifolds can be analysed in this formalism. Alongside other results, we show that once an $\mathbb{R}^\times$-connection has been chosen, there is a canonical affine connection that is torsionless, but, in general, not compatible with the degenerate metric. The construction of an affine connection is intimately tied to a Kaluza-Klein geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a refined definition of the class of random matrix ensembles introduced in our paper "Structured random matrices and cyclic cumulants: A free probability approach" (arXiv:2309.14315) by extending the so-called fourth axiom to deal with cumulants of disjoint cycles. We argue that the theorems concerning the stability of such ensembles under non-linear transformations still hold with these refined axioms.</description>

      <title>A Hyperbolic Approximation of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a first-order hyperbolic approximation of
  the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation. We show that the system
  is strictly hyperbolic and possesses a modified Hamiltonian structure, along with
  at least three conserved quantities that approximate those of NLS.
  We provide families of explicit standing-wave solutions to the hyperbolic system,
  which are shown to converge uniformly to ground-state solutions
  of NLS in the relaxation limit.
  The system is formally equivalent to NLS in the relaxation limit, and we
  develop asymptotic preserving discretizations that tend to a consistent discretization
  of NLS in that limit, while also conserving mass.
  Examples for both the focusing and defocusing regimes demonstrate that the
  numerical discretization provides an accurate approximation of the NLS
  solution.</description>

      <title>Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact solutions of quantum deficient oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process, to which exact distribution and correlation functions are constructed by utilising the correspondence between diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators, based on which this article constructs a new class of exact solutions in stochastic inflation. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactly solvable double-well model is also presented. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>On the Modulation of Wave Trains in the Ostrovsky Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear wave modulation of arbitrary amplitude periodic traveling wave solutions of the Ostrovsky equation, which arises as a model for the unidirectional propagation of small-amplitude, weakly nonlinear surface and internal gravity waves in a rotating fluid of finite depth. While the modulation of such waves with asymptotically small amplitudes of oscillation (the so-called Stokes waves) has been studied in several works, our goal is to understand the modulational dynamics of general amplitude wave trains. To this end, we first use Whitham's theory of modulations to derive a dispersionless system of quasilinear partial differential equations that is expected to model the slow evolution of the fundamental characteristics of a given wave train. In practice, the modulational stability or instability of a given wave train is considered to be determined by the hyperbolicity or ellipticity, respectively, of the resulting system of Whitham modulation equations. Using rigorous spectral perturbation theory we then study the spectral (linearized) stability problem for a given wave train solution of the Ostrovsky equation, directly connecting the hyperbolicity or ellipticity of the associated Whitham system to the rigorous spectral stability problem for the underlying wave. Specifically, we prove that strict hyperbolicity of the Whitham system implies spectral stability near the origin in the spectral plane, i.e. so-called spectral modulational stability, while ellipticity implies spectral instability of the underlying wave train.</description>

Abstract: Spectral decomposition with respect to the wave functions of Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system defines an integral transform, which generalizes classical Fourier integral. For a certain class of analytical symmetric functions we prove inversion formula and orthogonality relations, valid for complex valued parameters of the system. Besides, we study four regimes of unitarity, when this transform defines isomorphisms of the corresponding $L_2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>The grammar of the Ising model: A new complexity hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How complex is an Ising model? Usually, this is measured by the computational complexity of its ground state energy problem. Yet, this complexity measure only distinguishes between planar and non-planar interaction graphs, and thus fails to capture properties such as the average node degree, the number of long range interactions, or the dimensionality of the lattice. Herein, we introduce a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models with respect to it. Specifically, given an Ising model we consider the decision problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this decision problem is (i) regular if and only if the Ising model is finite, (ii) constructive context free if and only if the Ising model is linear and its edge language is regular, (iii) constructive context sensitive if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is context sensitive, and (iv) decidable if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is decidable. We apply this theorem to show that the 1d Ising model, the Ising model on generalised ladder graphs, and the Ising model on layerwise complete graphs are constructive context free, while the 2d Ising model, the all-to-all Ising model, and the Ising model on perfect binary trees are constructive context sensitive. This work is a first step in the characterisation of physical interactions in terms of grammars.</description>

      <title>Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for Enhancing Fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.</description>

      <title>Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>1d Ising model with $1/r^{1.99}$ interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A phenomenon of "algebraic self-similarity" on 3d cubic lattice, providing what can be called an algebraic analogue of Kadanoff--Wilson theory, is shown to possess a 4d version as well. Namely, if there is a $4\times 4$ matrix $A$ whose entries are indeterminates over the field $\mathbb F_2$, then the $2\times 2\times 2\times 2$ block made of sixteen copies of $A$ reveals the existence of four direct "block spin" summands corresponding to the same matrix $A$. Moreover, these summands can be written out in quite an elegant way. Somewhat strikingly, if the entries of $A$ are just zeros and ones -- elements of $\mathbb F_2$ -- then there are examples where two more "block spins" split out, and this time with different $A$'s.</description>

Abstract: Negative refractive index materials have attracted significant research attention due to their unique electromagnetic response characteristics. In this paper, we employ the complementing boundary condition to establish rigorous a priori estimates for the Helmholtz equation, from which the limiting absorption principle is analytically derived. Within this mathematical framework, we conclusively establish the well-posedness of the electromagnetic transmission problem at the interface between conventional materials and negative refractive index materials in two-dimensional periodic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a $(1+1)$-dimensional semi-discrete random variational problem that can be interpreted as the geometrically linearized version of the critical $2$-dimensional random field Ising model. The scaling of the correlation length of the latter was recently characterized in [12] and [13, Section 5]; our analysis is reminiscent of the multi-scale approach of the latter work and of [20]. We show that at every dyadic scale from the system size down to the lattice spacing the minimizer contains at most order-one Dirichlet energy per unit length. We also establish a quenched homogenization result in the sense that the leading order of the minimal energy becomes deterministic as the ratio system size / lattice spacing diverges. To this purpose we adapt arguments from [9] on the $(d+1)$-dimensional version our the model, with a Brownian replacing the white noise potential, to obtain the initial large-scale bounds. Based on our estimate of the $(p=3)$-Dirichlet energy, we give an informal justification of the geometric linearization. Our bounds, which are oblivious to the microscopic cut-off scale provided by the lattice spacing, yield tightness of the law of minimizers in the space of continuous functions as the lattice spacing is sent to zero.</description>

      <title>Kuramoto meets Koopman: Constants of motion, symmetries, and network motifs</title>

Abstract: The partial integrability of the Kuramoto model is often thought to be restricted to identically connected oscillators or groups thereof. Yet, the exact connectivity prerequisites for having constants of motion on more general graphs have remained elusive. Using spectral properties of the Koopman generator, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of distinct constants of motion in the Kuramoto model with heterogeneous phase lags on any weighted, directed, signed graph. This reveals a broad class of network motifs that support conserved quantities. Furthermore, we identify Lie symmetries that generate new constants of motion. Our results provide a rigorous theoretical application of Koopman's framework to nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.</description>

      <title>Classical Dirac particle I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we produce a classical Lagrangian description of an elementary spinning particle which satisfies Dirac equation when quantized. We call this particle a classical Dirac particle. We analyze in detail the way we arrive to this model and how the different observables and constants of the motion can be expressed in terms of the degrees of freedom and their derivatives, by making use of Noether's theorem. The main feature is that the particle has a center of charge r, moving at the speed of light, that satisfies fourth-order diferential equations and all observables can be expressed only in terms of this point and their time derivatives. The particle has also a center of mass q, that is a different point than the center of charge. This implies that two different spin observables can be defined, one S with respect to the point r and another SCM with respect to the point q, that satisfy different dynamical equations. The spin S satisfies the same dynamical equation than Dirac's spin operator. The fourth-order differential equations for the point r can be transformed into a system of second-order ordinary differential equations for the center of charge and center of mass. The dynamics can be described in terms of dimensionless variables. The possible interaction Lagrangians are described and we devote the main part of the work to the electromagnetic interaction of the Dirac particle with uniform and oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The numerical integrations of the dynamical equations are performed with different Mathematica notebooks that are available for the interested reader.</description>
