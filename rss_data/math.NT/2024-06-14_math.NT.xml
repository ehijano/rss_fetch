      <description>arXiv:2406.08565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new elementary proof of Landau's Prime Ideal Theorem. The proof is an extension of Richter's proof of the Prime Number Theorem. The main result contains other results related to the equidistribution of the prime ideal counting function.</description>

      <title>Integral representation and approximation of L-functions associated to Hecke cusp eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a family of approximations for L-functions of Hecke cusp eigenforms, according to a recipe first described by Matiyasevich for the Riemann xi function. We show that these approximations converge to the true L-function, and along the way we demonstrate error formulas which may be used to investigate analytic properties of the L-function and its derivatives. Together with the Euler product expansion of the L-function, the family of approximations also encodes some of the key features of the L-function such as its functional equation. Finally, we derive via Mellin transforms a convolution-type formula which leads to precise error bounds in terms of the incomplete gamma function. This formula can be interpreted as an alternative definition for the approximation and sheds light on Matiyasevich's procedure.</description>

      <title>The Steinitz Realization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and let $n \in \ZZ_{&gt;1}$. The \emph{Steinitz realization problem} asks: does every element of $\Cl(K)$ occur as the Steinitz class of a degree $n$ extension of $K$? In this article, we give an affirmative answer to the Steinitz realization problem for all $n$ and $K$.</description>

      <title>On the number of zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the number of zeros $\varrho=\beta+i\gamma$ of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ with $0&lt;\gamma\le T$ is given by \[N(T)=\frac{T}{4\pi}\log\frac{T}{2\pi}-\frac{T}{4\pi}-\frac12\sqrt{\frac{T}{2\pi}}+O(T^{2/5}\log^2 T).\] Here $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ is the function that Siegel found in Riemann's papers. Siegel related the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ to the zeros of Riemann's zeta function. Our result on $N(T)$ improves the result of Siegel.</description>

      <title>Generation of cyclotomic Hecke fields by $L$-values of cusp forms on $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ with certain $\mathbb{Z}_p$ twist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a number field, $f$ an algebraic automorphic newform on $\mathrm{GL}(2)$ over $F$, $p$ an odd prime does not divide the class number of $F$ and the level of $f$. We prove that $f$ is determined by its $L$-values twisted by Galois characters $\phi$ of certain $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$. Furthermore, if $F$ is totally real or CM, then under some mild assumption on $f$, the compositum of the Hecke field of $f$ and the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\phi)$ is generated by the algebraic $L$-values of $f$ twisted by Galois characters $\phi$ of certain $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of the growth rate of digits in Schneider's $p$-adic continued fraction dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}_p$ be the ring of $p$-adic integers and $a_n(x)$ be the $n$-th digit of Schneider's $p$-adic continued fraction of $x\in p\mathbb{Z}_p$. We study the growth rate of the digits $\{a_n(x)\}_{n\geq1}$ from the viewpoint of multifractal analysis. The Hausdorff dimension of the set \[E_{\sup}(\psi)=\Big\{x\in p\mathbb{Z}_p:\ \limsup\limits_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_n(x)}{\psi(n)}=1\Big\}\] is completely determined for any $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}$ satisfying $\psi(n)\to \infty$ as $n\to\infty$. As an application, we also calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection sets \[E^{\sup}_{\inf}(\psi,\alpha_1,\alpha_2)=\left\{x\in p\mathbb{Z}_p:\liminf_{n\rightarrow\infty}\dfrac{a_n(x)}{\psi(n)}=\alpha_1,~\limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\dfrac{a_n(x)}{\psi(n)}=\alpha_2\right\}\] for the above function $\psi$ and $0\leq\alpha_1&lt;\alpha_2\leq\infty$.</description>

      <title>Square-roots and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a point set in the Euclidean plane that elucidates the relationship between the fine-scale statistics of the fractional parts of $\sqrt n$ and directional statistics for a shifted lattice. We show that the randomly rotated, and then stretched, point set converges in distribution to a lattice-like random point process. This follows closely the arguments in Elkies and McMullen's original analysis for the gap statistics of $\sqrt{n}$ mod 1 in terms of random affine lattices [Duke Math. J. 123 (2004), 95-139]. There is, however, a curious subtlety: the limit process emerging in our construction is NOT invariant under the standard $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-action on $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial p-adic Low-Discrepancy Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic example of a low-discrepancy sequence in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $(x_n) = an+b$ with $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p^x$ and $b \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. Here we address the non-linear case and show that a polynomial $f$ generates a low-discrepancy sequence in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ if and only if it is a permutation polynomial $\mod p$ and $\mod p^2$. By this it is possible to construct non-linear examples of low-discrepancy sequences in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ for all primes $p$. Moreover, we prove a criterion which decides for any given polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ with $p \in \left\{ 3,5, 7\right\}$ if it generates a low-discrepancy sequence. We also discuss connections to the theories of Poissonian pair correlations and real discrepancy.</description>

      <title>On averages of completely multiplicative functions over co-prime integer pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Donoso, Le, Moreira and Sun studied the asymptotic behavior of the averages of completely multiplicative functions over the Gaussian integers. They derived Wirsing's theorem for Gaussian integers, answered a question of Frantzikinakis and Host for sum of two squares, and obtained a variant of a theorem of Bergelson and Richter on ergodic averages along the number of prime factors of integers. In this paper, we will show the analogue of these results for co-prime integer pairs. Moreover, building on Frantzikinakis and Host's results, we obtain some convergences on the multilinear averages of multiplicative functions over primitive lattice points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the asymptotic formula for the number of integral solutions to a system of diagonal equations. We obtain the asymptotic formula for the number of solutions with variables restricted to smooth numbers as well. We improve the required number of variables compared to previous results by incorporating the recent progress on Waring's problem and the resolution of Vinogradov's mean value theorem.</description>

      <title>On Arratia's coupling and the Dirichlet law for the factors of a random integer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x \ge 2$, let $N_x$ be an integer chosen uniformly at random from the set $\mathbb Z \cap [1, x]$, and let $(V_1, V_2, \ldots)$ be a Poisson--Dirichlet process of parameter $1$. We prove that there exists a coupling of these two random objects such that $$ \mathbb E \, \sum_{i \ge 1} |\log P_i- V_i\log x| \ll 1, $$ where the implied constant is absolute and $N_x = P_1P_2 \cdots$ is the unique factorization of $N_x$ into primes or ones with the $P_i$'s being non-increasing. This establishes a conjecture of Arratia (2002) arXiv:1305.0941 who proved that the right-hand side in the above estimate can be made $\ll \log\!\log x$. We also use this coupling to give a probabilistic proof of the Dirichlet law for the average distribution of the integer factorization into $k$ parts proved in 2023 by Leung arXiv:2206.14728 and we improve on its error term.</description>

      <title>On the existence of magic squares of powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $d \geq 2$, we prove that there exists an integer $n_0(d)$ such that there exists an $n \times n$ magic square of $d^\text{th}$ powers for all $n \geq n_0(d)$. In particular, we establish the existence of an $n \times n$ magic square of squares for all $n \geq 4$, which settles a conjecture of V\'{a}rilly-Alvarado.
  All previous approaches had been based on constructive methods and the existence of $n \times n$ magic squares of $d^\text{th}$ powers had only been known for sparse values of $n$. We prove our result by the Hardy-Littlewood circle method, which in this setting essentially reduces the problem to finding a sufficient number of disjoint linearly independent subsets of the columns of the coefficient matrix of the equations defining magic squares. We prove an optimal (up to a constant) lower bound for this quantity.</description>

      <title>The cancellation property for projective modules over integral group rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a partial classification of the finite groups $G$ for which the integral group ring $\mathbb{Z} G$ has projective cancellation, i.e. for which $P \oplus \mathbb{Z} G \cong Q \oplus \mathbb{Z} G$ implies $P \cong Q$ for projective $\mathbb{Z} G$-modules $P$ and $Q$. To do this, we prove a cancellation theorem based on a relative version of the Eichler condition and use it to establish the cancellation property for a large class of finite groups. We then use a group theoretic argument to precisely determine the class of groups not covered by this result. The final classification is then obtained by applying results of Swan, Chen and Bley-Hofmann-Johnston which show failure of the cancellation property for certain groups.</description>

Abstract: We confirm the speculation that the distribution of $t$-hooks among unrestricted integer partitions essentially descends to self-conjugate partitions. Namely, we prove that the number of hooks of length $t$ among the size $n$ self-conjugate partitions is asymptotically normally distributed with mean
  $\mu_t(n) \sim \frac{\sqrt{6n}}{\pi} + \frac{3}{\pi^2} - \frac{t}{2}$ and variance $\sigma_t^2(n) \sim \frac{(\pi^2 - 6) \sqrt{6n}}{\pi^3}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a version of the sieve of Eratosthenes that can factor all integers $\le x$ in $O(x \log\log x)$ arithmetic operations using at most $O(\sqrt{x}/\log\log x)$ bits of space. This is an improved space bound under the condition that the algorithm takes at most $O(x\log\log x)$ time. We also show our algorithm performs well in practice.</description>

      <title>Davenport constant and its variants for some non-abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define two variants $e(G)$, $f(G)$ of the Davenport constant $d(G)$ of a finite group $G$, that is not necessarily abelian. These naturally arising constants aid in computing $d(G)$ and are of potential independent interest. We compute the constants $d(G)$, $e(G)$, $f(G)$ for some nonabelian groups G, and demonstrate that, unlike abelian groups where these constants are identical, they can each be distinct. As a byproduct of our results, we also obtain some cases of a conjecture of J. Bass. We compute the $k$-th Davenport constant for several classes of groups as well. We also make a conjecture on $f(G)$ for metacyclic groups and provide evidence towards it.</description>

      <title>Local Langlands in families: The banal case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We state a conjecture, local Langlands in families, connecting the centre of the category of smooth representations on $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$-modules of a quasi-split $p$-adic group $\mathrm{G}$ (where $q$ is the cardinality of the residue field of the underlying local field), the ring of global functions on the stack of Langlands parameters for $\mathrm{G}$ over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{q}^{-1}]$, and the endomorphisms of a Gelfand-Graev representation for $\mathrm{G}$. For a class of classical $p$-adic groups (symplectic, unitary, or split odd special orthogonal groups), we prove this conjecture after inverting an integer depending only on $\mathrm{G}$. Along the way, we show that the local Langlands correspondence for classical $p$-adic groups (1) preserves integrality of $\ell$-adic representations; (2) satisfies an "extended" (generic) packet conjecture; (3) is compatible with parabolic induction up to semisimplification (generalizing a result of Moussaoui), hence induces a semisimple local Langlands correspondence; and (4) the semisimple correspondence is compatible with automorphisms of $\mathbb{C}$ fixing $\sqrt{q}$.</description>

      <title>On the independence number of sparser random Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cayley sum graph $\Gamma_A$ of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$ is defined to have vertex set $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and an edge between two distinct vertices $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}_n$ if $x + y \in A$. Green and Morris proved that if the set $A$ is a $p$-random subset of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ with $p = 1/2$, then the independence number of $\Gamma_A$ is asymptotically equal to $\alpha(G(n, 1/2))$ with high probability. Our main theorem is the first extension of their result to $p = o(1)$: we show that, with high probability, $$\alpha(\Gamma_A) = (1 + o(1)) \alpha(G(n, p))$$ as long as $p \ge (\log n)^{-1/80}$.
  One of the tools in our proof is a geometric-flavoured theorem that generalizes Fre\u{i}man's lemma, the classical lower bound on the size of high dimensional sumsets. We also give a short proof of this result up to a constant factor; this version yields a much simpler proof of our main theorem at the expense of a worse constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.05163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To any $k$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb Q^n$ one can naturally associate a point in the Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}_{n,k}(\mathbb R)$ and two shapes of lattices of rank $k$ and $n-k$ respectively. These lattices originate by intersecting the $k$-dimensional subspace with the lattice $\mathbb Z^n$. Using unipotent dynamics we prove simultaneous equidistribution of all of these objects under a congruence conditions when $(k,n) \neq (2,4)$.</description>

      <title>Mixed quantifier prefixes over Diophantine equations with integer variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.08302v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we first review the history of Hilbert's Tenth Problem, and then study mixed quantifier prefixes over Diophantine equations with integer variables. For example, we prove that $\forall^2\exists^4$ over $\mathbb Z$ is undecidable, that is, there is no algorithm to determine for any $P(x_1,\ldots,x_6)\in\mathbb Z[x_1,\ldots,x_6]$ whether $$\forall x_1\forall x_2\exists x_3\exists x_4\exists x_5\exists x_6(P(x_1,\ldots,x_6)=0),$$ where $x_1,\ldots,x_6$ are integer variables. We also have some similar undecidable results with universal quantifies bounded, for example, $\exists^2\forall^2\exists^2$ over $\mathbb Z$ with $\forall$ bounded is undecidable. We conjecture that $\forall^2\exists^2$ over $\mathbb Z$ is undecidable.</description>

      <title>Bianchi modular symbols and $p$-adic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05592v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present paper, we constructed the $p$-adic $L$-function of Bianchi modular form. Also we proved that the first homology groups are generated by the special Bianchi modular symbols. As a corollary, the $\mu$-invariant of some isotopic component of the $p$-adic $L$-function vanishes for Bianchi newforms and a positive proportion of ordinary primes. Also we obtain the residual non-vanishing result of the integral $L$-values.</description>

      <title>The Manin-Peyre conjecture for smooth spherical Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.14841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Manin-Peyre conjecture is established for smooth spherical Fano threefolds of semisimple rank one and type N. Together with the previously solved case T and the toric cases, this covers all types of smooth spherical Fano threefolds. The case N features a number of structural novelties; most notably, one may lose regularity of the ambient toric variety, the height conditions may contain fractional exponents, and it may be necessary to exclude a thin subset with exceptionally many rational points from the count, as otherwise Manin's conjecture in its original form would turn out to be incorrect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to establish a complete Khintchine-Groshev type theorem in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous setting, on analytic nondegenerate manifolds over a local field of positive characteristic. The dual form of Diophantine approximation has been considered here. Our treatise provides the function field analogues of the various earlier results of this type, studied in the euclidean and S-adic framework, by Bernik, Kleinbock and Margulis, Beresnevich, Bernik, Kleinbock and Margulis, Badziahin, Beresnevich and Velani, Mohammadi and Golsefidy, and Datta and Ghosh.</description>

      <title>On the Constants of the Lang-Trotter Conjecture for CM Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09938v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Daqing Wan and Ping Xi studied the equivalence of the Lang-Trotter conjecture for CM elliptic curves and the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture for primes represented by a quadratic polynomial. Wan and Xi provided an alternative description of the Lang-Trotter conjecture under the Hardy-Littlewood conjecture. They obtained an explicit constant $\overline{\omega}_{E,r}$ in the asymptotics of the Lang-Trotter conjecture. They further conjectured that this particular constant would be equal to the constant $C_{E,r}$ in the asymptotics of the original Lang-Trotter conjecture. In this paper, we verify the same for $20$ CM elliptic curves, which also establishes the equivalence of the Lang-Trotter Conjecture and the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture with respect to $r$, for these CM elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence OEIS A281505 consists of distinct odd legs in right triangles with integer sides and prime hypotenuse. In this paper, we count the closely related quantity of even legs with almost prime hypotenuse. More precisely, we obtain the correct order of magnitude upper and lower bounds for the set of distinct even legs with 5-almost prime hypotenuse. This is a strong version of the appropriate analogy to a conjecture of Chow and Pomerance (stated there for prime hypotenuse).</description>

      <title>Gaps Between Consecutive Primes and the Exponential Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the primes less than $4 \times 10^{18}$, Oliveira e Silva et al. (2014) conjectured an asymptotic formula for the sum of the $k$th power of the gaps between consecutive primes less than a large number $x$. We show that the conjecture of Oliveira e Silva holds if and only if the $k$th moment of the first $n$ gaps is asymptotic to the $k$th moment of an exponential distribution with mean $\log n$, though the distribution of gaps is not exponential. Asymptotically exponential moments imply that the gaps asymptotically obey Taylor's law of fluctuation scaling: variance of the first $n$ gaps $\sim$ (mean of the first $n$ gaps)$^2$. If the distribution of the first $n$ gaps is asymptotically exponential with mean $\log n$, then the expectation of the largest of the first $n$ gaps is asymptotic to $(\log n)^2$. The largest of the first $n$ gaps is asymptotic to $(\log n)^2$ if and only if the Cram\'er-Shanks conjecture holds. Numerical counts of gaps and the maximal gap $G_n$ among the first $n$ gaps test these results. While most values of $G_n$ are better approximated by $(\log n)^2$ than by other models, seven values of $n$ with $G_{n} &gt;2 e^{-\gamma}(\log n)^2$ suggest that $\limsup_{n \to\infty} G_n/[2e^{-\gamma}(\log n)^2]$ may exceed 1.</description>

      <title>The shifted prime-divisor function over shifted primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\setminus\{0\}$. For every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we denote by $\omega_a^*(n)$ the number of shifted-prime divisors $p-a$ of $n$, where $p&gt;a$ is prime. In this paper, we study the moments of $\omega_a^*$ over shifted primes $p-b$. Specifically, we prove an asymptotic formula for the first moment and upper and lower bounds of the correct order of magnitude for the second moment. These results suggest that the average behavior of $\omega^*_a$ on shifted primes is similar to its average behavior on natural numbers. We shall also prove upper bounds for the mean values of sub-multiplicative functions in a nice class over the least common multiples of the shifted primes $p-a$ and $q-b$. Such upper bounds are intimately related to the second moments of $\omega^*_a$ over natural numbers and over shifted primes. Finally, we propose a new conjecture on the second moment of $\omega_1^*$ over natural numbers and provide a heuristic argument in support of this conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham found it conceivable that the best $n$-term Egyptian underapproximation of almost every positive number for sufficiently large $n$ gets constructed in a greedy manner, i.e., from the best $(n-1)$-term Egyptian underapproximation. We show that the opposite is true: the set of real numbers with this property has Lebesgue measure zero. [This note solves Problem 206 on Bloom's website "Erd\H{o}s problems".]</description>

      <title>A derivation of Dickson polynomials using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, the first-order Dickson polynomials are introduced through a particular case of the expression of the trace of the $n^{th}$ power of a matrix in terms of powers of the trace and determinant of the matrix itself. The technique relies on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and its application to the derivation of formulas due to Carlitz and to second-order Dickson polynomials is straightforward. Finally, generalization of Dickson polynomials over finite fields and multivariate Dickson polynomials are evoked as potential avenues of investigation in the same framework.</description>

      <title>A local twisted trace formula for Whittaker induction of coregular symmetric pairs: the geometric side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the geometric expansion of a local twisted trace formula for the Whittaker induction of any symmetric pairs that are coregular. This generalizes the local (twisted) trace formula for reductive groups proved by Arthur \cite{A91} and Waldspurger \cite{WalFTLtordue}. We also prove a formula for the regular germs of quasi-characters associated to strongly cuspidal functions in terms of certain weighted orbital integrals. As a consequence of our trace formula and the formula for regular germs of quasi-characters, we prove a simple local trace formula of those models for strongly cuspidal test functions which implies a multiplicity formula for these models. We also present various applications of our trace formula and multiplicity formula, including a necessary condition for a discrete L-packet to contain a representation with a unitary Shalika model (resp. a Galois model for classical groups) in terms of the associated Langlands parameter, and we also compute the summation of the corresponding multiplicities for certain discrete L-packets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</description>
