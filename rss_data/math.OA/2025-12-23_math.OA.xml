      <title>Sampling elements of a finite group: efficiency of the product replacement algorithm with an accumulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group generated by $k$ elements. The well-known product replacement algorithm provides an effective method for sampling generating sets of $G$. We study a refinement of this algorithm that is designed to output individual elements of $G$. We show that after $O(k^2\log|G|)$ steps, the distribution of the output is close to uniform on $G$, which improves upon the best results known to date. The proof proceeds via spectral gap estimates and uses computer assisted calculations.</description>

      <title>Limits in categories of \'etale groupoids and pseudogroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the category of sober \'etale groupoids and actors admits all small limits. This is achieved by computing the limits in the equivalent category of pseudogroups with pseudogroup morphisms, which we show admits a forgetful functor to the category of sets which creates limits. We give an alternative proof of the adjunction of Cockett and Garner in the specific setting of \'etale groupoids and pseudogroups which is a central tool for computing limits of sober \'etale groupoids.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Kadison--Schwarz maps on $M_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kadison--Schwarz (KS) maps form a natural class of positive linear maps lying between positivity and complete positivity. Despite their relevance in quantum dynamics and operator algebras, a detailed characterization of KS maps beyond low dimensions remains largely open. In this work we analyze unital linear maps on $M_3$ using the Bloch--Gell--Mann representation. Exploiting unitary equivalence and structural properties of the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ algebra, we derive analytic conditions ensuring the Kadison--Schwarz property. Our approach clarifies the relation between KS maps and completely positive maps on $M_3$.</description>

      <title>Even Hypergeometric Polynomials and Finite Free Commutators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the class of even polynomials and their behavior with respect to finite free convolutions. To this end, we use some specific hypergeometric polynomials and a variation of the rectangular finite free convolution to understand even real-rooted polynomials in terms of positive-rooted polynomials. Then, we study some classes of even polynomials that are of interest in finite free probability, such as even hypergeometric polynomials, symmetrizations, and finite free commutators. Specifically, we provide many new examples of these objects, involving classical families of special polynomials (such as Laguerre, Hermite, and Jacobi). Finally, we relate the limiting root distributions of sequences of even polynomials with the corresponding symmetric measures that arise in free probability.</description>

      <title>Additivity, Haag duality, and non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in von Neumann Algebraic Quantum Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom, states can be infinitely entangled across a pair of subsystems, but are there different forms of infinite entanglement? To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a framework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full system's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50 years, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by deriving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational axioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem relate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong connection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III, and their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of operational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of type III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error when "embezzling" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type classification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite quantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support.</description>

      <title>Embedding $K$-algebras into Leavitt algebra $L_K(1, 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the commutative monoid $T = (\{0, 1\}, \vee)$ is a weak terminal object in the category of conical monoids with order units, there is a unital homomorphism from every Bergman $K$-algebra corresponding to a conical finitely generated commutative monoid into the Leavitt algebra $L_K(1,2)$, where $K$ is a field. This fact will be used to give a short proof that Leavitt path algebras associated with finite graphs with condition $(L)$ embed into $L_K(1,2)$, as well as provide criteria for an embedding of $M_s(L_{K}(1, m))$ in $M_s(L_{K}(1, n))$. As our second main result, we show that the Heisenberg equation $xy-yx=1$ cannot be realized in any Steinberg algebra, implying that the first Weyl algebra cannot be embedded into $L_K(1,2)$, giving an affirmative answer to a question of Brownlowe and Sorensen on the embeddability of $K$-algebras with a countable basis inside $L_K(1,2)$. Whereas, $L_K(E)$ cannot be graded-embedded into $L_K(1,2)$ in general, in the final section we show that $L_K(E)$ does admit a graded embedding into $L_K(1,2)\otimes_K L_K(1,2)$.</description>
