      <title>Global transformer overheating from geomagnetic storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geomagnetic storms occurring due to sustained, high-speed solar winds are known to induce currents in power distribution networks. These geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) can cause high voltage transformers (HVT) to overheat, thus resulting in a catastrophic electricity loss event (CELE). Since significant portions of infrastructures around the world rely heavily on access to electric power, it is essential to estimate the risks associated with GICs on a global scale. We assemble multiple methodologies across various scientific disciplines to develop a framework assessing the probability of a severe geomagnetic storm causing a long-term, widespread power outage. Our model incorporates thermal models of HVT tie bar hot spots, historical geoelectric field estimates, and a global conductivity model to estimate the risk of long-term power outage for regions between -70 degrees and 80 degrees geomagnetic latitude due to transformer overheating failure. Assuming a uniform 33% HVT spare capacity, our analysis indicates that a 1 in 10,000 year storm would result in approximately 1% of the population in Europe and North America experiencing a long-term (months to years) electricity loss.</description>

      <title>A Sociotechnical Readiness Level Framework for the Development of Advanced Nuclear Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale was initially developed by NASA in the 1970s and is now widely used in space, nuclear, and other complex technology sectors in the US and beyond. The TRL scale is particularly useful for determining where extrapolation of untested sub-systems or features could produce technical risk, cause expensive redesigns, or act as a roadblock to technology development. In this paper, we propose the development of a sociotechnical readiness level (SRL), premised on the understanding that the successful development and eventual use of a technology requires achieving not only full technological readiness but also anticipating, prioritizing, and addressing societal concerns that may arise during the course of development of a technology. Failures to anticipate and address societal factors in the early stages of technology development have led to high-profile delays and, in some cases, ultimate failures of nuclear technology projects. The sociotechnical readiness scale, which conceptually draws on the design research and science and technology studies scholarship, centers on principles of equity and environmental justice in technology design, and emphasizes the need for social engagement during the process of technology development. Nowhere is such an approach to technology development more vital or needed than for the long-term management of spent nuclear fuel.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the stochastic SIR model on random bond-diluted lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of bond-dilution disorder on the critical behavior of the stochastic SIR model. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted using square lattices with first- and second-nearest neighbor interactions. Quenched bond-diluted lattice disorder was introduced into the systems, allowing them to evolve over time. By employing percolation theory and finite-size scaling analysis, we estimate both the critical threshold and leading critical exponent ratios of the model for different bond-dilution rates ($p$). An examination of the average size of the percolating cluster and the size distribution of non-percolating clusters of recovered individuals was performed to ascertain the universality class of the model. The simulation results strongly indicate that the present model belongs to a new universality class distinct from that of 2D dynamical percolation, depending on the specific $p$ value under consideration.</description>

      <title>A Universe of Sound: Processing NASA Data into Sonifications to Explore Participant Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, astronomy has prioritized visuals to present information, with scientists and communicators overlooking the critical need to communicate astrophysics with blind or low-vision audiences and provide novel channels for sighted audiences to process scientific information. This study sonified NASA data of three astronomical objects presented as aural visualizations, then surveyed blind or low-vision and sighted individuals to elicit feedback on the experience of these pieces as it relates to enjoyment, education, and trust of the scientific data. Data analyses from 3,184 sighted or blind or low-vision survey participants yielded significant self-reported learning gains and positive experiential responses. Results showed that astrophysical data engaging multiple senses could establish additional avenues of trust, increase access, and promote awareness of accessibility in sighted and blind or low-vision communities.</description>

      <title>A Study of Three Influencer Archetypes for the Control of Opinion Spread in Time-Varying Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the impact of information spread in time-varying social networks, where agents request to follow other agents with aligned opinions while dropping ties to neighbors whose posts are too dissimilar to their own views. Opinion control and rhetorical influence has a very long history, employing various methods including education, persuasion, propaganda, marketing, and manipulation through mis-, dis-, and mal-information. The automation of opinion controllers, however, has only recently become easily deployable at a wide scale, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI that can translate the quantified commands from opinion controllers into actual content with the appropriate nuance. Automated agents in social networks can be deployed for various purposes, such as breaking up echo chambers, bridging valuable new connections between agents, or shaping the opinions of a target population -- and all of these raise important ethical concerns that deserve serious attention and thoughtful discussion and debate. This paper attempts to contribute to this discussion by considering three archetypal influencing styles observed by human drivers in these settings, comparing and contrasting the impact of these different control methods on the opinions of agents in the network. We will demonstrate the efficacy of current generative AI for generating nuanced content consistent with the command signal from automatic opinion controllers like these, and we will report on frameworks for approaching the relevant ethical considerations.</description>

      <title>The process of polarisation as a loss of dimensionality: measuring changes in polarisation using Singular Value Decomposition of network graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing polarisation in our societies is a major international concern. Current approaches to defining and detecting polarisation largely rely on finding evidence of bimodality in social networks or voter opinion surveys. It is difficult to detect temporal trends in polarisation, as the results usually fall into a binary of polarised or non-polarised, which cannot robustly show that subsequent increases in bimodality are statistically significant.
  Our work is aligned with Baldassari and Gelman's theory that polarisation should be defined as increasing correlation between positions in the ideological field. We also draw from post-structuralist work which argues that polarisation is the process of both the ideological and material layers of society being segregated into two poles, as in cases of apartheid. Thus, in order to measure the polarisation in a society, it would be beneficial to be able to assess social networks directly.
  In this paper we use Random Dot Product Graphs to embed social networks in metric spaces. In the case of a social network, the embedded dimensionality corresponds to the number of reasons any two people may form a social connection. A decrease in the optimal dimensionality for the embedding of the network graph, as measured using truncated Singular Value Decomposition of the graph adjacency matrix, indicates increasing polarisation in the network.
  We apply this method to two different Twitter networks based on discussions of climate change, and show that our methods agree with other researchers' detection of polarisation in this space. We also use networks generated by stochastic block models to explore how an increase of the isolation between distinct communities in a network, or the increase in the predominance of one community over the other, are identifiable as polarisation processes.</description>

      <title>Exploring language relations through syntactic distances and geographic proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Languages are grouped into families that share common linguistic traits. While this approach has been successful in understanding genetic relations between diverse languages, more analyses are needed to accurately quantify their relatedness, especially in less studied linguistic levels such as syntax. Here, we explore linguistic distances using series of parts of speech (POS) extracted from the Universal Dependencies dataset. Within an information-theoretic framework, we show that employing POS trigrams maximizes the possibility of capturing syntactic variations while being at the same time compatible with the amount of available data. Linguistic connections are then established by assessing pairwise distances based on the POS distributions. Intriguingly, our analysis reveals definite clusters that correspond to well known language families and groups, with exceptions explained by distinct morphological typologies. Furthermore, we obtain a significant correlation between language similarity and geographic distance, which underscores the influence of spatial proximity on language kinships.</description>

      <title>Energy Inequality in Climate Hazards: Empirical Evidence of Social and Spatial Disparities in Managed and Hazard-Induced Power Outages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy sector in the United States is ever more vulnerable to extreme climatic hazards, leading to multiple hazard-induced and managed power outages. Utility companies reportedly prioritize the restoration of power systems based on the number of outages and the size of affected populations. This approach fails to account for unequal impacts. Research in equitable infrastructure emphasizes that certain populations, such as lower income and racial-ethnic minority households, are disproportionately impacted by disruptions in the power system. Moreover, connected network qualities of the power system suggests an element of spatial vulnerabilities. However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the presence and extent of energy inequality. A main roadblock is the data collection process, in that outage data is often perishable and not found at granular spatial scales to allow the undertaking of a comprehensive analysis. Recognizing this important gap, this study collected and analyzed observational data related to Winter Storm Uri (2021) and Hurricane Ida (2021). In the managed outages of Winter Storm Uri, census tracts with lower income and more Hispanic households had a higher median duration of outages. In the hazard-induced outages of Hurricane Ida, zip codes with lower income and more black households had a higher median duration of power outages. Both the managed and hazard-induced outages had moderate levels of spatial inequality as shown through the spatial Gini and infrastructure index analyses. The findings provide evidence of pervasive social and spatial inequality in power outages during climate hazards and highlight the importance of integrating equity into the manner in which utility managers and emergency planners restore power outages.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of cognition and cooperation in structured populations under reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the evolution of behavior under reinforcement learning in a Prisoner's Dilemma where agents interact in a regular network and can learn about whether they play one-shot or repeatedly by incurring a cost of deliberation. With respect to other behavioral rules used in the literature, (i) we confirm the existence of a threshold value of the probability of repeated interaction, switching the emergent behavior from intuitive defector to dual-process cooperator; (ii) we find a different role of the node degree, with smaller degrees reducing the evolutionary success of dual-process cooperators; (iii) we observe a higher frequency of deliberation.</description>
