      <title>Search Capability for Near-Earth Objects with the Wide Field Survey Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), with a powerful sky survey capability in the northern hemisphere, will play an important role in asteroid searching and monitoring. However, WFST is not a telescope dedicated to near-Earth asteroids (NEOs) searching. In order to improve the efficiency of finding NEOs on the premise of meeting the needs of other scientific research, we ran mock observations for WFST to study its search capability for NEOs. The NEO population model, the WFST detection model and site conditions are taken into account in our simulations. Based on the original scheduling scheme, we present two new schemes. Compared to the original scheme, the optimized scheme can improve the search capability of known and unknown NEOs by 100% and 50%. We also emphasized the importance of trailing loss and proposed an improved effective field of view model. In addition, it is predicted that adopting the clear-day ratio of 0.7 and the optimized scheme, for NEOs with absolute magnitude from 17 to 25, WFST can provide tracklets for about 1800 NEOs if their orbits are known, and in the case of blind search, more than 600 NEOs can be found by WFST. The new schemes provide valuable reference and suggestions for the WFST's regular survey strategy.</description>

      <title>Resonance Capture and Stability Analysis for Planet Pairs under Type I Disk Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model to investigate a two-planet pair that undergoes convergent type I migration in a gaseous protoplanetary disk and traps into the first-order mean motion resonance. Our study identifies the conditions for resonant capture and explores the subsequent dynamical stability of the system. We derive the analytical criteria for planets with an arbitrary mass ratio and validate through numerical N-body simulations. Slow migration and weak eccentricity damping are required for resonant capture, the latter of which has not received enough attention in the literature. Once capture into resonance, their following stability can be classified into three regimes: stable trap, overstable trap and escape. Notably, resonant capture remains stable when the inner planet significantly outweighs the outer one. However, the subsequent evolution can be diverse when the mass of the inner planet is lower or comparable to that of the outer planet. Stability weakens as the relative strength between migration and eccentricity damping increases. The key results can be comprehensively demonstrated in a $\tau_{a}$-$\tau_{a}/\tau_{\rm e}$ plot, where $\tau_{a}$ and $\tau_{\rm e}$ are orbital decay and eccentricity damping timescales, respectively.</description>

      <title>FindPOTATOs: Minor Planet Observation Linking Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For minor planet observations to be archived and used by the scientific community, observations of individual objects must be linked together into groups called tracklets. This linking is nontrivial, as linking software must find real tracklets in noisy data within a reasonable amount of time. We describe FindPOTATOs, a linking software written in Python that can assemble minor planet tracklets. With the appropriate parameters, FindPOTATOs assembles tracklets for a variety of objects, including close-approaching near-Earth objects and trans-Neptunian objects. FindPOTATOs is ideal for processing data sets taken at small observatories, processing archival data, or finding tracklets of minor planets on unusual orbits. This paper describes the code structure, usage, and validation.</description>

      <title>Dust production through collisions between small bodies: an application to the G-ring arc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The G-ring arc of Saturn, confined by the 7:6 corotation eccentric resonance with Mimas, is primarily composed of micrometric particles. These particles, significantly influenced by the solar radiation pressure, are subject to rapid depletion. This study investigates a mechanism for dust replenishment in the arc, specifically analyzing collisions between macroscopic bodies and the satellite Aegaeon. Utilizing N-body and Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, we assess the dust generation from these impacts, with a focus on the most likely collision parameters derived from the N-body simulations. Our findings indicate that, while collisions among macroscopic bodies are inefficient for dust production, impacts involving Aegaeon are substantially more effective, providing conservative lower limits for dust generation. This mechanism, in conjunction with the natural decay processes and continuous dust generation from impacts, potentially keeps the arc population over thousands of years with a possible variation in brightness.</description>

      <title>A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</description>

      <title>ExoSim 2: the new Exoplanet Observation Simulator applied to the Ariel space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ExoSim 2 is the next generation of the Exoplanet Observation Simulator (ExoSim) tailored for spectro-photometric observations of transiting exoplanets from space, ground, and sub-orbital platforms. This software is a complete rewrite implemented in Python 3, embracing object-oriented design principles, which allow users to replace each component with their functions when required. ExoSim 2 is publicly available on GitHub, serving as a valuable resource for the scientific community. ExoSim 2 employs a modular architecture using Task classes, encapsulating simulation algorithms and functions. This flexible design facilitates the extensibility and adaptability of ExoSim 2 to diverse instrument configurations to address the evolving needs of the scientific community. Data management within ExoSim 2 is handled by the Signal class, which represents a structured data cube incorporating time, space, and spectral dimensions. The code execution in ExoSim 2 follows a three-step workflow: the creation of focal planes, the production of Sub-Exposure blocks, and the generation of non-destructive reads (NDRs). Each step can be executed independently, optimizing time and computational resources. ExoSim 2 has been extensively validated against other tools like ArielRad and has demonstrated consistency in estimating photon conversion efficiency, saturation time, and signal generation. The simulator has also been validated independently for instantaneous read-out and jitter simulation, and for astronomical signal representation. In conclusion, ExoSim 2 offers a robust and flexible tool for exoplanet observation simulation, capable of adapting to diverse instrument configurations and evolving scientific needs. Its design principles and validation results underscore its potential as a valuable resource in the field of exoplanet research.</description>

      <title>Cosmic ray-driven bioenergetics for Life in Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to models such as panspermia or the Nebula-Relay hypothesis, the ancestors of life on Earth once lived in molecular clouds. Then what are the energy source and bioenergetics for such lifeforms? In this paper, we propose a new bioenergetic mechanism powered by cosmic ray ionization of hydrogen molecules and we argue that it may relate to or be the origin of chemiosmosis. Based on this mechanism, we suggest that the Last Universal Common Ancestor is a type of lifeform that utilize hydrogen molecules as donors of electron transport chains.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Galactic population of free-floating planets from realistic initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first prediction for the mass distribution function of Galactic free-floating planets (FFPs) that aims to accurately include the relative contributions of multiple formation pathways and stellar populations. We derive our predicted distribution from dedicated simulations of planet birth, growth, migration, and ejection around circumbinary systems and extend these results to also include the contributions from single and wide binary systems. Our resulting FFP mass distribution shows several distinct features, including a strong peak at $\sim 8 M_{\oplus}$ arising from the transition between pebble and gas accretion regimes and a trough at $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ due to the shift in the dominant ejection process from planet-planet scattering to ejection through interactions with stars in circumbinary systems. We find that interactions with the central binary in close circumbinary systems are likely the dominant progenitor for FFPs more massive than Earth, leading to a steep power-law dependence in mass that agrees well with existing observations. In contrast, we find planet-planet scattering events in single and wide binary systems likely produce the majority of planets at Mars mass and below, resulting in a shallower power-law dependence. Our results suggest that existing extrapolations into the sub-terrestrial mass range may significantly overestimate the true FFP abundance. The features we predict in the mass distribution of FFPs will be detectable by upcoming space-based microlensing surveys and, if observed, will provide key insight into the origins of FFPs and the environments in which they form.</description>
