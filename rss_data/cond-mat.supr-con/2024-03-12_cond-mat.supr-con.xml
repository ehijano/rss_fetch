      <title>Topological superconductivity with mixed singlet-triplet pairing in moir\'e transition-metal-dichalcogenide bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strong coupling topological superconductivity in twisted moir\'e bilayer WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on an effective $t$-$J$ model with displacement-field-dependent complex hoppings, which is treated with the variational Gutzwiller projection method. The calculated phase diagram contains domes of topologically nontrivial superconducting phases, with Chern numbers $C=\pm 2,\;\pm 4$. The order parameter is characterized by a mixed $d$+$id$-wave (singlet) and $p$-$ip$-wave (triplet) gap symmetry. We also report on the appearance of an additional topologically trivial extended $s$-wave and $f$-wave paired phase. As we show, by changing the electron density and displacement field, one can tune the singlet and triplet contributions to the pairing, as well as induce topological phase transitions between superconducting states characterized by different values of the Chern number. We analyze the physical origin of the reported effects and discuss it briefly in the view of new possibilities for designing unconventional superconductivity in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Finite-size effects in hyperuniform vortex matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel hyperuniform materials are emerging as an active field of applied and basic research since they can be designed to have exceptional physical properties. This ubiquitous state of matter presents a hidden order that is characterized by the density of constituents of the system being uniform at large scales, as in a perfect crystal, although they can be isotropic and disordered like a liquid. In the quest for synthesizing hyperuniform materials in experimental conditions, the impact of finite-size effects remains as an open question to be addressed. We use vortex matter in type-II superconductors as a toy model system to study this issue. We previously reported that vortex matter nucleated in samples with point disorder is effectively hyperuniform and thus presents the interesting physical properties inherent to hyperuniform systems. In this work we present experimental evidence that on decreasing the thickness of the vortex system its hyperuniform order is depleted. By means of hydrodynamic arguments we show that the experimentally observed depletion can be associated to two crossovers that we describe within a hydrodynamic approximation. The first crossover length is thickness-dependent and separates a class-II hyperuniform regime at intermediate lengthscales from a regime that can become asymptotically non-hyperuniform for large wavelengths in very thin samples. The second crossover takes place at smaller lengthscales and marks the onset of a faster increase of density fluctuations due to the dispersivity of the elastic constants. Our work points to a novel mechanism of emerging hyperuniformity controlled by the thickness of the host sample, an issue that has to be taken into account when growing hyperuniform structures for technological applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity of nonunitary triplet superconductors: application to UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is considerable evidence that the heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ is a spin-triplet superconductor, possibly manifesting time-reversal symmetry breaking, as measured by Kerr effect and muon spin resonance experiments below the critical temperature, in some samples. Such signals can arise due to a chiral orbital state, or possible nonunitary pairing. Although experiments at low $T$ appear to be consistent with point nodes in the spectral gap, the detailed form of the order parameter and even the nodal positions are not yet determined. Thermal conductivity measurements can extend to quite low temperatures, with varying heat current direction can therefore provide information on the order parameter structure. Here we derive a general expression for the thermal conductivity of a spin triplet superconductor, and use it to compare the low-temperature behavior of various states proposed for UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Conventional Superconductivity in the Doped Kagome Superconductor Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5 from Vortex Lattice Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hallmark of unconventional superconductors is their complex electronic phase diagrams where "intertwined orders" of charge-spin-lattice degrees of freedom compete and coexist as in copper oxides and iron pnictides. While the electronic phase diagram of kagome lattice superconductor such as CsV3Sb5 also exhibits complex behavior involving coexisting and competing charge density wave order and superconductivity, much is unclear about the microscopic origin of superconductivity. Here, we study the vortex lattice (VL) in superconducting state of Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5, where the Ta-doping suppresses charge order and enhances superconductivity. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we show that the VL exhibits a strikingly conventional behavior. This includes a triangular VL with a period consistent with 2e-pairing, a field dependent scattering intensity that follows a London model, and a temperature dependence consistent with a uniform superconducting gap expected for s-wave pairing. These results suggest that optimal bulk superconductivity in Cs(V1-xTax)3Sb5 arises from a conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer electron-lattice coupling, different from spin fluctuation mediated unconventional copper and iron based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in the Fibonacci Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity was recently reported in several quasicrystalline systems. These are materials which are structurally ordered, but since they are not translationally invariant, the usual BCS theory does not apply. At the present time, the underlying mechanism and the properties of the superconducting phase are insufficiently understood. To gain a better understanding of quasiperiodic superconductors, we consider the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci chain, and examine its low-temperature superconducting phase in detail using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field approach. We obtain superconducting solutions as a function of the parameters controlling the physical properties of the system: the strength of the Hubbard attraction $U$, the chemical potential $\mu$, and the strength of the modulation of the Fibonacci Hamiltonian, $w$. We find that there is a bulk transition at a critical temperature that obeys a power law in $U$, where all sites become superconducting at once. All sites with the Fibonacci chain have the same superconducting gap width. The local superconducting order parameter is self-similar both in real and perpendicular space. The interplay between the Hubbard attraction and the intrinsic gaps of the Fibonacci chain results in a complex zero-temperature $\mu$-$U$ phase diagram with insulating domes surrounded by superconducting regions. Finally, we show that tuning $w$ from weak to strong quasicrystalline modulation gives rise to qualitatively different thermodynamic behaviors as could be observed by measuring the specific heat.</description>

      <title>Observation of in-gap states in a two-dimensional CrI2/NbSe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional magnetic structures coupled with a superconductor are promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes, which are considered as novel non-Abelian anyons with potential applications in topological quantum computing. Here, we report the observation of in-gap edge states and zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBCPs) in a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic-superconducting heterostructure consisting of a single-layer chromium diiodide (CrI2) on a niobium diselenide (NbSe2) superconductor. Single-layer CrI2 nanosheets, which hold antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states according to our first-principles calculations, were epitaxially grown on the layered NbSe2 substrate. By using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observed robust in-gap states spatially located at the edge of the nanosheets and defect-induced ZBCPs inside the CrI2 nanosheets. Magnetic-flux vortices induced by an external field exhibit broken threefold rotational symmetry of the pristine NbSe2 superconductor, implying the efficient modulation of the interfacial superconducting states by the epitaxial CrI2 layer. A phenomenological model was proposed and suggested the existence of chiral edge states in a 2D AFM-superconducting hybrid system with an even Chern number, providing a qualitatively plausible understanding for our experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Optimal parametric control of transport across a Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optimal control strategies for the DC transport across a Josephson junction. Specifically, we consider a junction in which the Josephson coupling is driven parametrically, with either a bichromatic or a trichromatic driving protocol, and optimize the prefactor of the 1/$\omega$ divergence of the imaginary part of the conductivity. We demonstrate that for an optimal bichromatic protocol an enhancement of 70 can be reached, and for an optimal trichromatic protocol an enhancement of 135. This is motivated by pump-probe experiments that have demonstrated light-enhanced superconductivity along the c-axis of underdoped YBCO, where the junction serves as a minimal model for the c-axis coupling of superconducting layers. Therefore, the significant enhancement of superconductivity that we show for multi-frequency protocols demonstrates that the advancement of pump-probe technology towards these strategies is highly desirable.</description>

      <title>Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in the s-wave superconducting kagome Hubbard model: Self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states in kagome superconductors have been studied recently in theory and experiments. However, more details of local superconductivity around the YSR states in kagome superconductors and the existence of the related first-order phase transition remain unclear. Based on the self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the $s-$wave superconducting kagome Hubbard model, we show that first-order phase transitions occur when varying the spin-magnetic interaction $J$ of the magnetic impurity, and discontinuities of hysteresis loops in the plots of the local pair potential versus $J$ happen at the upper and lower critical interactions $J_{\rm c1}$ and $J_{\rm c2}$, rather than the conventional critical interaction $J_c$. The minimal energy of the stable YSR state $E_{\rm YSR, min}$ is non-zero for the chemical potential at the van Hove singularities, Dirac point, and the flat band. Furthermore, $J_{\rm c1}$, $J_{\rm c2}$, and $E_{\rm YSR, min}$ are dependent on the chemical potential and the superconducting coupling interaction.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Surface Superconductivity through Interference in Superconducting-proximity Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting-proximity topological insulators (STIs) have garnered significant research attention over the past two decades. In this Letter, we demonstrate that a low-dimensional STI in the topological-nontrivial phase (TP) exhibits an interference-induced surface (boundary) superconductivity with the surface critical temperature $T_{cs}$ significantly higher than the bulk one $T_{cb}$. Such a surface superconductivity is built due to the interference of the scattering quasiparticle states, rather than due to the presence of the topological bound states (TBSs). As the system goes deeper into the TP, the surface exhibits a crossover from the interference- to TBS-induced phase, where the surface enhancement of superconductivity is governed by the TBSs. Our study unveils a substantial variation in the maximal $T_{cs}$ along this crossover, attaining values being twice the maximal bulk critical temperature of the STI. Beyond shedding light on the nature of surface superconductivity in STIs, our study introduces a tangible method for experimentally manipulating their critical superconducting temperatures.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superfluidity from a particle-number-conserving perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate odd-in-time (or odd-frequency) pairing of fermions in equilibrium systems within the particle-number-conserving framework of Penrose, Onsager and Yang, where superfluid order is defined by macrosocopic eigenvalues of reduced density matrices. We show that odd-frequency pair correlations are synonymous with even fermion-exchange symmetry in a time-dependent correlation function that generalises the two-body reduced density matrix. Macroscopic even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density matrices through the symmetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify and characterise a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the spin-imbalanced Fermi superfluid as an example. The generator scenario is demonstrated by the composite-boson condensate arising for itinerant electrons coupled to magnetic excitations. Structural analysis of the transformer and generator matrices is shown to provide general conditions for odd-frequency pairing order to arise in a given system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, the three stable MXenes M n+1 C n O 2 (M=Nb,Ta) are explored based onfirst-principles calculations. These materials are important derivatives of 2D materials and exhib-it distinctive properties, holding vast potential in nanodevices. All these M n+1 C n O 2 (M=Nb,Ta)materials exhibit outstanding superconducting performance, with corresponding superconductingtransition temperatures of 23.00K, 25.00K, and 29.00K. Analysis reveals that the high supercon-ducting transition temperatures of MXenes M n+1 C n O 2 (M=Nb,Ta) are closely associated with thehigh value of the logarithmic average of phonon frequencies, {\omega} log , and the strong electron-phononcoupling (EPC), attributed to the crucial contribution of low-frequency phonons. Additionally, weapplied strain treatments of 2% and 4% to M n+1 C n O 2 (M=Nb,Ta), resulting in varying changes insuperconducting transition temperatures under different strains.</description>

      <title>Magnetic signatures of multicomponent superconductivity in pressurized UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy fermion material UTe$_2$ possesses a rich phase diagram with multiple superconducting phases, several of which exhibit characteristics of odd-parity pairing. Here, we report on the pressure dependence of signatures of the superconducting transition in the temperature dependent ac magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T)$ in high quality UTe$_2$ single crystals. We resolve a single superconducting transition in $\chi(T)$ at low pressures $&lt;$ 0.3 GPa. At higher pressure, however, a second feature emerges in $\chi(T)$, which is located at the thermodynamic phase boundary between two separate superconducting states previously identified by specific heat studies. The observation of a two-step transition in $\chi(T)$ can be understood as a consequence of the change in the London penetration depth, when UTe$_2$ switches from one superconducting phase into another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) cavity plays an essential role in various areas like superconducting qubits, parametric amplifiers, radiation detectors, and studying magnon-photon and photon-phonon coupling. Despite its wide-ranging applications, the use of SCPW cavities to study various van der Waals 2D materials is relatively unexplored. The resonant modes of the SCPW cavity exquisitely sense the dielectric environment. In this work, we measure the charge compressibility of bilayer graphene coupled to a half-wavelength SCPW cavity. Our approach provides a means to detect subtle changes in the capacitance of the bilayer graphene heterostructure, which depends on the compressibility of bilayer graphene, manifesting as shifts in the resonant frequency of the cavity. This method holds promise for exploring a wide class of van der Waals 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and their moir\'e where DC transport measurement is challenging.</description>

      <title>What do we learn from impurities and disorder in High Tc cuprates?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We established that the morphology of the phase diagrams is mostly governed by disorder in the various cuprate families. In the minimally disordered YBCO substitutions of Zn or Li spinless impurities on the planar Cu sites control the extent of the spin glass phase and superconducting (SC) dome. NMR data establish that these defects induce in their vicinity a cloud with a Kondo like paramagnetic behavior that differs markedly between the pseudogap and strange metal regimes. We have studied the evolution of transport properties with disorder by introduction of a controlled content of in plane vacancies by electron irradiation. At high T the inelastic scattering of the carriers is surprisingly disorder independent, and governed by the excitations of the correlated electronic state. The low T upturns of the resistivity, that are associated with single impurity Kondo like scattering, agree qualitatively with the local magnetism induced by spinless impurities. Very large defect contents are required to induce Metal Insulator Crossovers. In the SC state, the defect induced reduction of Tc scales quasi linearly with residual resistivity. The paraconductivity due to SC fluctuations, deduced from high field magnetoresistance measurements vanishes beyond a temperature T//c and a field H//c that decrease with increasing defect content. In the pseudogap regime the weaker decrease of T//c with respect to that of Tc reveals a loss of SC phase coherence in presence of disorder. This initiates a discussion of its interplay with pair breaking and allows us to confirm that the family specific dopant induced disorder or order controls the phase diagram. In the ideal disorder free cuprate the 2D SC state would certainly persist at low doping. This ensemble of data provides serious challenges for the theoretical understanding of superconductivity and the normal state in these SC correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>van Hove Singularity-Driven Emergence of Multiple Flat Bands in Kagome Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The newly discovered Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K, Rb and Cs) continue to bring surprises in generating unusual phenomena and physical properties, including anomalous Hall effect, unconventional charge density wave, electronic nematicity and time-reversal symmetry breaking. Here we report an unexpected emergence of multiple flat bands in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors. By performing high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) measurements, we observed four branches of flat bands that span over the entire momentum space. The appearance of the flat bands is not anticipated from the band structure calculations and cannot be accounted for by the known mechanisms of flat band generation. It is intimately related to the evolution of van Hove singularities. It is for the first time to observe such emergence of multiple flat bands in solid materials. Our findings provide new insights in revealing the underlying mechanism that governs the unusual behaviors in the Kagome superconductors. They also provide a new pathway in producing flat bands and set a platform to study the flat bands related physics.</description>

      <title>$^{27}$Al NMR study of the magnetic Weyl semimetal CeAlGe</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent observations of electronic correlation effect [M. Corasaniti \textit{et al}., Phys. Rev. B \textbf{104}, L121112 (2021)] and topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations [N. Drucker \textit{et al}., Nat. Commun. \textbf{14}, 5182 (2023)] in the noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate CeAlGe, we performed systematic studies on the local static and dynamic spin susceptibilities by $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance. Due to the large spin susceptibility from Ce-$4f$ electrons, the theoretically predicted responses from Weyl fermions are overwhelmed. A Knight-shift anomaly is observed below $T^*\sim50$ K, a signature of the onset of coherent Kondo coupling. In addition, an anomalous peak is found in $1/T_1T$ near 15 K, well above the magnetic ordering temperature $T_N \approx 5$ K, which probably is a consequence of topology-stabilized magnetic fluctuations. These results highlight the interplay among electronic correlation, magnetism and band topology in this family of Kondo Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Topological solitons stabilized by a background gauge field and soliton-anti-soliton asymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topological lumps supported by the second homotopy group $\pi_2(S^2) \simeq {\mathbb Z}$ in a gauged $O(3)$ model without any potential term coupled with a (non)dynamical $U(1)$ gauge field. It is known that gauged-lumps are stable with an easy-plane potential term but are unstable to expand if the model has no potential term. In this paper, we find that these gauged lumps without a potential term can be made stable by putting them in a uniform magnetic field, irrespective of whether the gauge field is dynamical or not. In the case of the non-dynamical gauge field, only either of lumps or anti-lumps stably exists depending on the sign of the background magnetic field, and the other is unstable to shrink to be singular. We also construct coaxial multiple lumps whose size and mass exhibit a behaviour of droplets. In the case of the dynamical gauge field, both the lumps and anti-lumps stably exist with different masses; the lighter (heavier) one corresponds to the (un)stable one in the case of the nondynamical gauge field. We find that a lump behaves as a superconducting ring and traps magnetic field in its inside, with the total magnetic field reduced from the background magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Superconductor-altermagnet memory functionality without stray fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel class of antiferromagnets, dubbed altermagnets, exhibit a non-relativistically spin-split band structure reminiscent of $d$-wave superconductors, despite the absence of net magnetization. This unique characteristic enables utilization in cryogenic stray-field-free memory devices, offering the possibility of achieving high storage densities. In this Letter, we determine how a proximate altermagnet influences the critical temperature $T_c$ of a conventional $s$-wave singlet superconductor. Considering both a bilayer and trilayer, we show that such hybrid structures may serve as stray-field free memory devices where the critical temperature is controlled by rotating the N\'eel vector of one altermagnet, providing infinite magnetoresistance. Furthermore, our study reveals that altermagnetism can coexist with superconductivity up to a critical strength of the altermagnetic order as well as robustness of the altermagnetic influence on the conduction electrons against non-magnetic impurities, ensuring the persistence of the proximity effect under realistic experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of nematic superconductivity and spin density wave in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that doped twisted bilayer graphene with magical twist angle can become superconducting. In our theoretical scenario, the superconductivity coexists with the spin-density-wave-like ordering. Numerical mean-field analysis demonstrates that the spin-density-wave order, which is much stronger than the superconductivity, leaves parts of the Fermi surface ungapped. This Fermi surface serves as a host for the superconductivity. Since the magnetic texture at finite doping breaks the point group of the twisted bilayer graphene, the stabilized superconducting order parameter is nematic. We also explore the possibility of a purely Coulomb-based mechanism of superconductivity in the studied system. The screened Coulomb interaction is calculated within the random phase approximation. It is shown that near the half-filling the renormalized Coulomb repulsion indeed induces the superconducting state, with the order parameter possessing two nodes on the Fermi surface. We estimate the superconducting transition temperature, which turns out to be very low. The implications of our proposal are discussed.</description>

      <title>Hidden symmetry of Bogoliubov de Gennes quasi-particle eigenstates and universal relations in flat band superconducting bipartite lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unconventional flat band (FB) superconductivity, as observed in van der Waals heterostructures, could open promising avenues towards high-T$_c$ materials. In FBs, pairings and superfluid weight scale linearly with the interaction parameter, such an unusual behaviour justifies and encourages strategies to promote FB engineering. Bipartite lattices (BLs) which naturally host FBs could be particularly interesting candidates. Within Bogoliubov de Gennes theory and in the framework of the attractive Hubbard model in BLs, a hidden symmetry of the quasi-particle eigenstates is revealed. As a consequence, we demonstrate universal relations for the pairings and the superfluid weight that are independent of the characteristics of the hopping term. Remarkably, it is shown that these general properties are insensitive to disorder as long as the bipartite character is protected.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures form the foundation of numerous nanoscale physical systems. However, measuring the properties of such heterostructures, and characterizing the semiconductor in-situ is challenging. A recent experimental study [arXiv:2107.03695] was able to probe the semiconductor within the heterostructure using microwave measurements of the superfluid density. This work revealed a rapid depletion of superfluid density in semiconductor, caused by the in-plane magnetic field which in presence of spin-orbit coupling creates so-called Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The experimental work used a simplified theoretical model that neglected the presence of non-magnetic disorder in the semiconductor, hence describing the data only qualitatively. Motivated by experiments, we introduce a theoretical model describing a disordered semiconductor with strong spin-orbit coupling that is proximitized by a superconductor. Our model provides specific predictions for the density of states and superfluid density. Presence of disorder leads to the emergence of a gapless superconducting phase, that may be viewed as a manifestation of Bogoliubov Fermi surface. When applied to real experimental data, our model showcases excellent quantitative agreement, enabling the extraction of material parameters such as mean free path and mobility, and estimating $g$-tensor after taking into account the orbital contribution of magnetic field. Our model can be used to probe in-situ parameters of other superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures and can be further extended to give access to transport properties.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Materials for Josephson {\pi} Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past two decades have seen an explosion of work on Josephson junctions containing ferromagnetic materials. Such junctions are under consideration for applications in digital superconducting logic and memory. In the presence of the exchange field, spin-singlet Cooper pairs from conventional superconductors undergo rapid oscillations in phase as they propagate through a ferromagnetic material. As a result, the ground-state phase difference across a ferromagnetic Josephson junction oscillates between 0 and $\pi$ as a function of the thickness of the ferromagnetic material. $\pi$-junctions have been proposed as circuit elements in superconducting digital logic and in certain qubit designs for quantum computing. If a junction contains two or more ferromagnetic layers whose relative magnetization directions can be controlled by a small applied magnetic field, then the junction can serve as the foundation for a memory cell. Success in all of those applications requires careful choices of ferromagnetic materials. Often, materials that optimize magnetic properties do not optimize supercurrent propagation, and vice versa. In this review we discuss the significant progress that has been made in identifying and testing a wide range of ferromagnetic materials in Josephson junctions over the past two decades. The review concentrates on ferromagnetic metals, partly because eventual industrial applications of ferromagnetic Josephson junctions will most likely start with metallic ferromagnets (either in all metal junctions or junctions containing also an insulating layer). We will briefly mention work on non-metallic barriers, including ferromagnetic insulators, and some of the exciting work on spin-triplet supercurrent in junctions containing noncollinear magnetic inhomogeneity.</description>

      <title>On quantum melting of superfluid vortex crystals: from Lifshitz scalar to dual gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite a long history of studies of vortex crystals in rotating superfluids, their melting due to quantum fluctuations is poorly understood. Here we develop a fracton-elasticity duality to investigate a two-dimensional vortex lattice within the fast rotation regime, where the Lifshitz model of the collective Tkachenko mode serves as the leading-order low-energy effective theory. We incorporate topological defects and discuss several quantum melting scenarios triggered by their proliferation. Furthermore, we lay the groundwork for a dual non-linear emergent gravity description of the superfluid vortex crystals.</description>

      <title>Engineering Majorana bound states in coupled quantum dots in a two-dimensional electron gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Kitaev chains can be used to engineer Majorana bound states (MBSs) in superconductor-semiconductor hybrids. In this work, we realize a two-site Kitaev chain in a two-dimensional electrongas by coupling two quantum dots through a region proximitized by a superconductor. We demonstrate systematic control over inter-dot couplings through in-plane rotations of the magnetic field and via electrostatic gating of the proximitized region. This allows us to tune the system to sweet spots in parameter space, where robust correlated zero bias conductance peaks are observed in tunnelling spectroscopy. To study the extent of hybridization between localized MBSs, we probe the evolution of the energy spectrum with magnetic field and estimate the Majorana polarization, an important metric for Majorana-based qubits. The implementation of a Kitaev chain on a scalable and flexible 2D platform provides a realistic path towards more advanced experiments that require manipulation and readout of multiple MBSs.</description>

We analyze several thermodynamic properties, such as the chemical potential, the energy gap and the superfluid density, taking into account unavoidable quantum fluctuations, and, by means of renormalization group procedure, we detect the putative Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition at finite-size.</description>
