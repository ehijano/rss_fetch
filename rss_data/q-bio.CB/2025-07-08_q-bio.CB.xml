      <title>Human-Guided Feature Selection for Accurate Cardiomyocyte Dysfunction Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early identification of cardiomyocyte dysfunction is a critical challenge for the prognosis of diastolic heart failure (DHF) exhibiting impaired left ventricular relaxation (ILVR). Myocardial relaxation relies strongly on efficient intracellular calcium (${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$) handling. During diastole, a sluggish removal of ${\text{Ca}}^{2+}$ from cardiomyocytes disrupts sarcomere relaxation, leading to ILVR \textit{at the organ level}. Characterizing myocardial relaxation \textit{at the cellular level} requires analyzing both sarcomere length (SL) transients and intracellular calcium kinetics (CK). However, due to the complexity and redundancy in SL and CK data, identifying the most informative features for accurate classification is challenging. To address this, we developed a robust feature selection pipeline involving statistical significance testing (p-values), hierarchical clustering, and feature importance evaluation using random forest (RF) classification to select the most informative features from SL and CK data. SL and CK transients were obtained from prior studies involving a transgenic phospho-ablated mouse model exhibiting ILVR (AAA mice) and wild-type as non-transgenic control mice (NTG). By iteratively refining the feature set, we trained a RF classifier using the selected reduced features. For comparison, we evaluated the performance of the classifier using the full set of original features as well as a dimensionally reduced set derived through principal component analysis (PCA). The confusion matrices demonstrated that the reduced feature set achieved comparable performance to the full feature set and outperformed the PCA-based approach, while offering better interpretability by retaining biologically relevant features. These findings suggest that a small, carefully chosen set of biological features can effectively detect early signs of cardiomyocyte dysfunction.</description>

      <title>The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Information Flow by Dual Reporter System and Its Application to Bacterial Chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mutual information is a theoretically grounded metric for quantifying cellular signaling pathways. However, its measurement demands characterization of both input and output distributions, limiting practical applications. Here, we present alternative method that alleviates this requirement using dual reporter systems. By extending extrinsic-intrinsic noise analysis, we derive a mutual information estimator that eliminates the need to measure input distribution. We demonstrate our method by analyzing the bacterial chemotactic pathway, regarding multiple flagellar motors as natural dual reporters. We show the biological relevance of the measured information flow by comparing it with theoretical bounds on sensory information. This framework opens new possibilities for quantifying information flow in cellular signaling pathways.</description>
