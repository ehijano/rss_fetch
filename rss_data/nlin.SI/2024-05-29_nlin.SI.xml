      <title>Symmetries of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider higher symmetries and operator symmetries of linear partial differential equations. The higher symmetries form a Lie algebra, and operator ones form an associative algebra. The relationship between these symmetries is established. We show that symmetries of linear equations sometimes generate symmetries of nonlinear ones. New symmetries of two-dimensional stationary equations of gas dynamics are found.</description>

      <title>The dynamic of the positons for the reverse space-time nonlocal short pulse equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Darboux transformation (DT) of the reverse space-time (RST) nonlocal short pulse equation is constructed by a hodograph transformation and the eigenfunctions of its Lax pair. The multi-soliton solutions of the RST nonlocal short pulse equation are produced through the DT, which can be expressed in terms of determinant representation. By taking different values of eigenvalues, bounded soliton solutions and unbounded soliton solutions can be obtained. In addition, based on the degenerate Darboux transformation, the $N$-positon solutions of the RST nonlocal short pulse equation are computed from the determinant expression of the multi-soliton solution. Furthermore, different kinds of mixed solutions are also presented, and the interaction properties between positons and solitons are investigated.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear steepest descent on a torus: A case study of the Landau-Lifshitz equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain rigorous large time asymptotics for the Landau-Lifshitz equation in the soliton free case by extending the nonlinear steepest descent method to genus 1 surfaces. The methods presented in this paper pave the way to rigorous analysis of other integrable equations on the torus and enables asymptotic analysis on different regimes of the Landau-Lifshitz equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrable Systems on a Classical Integrable Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the framework for quantum integrable systems on an integrable classical background. We call them hybrid quantum integrable systems (hybrid integrable systems), and we show that they occur naturally in the semiclassical limit of quantum integrable systems. We start with an outline of the concept of hybrid dynamical systems. Then we give several examples of hybrid integrable systems. The first series of examples is a class of hybrid integrable systems that appear in the semiclassical limit of quantum spin chains. Then we look at the semiclassical limit of the quantum spin Calogero--Moser system. The result is a hybrid integrable system driven by usual classical Calogero--Moser (CM) dynamics. This system at the fixed point of the multi-time classical dynamics CM system gives commuting spin Hamiltonians of Haldane--Shastry model.</description>

      <title>Pentagram maps over rings, Grassmannians, and skewers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pentagram map is a discrete dynamical system on planar polygons. By definition, the image of a polygon $P$ under the pentagram map is the polygon $P'$ whose vertices are the intersection points of consecutive shortest diagonals of $P$. The pentagram map was introduced by R. Schwartz in 1992, and is now one of the most renowned discrete integrable systems. Several authors proposed generalizations of the pentagram map to other geometries, in particular to Grassmannians, where the role of points and lines is played by higher-dimensional subspaces, as well to skewer geometry, where both points and lines are affine lines in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the present paper, we develop a common framework for these kinds of generalizations. Specifically, we show that those maps can be viewed as pentagram maps in the projective plane over an appropriate ring. In general, those rings need not be division rings or commutative. We show that the Grassmannian pentagram map corresponds to the ring of matrices, while the skewer map is the pentagram map over the ring of dual numbers. Furthermore, we prove that the pentagram map remains integrable for any stably finite ground ring $R$.</description>
