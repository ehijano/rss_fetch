      <title>Comparisons of multivariate contribution measures of risk contagion and their applications in cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional risk measures and their associated risk contribution measures are commonly employed in finance and actuarial science for evaluating systemic risk and quantifying the effects of risk contagion. This paper introduces various types of contribution measures based on the MCoVaR, MCoES, and MMME studied in Ortega-Jim\'enez et al. (2021) and Das &amp; Fasen-Hartmann (2018) to assess both the absolute and relative effects of a single risk when other risks in a group are in distress. The properties of these contribution risk measures are examined, and sufficient conditions for comparing these measures between two sets of random vectors are established using univariate and multivariate stochastic orders and stochastic dependence notions. Numerical examples are presented for validating the conditions. Finally, a real dataset from the cryptocurrency market is also utilized to analyze the contagion effect in terms of our proposed contribution measures.</description>

      <title>A note on Skew Brownian Motion with two-valued drift and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For skew Brownian motion with two-valued drift, adopting a perturbation approach we find expressions of its potential densities. As applications, we recover its transition density and study its long-time asymptotic behaviors. We also compare with previous results on transition densities for skew Brownian motions. We propose two approaches for generating quasi-random samples by approximating the cumulative distribution function and discussing their risk measurement application.</description>

      <title>Decomposition Pipeline for Large-Scale Portfolio Optimization with Applications to Near-Term Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrially relevant constrained optimization problems, such as portfolio optimization and portfolio rebalancing, are often intractable or difficult to solve exactly. In this work, we propose and benchmark a decomposition pipeline targeting portfolio optimization and rebalancing problems with constraints. The pipeline decomposes the optimization problem into constrained subproblems, which are then solved separately and aggregated to give a final result. Our pipeline includes three main components: preprocessing of correlation matrices based on random matrix theory, modified spectral clustering based on Newman's algorithm, and risk rebalancing. Our empirical results show that our pipeline consistently decomposes real-world portfolio optimization problems into subproblems with a size reduction of approximately 80%. Since subproblems are then solved independently, our pipeline drastically reduces the total computation time for state-of-the-art solvers. Moreover, by decomposing large problems into several smaller subproblems, the pipeline enables the use of near-term quantum devices as solvers, providing a path toward practical utility of quantum computers in portfolio optimization.</description>
