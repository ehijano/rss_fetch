      <title>Euclidean domains with no multiplicative norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Euclidean domain with no multiplicative Euclidean norm to a compatibly well-ordered monoid, and hence with no multiplicative Euclidean norm to $\mathbb{R}$ (under its usual order).
  A key step in the proof is showing that the UFD property is preserved when adjoining a free factorization.</description>

      <title>SAGBI bases of subalgebras arising from finite distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of SAGBI bases was introduced as an analogue of Gr\"{o}bner bases in the context of subalgebras. A Hibi ideal is an ideal of a polynomial ring that arises from a distributive lattice. For the development of an analogy of the theory of Hibi ideals and Gr\"{o}bner bases within the framework of subalgebras, in this paper, we investigate when the set of the polynomials associated with a distributive lattice forms a SAGBI basis of the subalgebras it generates. We characterize such distributive lattices and their underlying posets. In particular, generalized snake posets and $\{(2+2),(1+1+1)\}$-free posets appear as the characterization.</description>

      <title>Noetherian rings of non-local rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rank of a ring $R$ is the supremum of minimal cardinalities of generating sets of $I$, among all ideals $I$ in $R$. In this paper, we obtain a characterization of Noetherian rings $R$ whose rank is not equal to the supremum of ranks of localizations of $R$ at maximal ideals. It turns out that any such ring is a direct product of a finite number of local principal Artinian rings and Dedekind domains, at least one of which is not principal ideal ring. As an application, we show that the rank of the ring of polynomials over an Artinian ring can be computed locally.</description>

      <title>Improvements of convex-dense factorization of bivariate polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new algorithm for factoring a bivariate polynomial $F\in \mathbb{K}[x,y]$ which takes fully advantage of the geometry of the Newton polygon of $F$. Under a non degeneracy hypothesis, the complexity is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(Vr_0^{\omega-1} )$ where $V$ is the volume of the polygon and $r_0$ is its minimal lower lattice length. This improves the complexity $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\omega+1})$ of the classical algorithms which consider the total degree $d$ of $F$ as the main complexity indicator. The integer $r_0\le d$ reflects some combinatorial constraints imposed by the Newton polygon, giving a reasonable and easy-to-compute upper bound for the number of its indecomposable Minkovski summands of positive volume. The proof is based on a new fast factorization algorithm in $\mathbb{K}[[x]][y]$ with respect to a slope valuation, a result which has its own interest.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theorems of Calculus and Zinbiel Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Derivations are linear operators which satisfy the Leibniz rule, while integrations are linear operators which satisfy the Rota-Baxter rule. In this paper, we introduce the notion of an FTC-pair, which consists of an algebra and module with a derivation and integration between them which together satisfy analogues of the two Fundamental Theorems of Calculus. In the special case of when an algebra is seen as a module over itself, we show that this sort of FTC-pair is precisely the same thing as an integro-differential algebra. We provide various constructions of FTC-pairs, as well as numerous examples of FTC-pairs including some based on polynomials, smooth functions, Hurwitz series, and shuffle algebras. Moreover, it is well known that integrations are closely related to Zinbiel algebras. The main result of this paper is that the category of FTC-pairs is equivalent to the category of Zinbiel algebras.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic behaviour of the Vasconcelos invariant for graded modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16358v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of Vasconcelos invariant, known in the literature as v-number, of a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring over a field was introduced in 2020 to study the asymptotic behaviour of the minimum distance of projective Reed-Muller type codes. We initiate the study of this invariant for graded modules. Let $R$ be a Noetherian $\mathbb{N}$-graded ring, and $M$ be a finitely generated graded $R$-module. The v-number $v(M)$ can be defined as the least possible degree of a homogeneous element $x$ of $M$ for which $(0:_Rx)$ is a prime ideal of $R$. For a homogeneous ideal $I$ of $R$, we mainly prove that $v(I^nM)$ and $v(I^nM/I^{n+1}M)$ are eventually linear functions of $n$. In addition, if $(0:_M I)=0$, then $v(M/I^{n}M)$ is also eventually linear with the same leading coefficient as that of $v(I^nM/I^{n+1}M)$. These leading coefficients are described explicitly. The result on the linearity of $v(M/I^{n}M)$ considerably strengthens a recent result of Conca which was shown when $R$ is a domain and $M=R$, and Ficarra-Sgroi where the polynomial case is treated.</description>

      <title>Tame fields, Graded Rings and Finite Complete Sequences of Key Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a criterion for $(K,v)$ to be henselian and defectless in terms of finite complete sequences of key polynomials. For this, we use the theory of Mac Lane-Vaqui\'e chains and abstract key polynomials. We then prove that a valued field $(K,v)$ is tame if and only if $vK$ is $p$-divisible, $Kv$ is perfect and every simple algebraic extension of $K$ admits a finite complete sequence of key polynomials. The properties $vK$ $p$-divisible and $Kv$ perfect are described by the Frobenius endomorphism on the associated graded ring. We also make considerations on simply defectless and algebraically maximal valued fields and purely inertial and purely ramified extensions.</description>
