      <title>On transitive and homogeneous binary $G$-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the notions of transitivity and homogeneity in binary $G$-spaces are studied. These notions coincide for distributive binary $G$-spaces. For compact $G$, it is shown that distributive transitive binary $G$-spaces are coset spaces with a suitably defined binary $G$-action. Homogeneous binary $G$-spaces are topologically homogeneous and are separated into distinct stabilization types. Examples of each type are constructed.</description>

      <title>The Shape of Generating Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topology of a space $X$ is generated by a family $\mathcal{C}$ of its subsets provided that a set $A\subseteq X$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $A\cap C$ is closed in $C$ for each $C\in \mathcal{C}$. A space $X$ is a $k$-space (respectively, sequential) if its topology is generated by the collection of all compact subsets (respectively, convergent sequences) of $X$.
  Relations are defined to capture the notion of a space being a $k$-space or sequential. The structure (or `shape') under the Tukey order of these relations applied to separable metrizable spaces is examined. For the $k$-space case the initial structure is completely determined, and the cofinal structure is shown to be highly complex. In the sequential case, however, the entire shape is determined. It follows that the number of Tukey types in the sequential case lies between $\aleph_0$ and $\mathfrak{c}$, is equal to $\aleph_0$ precisely when $\mathfrak{c} &lt; \aleph_{\omega_1}$, and is equal to $\mathfrak{c}$ if and only if $\mathfrak{c}$ is a fixed point of the aleph function, necessarily of uncountable cofinality.</description>

      <title>Order-generation in posets and convolution of closure operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Hofmann--Lawson theorem, which states that every continuous lattice is inf-generated by its irreducible elements, we explore how to represent posets by extreme points with respect to a closure operator. For this purpose, we introduce the convolution product of closure operators, and prove that the Krein--Milman property can be transferred from one collection of subsets to another by convolution. This result underpins two new representation theorems of topological flavor, which generalize existing ones, even in posets lacking lattice or semilattice structures. We also prove a third representation theorem: given a poset equipped with a closure operator $\mathfrak{c}$ with adequate properties, we show that the set of kit points, defined as an extension of compact points, has the Krein--Milman property with respect to the convolution product of $\mathfrak{c}$ with the dual Alexandrov operator $\uparrow\!\! \cdot$; moreover, every kit point is sup-generated by a unique antichain of compact points, finite if $\mathfrak{c}$ is finitary.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the digital-topological $k$-group structures and the development of the $AP_1$-$k$- and $AP_1^\ast$-$k$-group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the literature of a digital-topological ($DT$-, for brevity) group structure on a digital image $(X,k)$, roughly saying, two kinds of methods are shown. Given a digital image $(X,k)$, the first one, named by a $DT$-$k$-group, was established in 2022 \cite{H10} by using both the $G_{k^\ast}$- or $C_{k^\ast}$-adjacency \cite{H10} for the product $X^2:=X \times X$ and the $(G_{k^\ast},k)$- or $(C_{k^\ast},k)$-continuity for the multiplication $\alpha:X^2 \to X$ \cite{H10}.
  The second one with the name of $NP_i$-$DT$-groups, $i \in \{1,2\}$, was
  discussed in 2023 \cite{LS1} by using the $NP_i(k,k)$-adjacency for $X^2$ in \cite{B1} and the $(NP_i(k,k), k)$-continuities of the multiplication $\alpha:X^2 \to X$, $i\in \{1,2\}$. However, due to some defects of the $NP_u(k_1,k_2, \cdots, k_v)$-adjacency in \cite{B1,B2}, the $AP_u(k_1,k_2, \cdots, k_v)$-adjacency was recently developed as an alternative to the $NP_u(k_1,k_2, \cdots, k_v)$-adjacency (see Section 4). Besides, we also develop an $AP_u^\ast(k_1,k_2, \cdots, k_v)$-adjacency. For a digital image $(X, k)$, in case an $AP_1(k,k)$-($AP_1$-, for simplicity) adjacency on $X^2$ exists, we formulate both an $AP_1$-$k$- and an $AP_1^\ast$-$k$-group. Then we show that an $AP_1^\ast$-$k$-group is equivalent to a Han's $DT$-$k$-group based on both the $C_{k^\ast}$-adjacency on the product $X^2$ and the $(C_{k^\ast}, k)$-continuity for the multiplication $\alpha_1^\prime:(X^2, C_{k^\ast}) \to (X,k)$.</description>

      <title>Submonoids of Infinite Symmetric Inverse Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this thesis we study the subsemigroup structure of the symmetric inverse monoid $I_X$, the inverse semigroup of bijections between subsets of the set $X$, when $X$ is an infinite set. We explore three different approaches to this task. First, we classify the maximal subsemigroups of $I_X$ containing certain subgroups of the symmetric group on $X$. The subgroups in question are the symmetric group itself, the pointwise stabiliser of a finite non-empty subset of $X$, the stabiliser of an ultrafilter on $X$, and the stabiliser of a finite partition of $X$. Next, we study subsemigroups of $I_X$ which are closed in semigroup topologies on $I_X$ introduced by Elliot et al. in 2023. We discover that the closed subsemigroups in these topologies that contain all the idempotents of $I_X$ coincide exactly with semigroups of partial endomorphisms and partial automorphisms of relational structures defined on $X$. Furthermore, we show that if a relational structure $R$ on a countable set $X$ only contains a finite number of relations, then there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that the union of the partial automorphisms of $R$ together with $U$ generates all of $I_X$. Finally, we study the subsemigroup structure of $I_X$ under a preorder introduced by George Bergman and Saharon Shelah in 2006 for the symmetric group. Extending the preorder to $I_X$, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsemigroups of $I_X$, we say that $S_1 \preccurlyeq S_2$ if there exists a finite subset $U$ of $I_X$ such that $S_1$ is contained in the semigroup generated by the union of $S_2$ and $U$. We classify certain types of subsemigroups of $I_X$ according the Bergman-Shelah preorder, and we formulate a conjecture analogous to the main result by Bergman and Shelah.</description>
