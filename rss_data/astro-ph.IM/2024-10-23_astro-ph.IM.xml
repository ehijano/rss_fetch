      <title>Domain-Adaptive Neural Posterior Estimation for Strong Gravitational Lens Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work, we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable future applications of NPE models to real observational data.</description>

      <title>Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA -- Uncertainty and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling of the angular jitter of the spacecraft and their sub-assemblies with the optical bench and the telescope into the interferometric length readout will be a major noise source in the LISA mission. We refer to this noise as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. It will be reduced directly by realignments, and the residual noise will then be subtracted in post-processing. The success of these mitigation strategies depends on an accurate computation of the TTL coupling coefficients. We present here a thorough analysis of the accuracy of the coefficient estimation under different jitter characteristics, angular readout noise levels, and gravitational wave sources. We analyze in which cases the estimates degrade using two estimators, the common least squares estimator and the instrumental variables estimator. Our investigations show that angular readout noise leads to a bias of the least squares estimator, depending on the TTL coupling coefficients, jitter and readout noise level, while the instrumental variable estimator is not biased. We present an equation that predicts the estimation bias of the least squares method due to angular readout noise.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Overall Mission Effectiveness at the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present several use cases for using Generative AI (Gen AI) to improve systems engineering and cognitive knowledge management related to the future of astronomy from a culmination of working meetings and presentations as part of the Gen AI Task Group for the NASA Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) Science and Technology Architecture Review Team (START) AI/ML Working Group. Collectively, our group mission statement is "Where is the Human-in-the-loop as Gen AI systems become more powerful and autonomous?" with an emphasis on the ethical applications of Gen AI, guided by using these systems to remove drudgery from human work while simultaneously increasing opportunities for humans to experience more collective creativity and innovation. The HWO mission stands to benefit dramatically from generative models for different data types including text, time series/spectra, and image data. These cover a wide range of applications in science and engineering for HWO, including: mission development acceleration, data analysis and interpretation, enhancing imaging capabilities, anomaly detection, predictive modeling and simulation, data augmentation for machine learning, instrument calibration and optimization, public engagement and education, and assisting in mission planning. As an example, through sensitivity analysis of simulated exoplanet population science data sets of various generative model complexity, we can reverse engineer the measurement uncertainty requirements for HWO instruments to produce data that can constrain population models and thus inform HWO design requirements. This approach to HWO design is one example of a strategy that can ensure that HWO remains AI-ready. Through presenting herein a combination of visionary ideas balanced with grounded validated use case examples, we aim to support the development of a long-term strategy to keep HWO AI-ready as it moves forward.</description>

      <title>Advancing lunar exploration through virtual reality simulations: a framework for future human missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era marked by renewed interest in lunar exploration and the prospect of establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon, innovative approaches supporting mission preparation and astronaut training are imperative. To this end, the advancements in Virtual Reality (VR) technology offer a promising avenue to simulate and optimize future human missions to the Moon. Through VR simulations, tests can be performed quickly, with different environment parameters and a human-centered perspective can be maintained throughout the experiments. This paper presents a comprehensive framework that harnesses VR simulations to replicate the challenges and opportunities of lunar exploration, aiming to enhance astronaut readiness and mission success. Multiple environments with physical and visual characteristics that reflect those found in interesting Moon regions have been modeled and integrated into simulations based on the Unity graphical engine. We exploit VR to allow the user to fully immerse in the simulations and interact with assets in the same way as in real contexts. Different scenarios have been replicated, from upcoming exploration missions where it is possible to deploy scientific payloads, collect samples, and traverse the surrounding environment, to long-term habitation in a futuristic lunar base, performing everyday activities. Moreover, our framework allows us to simulate human-robot collaboration and surveillance directly displaying sensor readings and scheduled tasks of autonomous agents which will be part of future hybrid missions, leveraging the ROS2-Unity bridge. Thus, the entire project can be summarized as a desire to define cornerstones for human-machine design and interaction, astronaut training, and learning of potential weak points in the context of future lunar missions, through targeted operations in a variety of contexts as close to reality as possible.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Data-Driven Workflows in Radio Interferometry. I. Principal Demonstration in Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to study astrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requires substantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientific information from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration and analysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of procedures as well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choices are typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, an understanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offs between compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what is considered "best practice". A metric of absolute correctness is not always available and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlying principles and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for a given dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists. Our goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, and numerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With these objective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision system that is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processing interferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of the principles behind interferometry and the procedures required for data processing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches and propose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstrated and the results are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present coniferest, an open source generic purpose active anomaly detection framework written in Python. The package design and implemented algorithms are described. Currently, static outlier detection analysis is supported via the Isolation forest algorithm. Moreover, Active Anomaly Discovery (AAD) and Pineforest algorithms are available to tackle active anomaly detection problems. The algorithms and package performance are evaluated on a series of synthetic datasets. We also describe a few success cases which resulted from applying the package to real astronomical data in active anomaly detection tasks within the SNAD project.</description>

      <title>An automated occultation network for gravitational mapping of the trans-neptunian solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of an array of O(100) small fixed telescopes, aligned along a meridian and automated to measure millions of occultations of Gaia stars by minor planets, to constrain gravitational signatures from a "Planet X" mass in the outer solar system. The accuracy of center-of-mass tracking for the occulters is limited by photon noise, uncertainties in asteroid shapes, and Gaia's astrometry of the occulted stars. Using both parametric calculations and survey simulations, we assess the total information obtainable from occultation measurements of main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We find that MBAs are the optimal target population due to their higher occultation rates and abundance of objects above LSST detection thresholds. A 10-year survey of occultations by MBAs and Trojans using an array of 200 40 cm telescopes at 5 km separation would achieve $5\sigma$ sensitivity to the gravitational tidal field of a $5M_\oplus$ Planet X at 800 AU for $&gt;90\%$ of potential sky locations. This configuration corresponds to an initial cost of $\approx $15 million. While the occultation survey's sensitivity to tidal forces improves rapidly with increasing number of telescopes, sensitivity to a Planet X becomes limited by degeneracy with the uncertain masses of large moonless TNOs. The 200-telescope survey would additionally detect $\approx $1800 TNO occultations, providing detailed shape, size, and albedo information. The survey would also measure the Yarkovski effect on many individual MBAs, measure the masses of many asteroids involved in mutual gravitational deflections, and enable better searches for primordial black holes and departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning the gap between real and simulated nebulae: A domain-adaptation approach to classify ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying ionised nebulae in nearby galaxies is crucial to studying stellar feedback mechanisms and understanding the physical conditions of the interstellar medium. This classification task is generally performed by comparing observed line ratios with photoionisation simulations of different types of nebulae (HII regions, planetary nebulae, and supernova remnants). However, due to simplifying assumptions, such simulations are generally unable to fully reproduce the line ratios in observed nebulae. This discrepancy limits the performance of the classical machine-learning approach, where a model is trained on the simulated data and then used to classify real nebulae. In this study, we use a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to bridge the gap between photoionisation models (source domain) and observed ionised nebulae from the PHANGS-MUSE survey (target domain). The DANN is an example of a domain-adaptation algorithm, whose goal is to maximise the performance of a model trained on labelled data in the source domain on an unlabelled target domain by extracting domain-invariant features. Our results indicate a significant improvement in classification performance in the target domain when employing the DANN framework compared to a classical neural network (NN) classifier. Additionally, we investigate the impact of adding noise to the source dataset, finding that noise injection acts as a form of regularisation, further enhancing the performances of both the NN and DANN models on the observational data. The combined use of domain adaptation and noise injection improves the classification accuracy in the target domain by 24%. This study highlights the potential of domain adaptation methods in tackling the domain-shift challenge when using theoretical models to train machine-learning pipelines in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Scalable matched-filtering pipeline for gravitational-wave searches of compact binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As gravitational-wave observations expand in scope and detection rate, the data analysis infrastructure must be modernized to accommodate rising computational demands and ensure sustainability. We present a scalable gravitational-wave search pipeline which modernizes the GstLAL pipeline by adapting the core filtering engine to the PyTorch framework, enabling flexible execution on both Central Processing Units (CPUs) and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Offline search results on the same 8.8 day stretch of public gravitational-wave data indicate that the GstLAL and the PyTorch adaptation demonstrate comparable search performance, even with float16 precision. Lastly, computational benchmarking results show that the GPU float16 configuration of the PyTorch adaptation executed on an A100 GPU can achieve a speedup factor of up to 169 times compared to GstLAL's performance on a single CPU core.</description>

      <title>Lifetimes and Branching Ratios Apparatus (LIBRA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Particle X-ray Coincidence Technique (PXCT) was originally developed to measure average lifetimes in the $10^{-17}-10^{-15}$~s range for proton-unbound states populated by electron capture (EC). We have designed and built the Lifetimes and Branching Ratios Apparatus (LIBRA) to be used in the stopped-beam area at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams that extends PXCT to measure both lifetimes and decay branching ratios of resonances populated by EC/$\beta^+$ decay. The first application of LIBRA aims to obtain essential nuclear data from $^{60}$Ga EC/$\beta^+$ decay to constrain the thermonuclear rates of the $^{59}$Cu$(p,\gamma)^{60}$Zn and $^{59}$Cu$(p,\alpha)^{56}$Ni reactions, and in turn, the strength of the NiCu nucleosynthesis cycle, which is predicted to significantly impact the modeling of Type I X-ray burst light curves and the composition of the burst ashes. Detailed theoretical calculations, Monte Carlo simulations, and performance tests with radioactive sources have been conducted to validate the feasibility of employing LIBRA for the $^{60}$Ga experiment. The method introduced with LIBRA has the potential to measure nearly all essential ingredients for thermonuclear reaction rate calculations in a single experiment, in the absence of direct measurements, which are often impractical for radioactive reactants.</description>

      <title>HWO Yield Sensitivities in the NIR and NUV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will search for biosignatures from Earth-size exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars. The wavelength range for biosignatures used by the HabEx and LUVOIR mission concept studies was 200 nm to 2 microns and, as such, this is a candidate wavelength range for HWO. The visible wavelength range (500-1000 nm) provides for detection of water, oxygen, and Raleigh scattering; the near-ultraviolet is valuable for detection of ozone; and the near-infrared enables detection of carbon dioxide and methane for Earth-like atmospheres. Damiano et al. 2023 showed the significant improvement in spectral retrieval reliability when the NUV and NIR are both used with the visible. However, the challenge of the NUV, in addition to the technological and engineering challenges of starlight suppression in the NUV, is the drop in flux of host stars. In the NIR, the challenge is the geometric access to the habitable zone due to the wavelength dependency of the inner working angle limit of coronagraphs. For these reasons, exoplanet yields are lower in the NUV and NIR than in the visible (Morgan et al. 2023, Morgan et al. 2024) and some instrument parameters are more critical for improving NUV and NIR yields than others. In this paper we present a new capability for performing a large number of end-to-end yield modeling simulations to enable large, multivariate parameter sweeps. We utilize this capability to calculate the Visible, NIR, and NUV yield sensitivities to the instrument parameters: aperture diameter, coronagraph core throughput, contrast, and inner working angle (IWA). We find that parameter interactions are important in determining yield, the most important of which is the interaction between contrast and IWA, but that the strength of that interaction is different in each of the three wavebands.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Sample of Spectra of M-type Stars with Homogeneous Atmospheric-Parameter Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancies between theoretical and observed spectra, and the systematic differences between various spectroscopic parameter estimates, complicate the determination of atmospheric parameters of M-type stars. In this work, we present an empirical sample of 5105 M-type star spectra with homogeneous atmospheric parameter labels through stellar-label transfer and sample cleaning. We addressed systematic discrepancies in spectroscopic parameter estimates by adopting recent results for Gaia EDR3 stars as a reference standard. Then, we used a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise to remove unreliable samples in each subgrid of parameters. To confirm the reliability of the stellar labels, a 5-layer neural network was utilized, randomly partitioning the samples into training and testing sets. The standard deviations between the predicted and actual values in the testing set are 14 K for Teff , 0.06 dex for log g, and 0.05 dex for [M/H], respectively. In addition, we conducted an internal cross-validation to enhance validation and obtained precisions of 11 K, 0.05 dex, and 0.05 dex for Teff , log g, and [M/H], respectively. A grid of 1365 high Signal-to-Noise ratio (S/N) spectra and their labels, selected from the empirical sample, was utilized in the stellar parameter pipeline for M-Type stars (LASPM) of the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), producing an almost seamless Kiel distribution diagram for LAMOST DR10 and DR11 data. The atmospheric parameters for M-type stars from LAMOST DR11 show improved precision compared to the data from DR9, with improvements (for spectra with S/N higher than 10) from 118 to 67 K in Teff , 0.2 to 0.07 dex in log g, and 0.29 to 0.14 dex in [M/H].</description>

      <title>The detectability of high-redshift gamma-ray bursts near-infrared afterglows with CAGIRE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16979</link>

Abstract: Context. Transient sky astronomy is entering a new era with the advent of the SVOM mission (Space Variable Objects Monitor), which was successfully launched on the 26th of June, 2024. The primary goal of SVOM is to monitor the hard X-ray sky searching for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). On top of its on-board follow-up capabilities, SVOM will be backed by its ground segment composed of several facilities, of which the near-infrared imager CAGIRE. Mounted on the robotic telescope COLIBRI, it will be a unique instrument, able to perform fast follow-up of GRB afterglows in J and H bands, an ideal combination to catch high-redshift (z&gt;6) and/or obscured GRBs.
  Aims. This paper aims at estimating the performances of CAGIRE for GRB near-infrared afterglow detection based on the characteristics of the detector and the specificities of the COLIBRI telescope. Quickly fading GRB afterglows pose challenges that should be addressed by adapting observing strategies to the capabilities of CAGIRE.
  Methods. We use an end-to-end image simulator to produce realistic CAGIRE images, taking into account results from the characterization of the ALFA detector used by CAGIRE. We implemented a GRB afterglow generator that simulates infrared lightcurves and spectra based on published observation of distant GRBs (z&gt;6).
  Results. We retrieved the photometry of 9 GRB afterglows in various scenarios covered by CAGIRE. Catching afterglows as early as two minutes after burst allows the identification of a nIR counterpart in the brightest 4 events. When artificially redshifted even further away, these events remain detectable by CAGIRE up to z=9.6 in J band, and z=13.3 in H band, indicating the potential of CAGIRE to be a pioneer in the identification of the most distant GRBs to date.</description>

      <title>Reading Between the Rainbows: Comparative Exoplanet Characterisation through Molecule Agnostic Spectral Clustering</title>

Abstract: Rocky exoplanets are faint and difficult to observe due to their small size and low brightness compared to their host star. Despite this, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has allowed us new methods and opportunities to study them. Accurately characterising exoplanet atmospheres could offer insights not only into the planetary demographics of rocky worlds in the universe, but also how our own Earth compares. Previous work simulating the observational spectra of planets with various models of atmospheric composition has constrained conditions under which specific molecules would be observable. We seek a different approach that does not depend on specific molecular features, but rather on correlating "agnostic" spectral characteristics to each other. This study uses 42 synthetic transit transmission spectra in a range matching that of JWST's MIRI instrument. Spectra were de-noised, normalised and split into bands for which the enclosed areas were calculated. Using the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, separation patterns and clusters were found across these bands, which correlated to various a priori planet characteristics, such as relative gas concentration. Using 0.7 $\mu$m bands between 7 and 12 $\mu$m, we are able to separate reducing vs. oxic atmospheres and constrain CO$_2$ and O$_2$ mixing ratios accurate to within two orders of magnitude in an unknown sample. Through this, we have demonstrated that it is possible to differentiate and analyse exoplanet atmosphere type from agnostic interrogation of their transit spectra with a method we call "Molecule Agnostic Spectral Clustering".</description>

      <title>The search for NEOs as potential candidates for use in space missions to Venus and Mars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyzed the orbits of more than 35,000 (for 2024) near-Earth objects (NEOs) for the possibility of successive approaches to all pairs of planets: Earth, Venus, and Mars in the time range from 2020 to 2120. We have selected 120 candidates for Earth-Mars, Earth-Venus, Mars-Earth, Mars-Venus, Venus-Earth, and Venus-Mars fast transfers (within 180 days); 2 candidates for double transfers (consecutive approaches with three planets); 10 candidates for multiple transfers, when an asteroid has several consecutive paired approaches to planets in a hundred years.</description>

      <title>Improving DM estimates using low-frequency scattering-broadening estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pulsar's pulse profile gets broadened at low frequencies due to dispersion along the line of sight or due to multi-path propagation. The dynamic nature of the interstellar medium makes both of these effects time-dependent and introduces slowly varying time delays in the measured times-of-arrival similar to those introduced by passing gravitational waves. In this article, we present an improved method to correct for such delays by obtaining unbiased dispersion measure (DM) measurements by using low-frequency estimates of the scattering parameters. We evaluate this method by comparing the obtained DM estimates with those, where scatter-broadening is ignored using simulated data. A bias is seen in the estimated DMs for simulated data with pulse-broadening with a larger variability for a data set with a variable frequency scaling index, $\alpha$, as compared to that assuming a Kolmogorov turbulence. Application of the proposed method removes this bias robustly for data with band averaged signal-to-noise ratio larger than 100. We report the measurements of the scatter-broadening time and $\alpha$ from analysis of PSR J1643$-$1224, observed with upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment. These scattering parameters were found to vary with epoch and $\alpha$ was different from that expected for Kolmogorov turbulence. Finally, we present the DM time-series after application of this technique to PSR J1643$-$1224.</description>

      <title>Statistical estimation of full-sky radio maps from 21cm array visibility data using Gaussian constrained realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important application of next-generation wide-field radio interferometers is making high dynamic range maps of radio emission. Traditional deconvolution methods like CLEAN can give poor recovery of diffuse structure, prompting the development of wide-field alternatives like Direct Optimal Mapping and $m$-mode analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative Bayesian method to infer the coefficients of a full-sky spherical harmonic basis for a drift-scan telescope with potentially thousands of baselines, that can precisely encode the uncertainties and correlations between the parameters used to build the recovered image. We use Gaussian constrained realizations (GCR) to efficiently draw samples of the spherical harmonic coefficients, despite the very large parameter space and extensive sky-regions of missing data. Each GCR solution provides a complete, statistically-consistent gap-free realization of a full-sky map conditioned on the available data, even when the interferometer's field of view is small. Many realizations can be generated and used for further analysis and robust propagation of statistical uncertainties. In this paper, we present the mathematical formalism of the spherical harmonic GCR-method for radio interferometers. We focus on the recovery of diffuse emission as a use case, along with validation of the method against simulations with a known diffuse emission component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source CUDA-based package that consists of a compilation of exponential integrators where the action of the matrix exponential or the $\varphi_l$ functions on a vector is approximated using the method of polynomial interpolation at Leja points. Using a couple of test examples on an NVIDIA A100 GPU, we show that one can achieve significant speedups using CUDA over the corresponding CPU code. LeXInt, written in a modular format, facilitates easy integration into any existing software package, and can be used for temporal integration of any differential equation.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian, post-Born, three-dimensional, on-the-fly ray tracing algorithm for gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12913v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analyses of the next generation cosmological surveys demand an accurate, efficient, and differentiable method for simulating the universe and its observables across cosmological volumes. We present Hamiltonian ray tracing (HRT) -- the first post-Born (accounting for lens-lens coupling and without relying on the Born approximation), three-dimensional (without assuming the thin-lens approximation), and on-the-fly (applicable to any structure formation simulations) ray tracing algorithm based on the Hamiltonian formalism. HRT performs symplectic integration of the photon geodesics in a weak gravitational field, and can integrate tightly with any gravity solver, enabling co-evolution of matter particles and light rays with minimal additional computations. We implement HRT in the particle-mesh library $\texttt{pmwd}$, leveraging hardware accelerators such as GPUs and automatic differentiation capabilities based on $\texttt{JAX}$. When tested on a point-mass lens, HRT achieves sub-percent accuracy in deflection angles above the resolution limit across both weak and moderately strong lensing regimes. We also test HRT in cosmological simulations on the convergence maps and their power spectra.</description>

      <title>Evaluating potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a multi-criteria decision making approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The selection of a landing site within the Artemis Exploration Zone (AEZ) involves multiple factors and presents a complex problem. This study evaluates potential landing sites for the Artemis III mission using a combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) methodologies, specifically the TOPSIS algorithm. By integrating topographic, illumination, and mineralogy data of the Moon, we assess 1247 locations that meet the Human Landing System (HLS) requirements within 13 candidate regions and Site 004 near the lunar south pole. Criteria considered include surface visibility, HLS-astronaut line of sight, Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs), sunlight exposure, direct communication with Earth, geological units, and mafic mineral abundance. Site DM2 (Nobile Rim 2), particularly the point at latitude 84{\deg}12'5.61" S (-84.20156{\deg}) and longitude 60{\deg}41'59.61" E (60.69989{\deg}), is the optimal location for landing. Sensitivity analysis confirms the robustness of our approach, validating the suitability of the best location despite the MCDM method employed and variations in criteria weightings to prioritize illumination and PSRs. This research demonstrates the applicability of GIS-MCDM techniques for lunar exploration and the potential benefits they can bring to the Artemis program.</description>

      <title>ASTRODEEP-JWST: NIRCam-HST multiband photometry and redshifts for half a million sources in six extragalactic deep fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a set of photometric catalogs primarily aimed at providing the community with a comprehensive database for the study of galaxy populations in the high redshift Universe. The set gathers data from eight JWST NIRCam observational programs, targeting the Abell 2744 (GLASS-JWST, UNCOVER, DDT2756 and GO3990), EGS (CEERS), COSMOS and UDS (PRIMER), and GOODS North and South (JADES and NGDEEP) deep fields, for a total area of $\sim$0.2 sq. degrees. Photometric estimates are obtained by means of well-established techniques, including tailored improvements designed to enhance the performance on the specific dataset. We also include new measurements from HST archival data, thus collecting 16 bands spanning from 0.44 to 4.44 $\mu$m. A grand total of $\sim$530 thousand sources is detected on stacks of NIRCam 3.56 and 4.44 $\mu$m mosaics. We assess the photometric accuracy by comparing fluxes and colors against archival catalogs. We also provide photometric redshift estimates, statistically validated against a large set of robust spectroscopic data. The catalogs are publicly available on the Astrodeep website.</description>
