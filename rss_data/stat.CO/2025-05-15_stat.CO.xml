      <title>Independent Component Analysis by Robust Distance Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful tool for decomposing a multivariate signal or distribution into fully independent sources, not just uncorrelated ones. Unfortunately, most approaches to ICA are not robust against outliers. Here we propose a robust ICA method called RICA, which estimates the components by minimizing a robust measure of dependence between multivariate random variables. The dependence measure used is the distance correlation (dCor). In order to make it more robust we first apply a new transformation called the bowl transform, which is bounded, one-to-one, continuous, and maps far outliers to points close to the origin. This preserves the crucial property that a zero dCor implies independence. RICA estimates the independent sources sequentially, by looking for the component that has the smallest dCor with the remainder. RICA is strongly consistent and has the usual parametric rate of convergence. Its robustness is investigated by a simulation study, in which it generally outperforms its competitors. The method is illustrated on three applications, including the well-known cocktail party problem.</description>

      <title>Bayesian computation with generative diffusion models by Multilevel Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful strategy to perform stochastic sampling in Bayesian inverse problems, delivering remarkably accurate solutions for a wide range of challenging applications. However, diffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations per sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using diffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian computation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in applications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for conducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in large-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large neural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging applications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy that significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion models. This is achieved by exploiting cost-accuracy trade-offs inherent to diffusion models to carefully couple models of different levels of accuracy in a manner that significantly reduces the overall cost of the calculation, without reducing the final accuracy. The proposed approach achieves a $4\times$-to-$8\times$ reduction in computational cost w.r.t. standard techniques across three benchmark imaging problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prior Calibration From Indirect Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inversion is central to the quantification of uncertainty within problems arising from numerous applications in science and engineering. To formulate the approach, four ingredients are required: a forward model mapping the unknown parameter to an element of a solution space, often the solution space for a differential equation; an observation operator mapping an element of the solution space to the data space; a noise model describing how noise pollutes the observations; and a prior model describing knowledge about the unknown parameter before the data is acquired. This paper is concerned with learning the prior model from data; in particular, learning the prior from multiple realizations of indirect data obtained through the noisy observation process. The prior is represented, using a generative model, as the pushforward of a Gaussian in a latent space; the pushforward map is learned by minimizing an appropriate loss function. A metric that is well-defined under empirical approximation is used to define the loss function for the pushforward map to make an implementable methodology. Furthermore, an efficient residual-based neural operator approximation of the forward model is proposed and it is shown that this may be learned concurrently with the pushforward map, using a bilevel optimization formulation of the problem; this use of neural operator approximation has the potential to make prior learning from indirect data more computationally efficient, especially when the observation process is expensive, non-smooth or not known. The ideas are illustrated with the Darcy flow inverse problem of finding permeability from piezometric head measurements.</description>
