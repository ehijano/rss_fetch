      <title>Hovering Sets in Near Pseudo-Integrable Hamiltonian Impact Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from rotational to discontinuous behavior of the return map of the perturbed oscillators-step system, a paradigm model for a perturbation of a pseudo-integrable Hamiltonian impact system, is studied. The form of the return map is derived, and a truncated form of this map is simulated and analyzed. For a set of parameters the existence of a hovering set, a set of non-resonant orbits that pass sometimes above the step and sometimes to its side, without ever impacting it, is established and quantified. Its destruction as the sign of the perturbation term is reversed is established.</description>

      <title>Order from chaos with adaptive circuits on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Programmable quantum devices provide a platform to control the coherent dynamics of quantum wavefunctions. Here we experimentally realize adaptive monitored quantum circuits, which incorporate conditional feedback into non-unitary evolution, to control quantum chaotic dynamics using a combination of local mid-circuit measurements and resets. The experiments are performed with an IBM superconducting quantum processor using up to 100 qubits that samples a quantum version of the classically chaotic Bernoulli map. This map scrambles quantum information, while local measurements and feedback attempt to steer the dynamics toward a state that is a fixed point of the map. This competition drives a dynamical phase transition between quantum and classical dynamics that we observe experimentally and describe theoretically using noisy simulations, matrix product states, and mappings to statistical mechanics models. Estimates of the universal critical properties are obtained to high accuracy on the quantum computer thanks to the large number of qubits utilized in the calculation. By successfully applying up to nearly 5000 entangling gates and 5000 non-unitary mid-circuit operations on systems up to 100 qubits, this experiment serves as a signpost on the route towards fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Interplay of blowups in a differential kinetic model of gravity wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the blowup scenarios in a novel phase-parametrized differential approximation model of deep water surface gravity waves that was recently derived in the limit of a large number of multicomponent fields. Previous work showed that upon precisely tuning the phase parameter $\phi$ to $\pi$, the model formally supports steady-state solutions transitioning from Kolmogorov-Zakharov $\propto \omega^{-4}$ to Phillips' critical balance $\propto \omega^{-5}$ at small scales, a feature qualitatively consistent with oceanic measurements. Here we show that the critical balance is in fact a generic feature of the model, which prescribes a finite-time transfer of the energy from the IR towards the UV for any value of $\phi \in [0,\pi)$. We observe a bifurcation in the blowup scenario from continuous to discrete self-similarity as $\phi$ is increased above $\phi_*\simeq 2.7$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a non-continuous blowup in the kinetic theory of waves.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the Network Topology of a Linear Reservoir Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction, and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks. Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of a reservoir computer (RC) is generated at random, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on optimizing the topology of a linear RC to improve its performance and interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both the training and testing phases and also often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent RC architectures.</description>

      <title>An operator-Weyl-symbol approach to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, by an approach that employs Weyl symbols for operators, a semiclassical theory is developed for the offdiagonal function in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which is for offdiagonal elements $\langle{E_i}\left|O\right|{E_j}\rangle$ of an observable $O$ on the energy basis. It is shown analytically that the matrix of $O$ has a banded structure, possessing a bandwidth $w_b$ that scales linearly with $\hbar$, a phase-space gradient of the classical Hamiltonian, $\langle\left|{\boldsymbol{\nabla }H_{\rm cl}}\right|\rangle$, and an $O$-dependent property. This predicts that the thermalization timescale of a quantum system may be inversely proportional to the phase-space gradient of the Hamiltonian, aligning with intuitions in classical thermalization. This approach also elucidates the origin of a $\rho_{\rm dos}^{-1/2}$-scaling of the offdiagonal function. The analytical predictions are checked numerically in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model.</description>

      <title>Event-based complexity in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the studies of Kolmogorov and Oboukhov in 1941, the problem of intermittent large velocity excursions was recognized to be one of the most intriguing and elusive aspects of turbulent flows. While many efforts were devoted since 1960s to the magnitude intermittency, related to the statistics of the large increments in the turbulent signals, the attention towards the so-called clustering intermittency has started to increase only in the last two decades, even if some pioneering studies were carried in previous years. The low attention towards the clustering intermittency is somewhat surprising, as intermittency itself is essentially defined as an alternance of extended quiescent periods/regions and short/small high activity periods/zones. It is then natural to characterize intermittency by means of events marked along the dependent variable axes, whatever time or space. Conversely, the concept of crucial events and of temporal complexity, related to non-trivial clustering properties of these same events, has been proposed as a general interpretative framework for the investigation of complex systems with metastable self-organizing dynamics. Without any claim to being complete, in this chapter we give a review of event-based complexity approaches used in literature for the description of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. The main goal is to put a first bridge between turbulence studies exploiting event-based complexity approaches, such as clustering exponents and classical Oboukhov intermittency exponents, and studies about intermittent complex systems, where concepts and ideas developed in the fields of non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory and dynamical system theory are jointly exploited.</description>

      <title>Information theory for data-driven model reduction in physics and biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is the construction of simple yet predictive descriptions of the dynamics of many-body systems in terms of a few relevant variables. A prerequisite to model reduction is the identification of these variables, a task for which no general method exists. Here, we develop an approach to identify relevant variables, defined as those most predictive of the future, using the so-called information bottleneck. We elucidate analytically the relation between these relevant variables and the eigenfunctions of the transfer operator describing the dynamics. In the limit of high compression, the relevant variables are directly determined by the slowest-decaying eigenfunctions. Our results provide a firm foundation to interpret deep learning tools that automatically identify reduced variables. Combined with equation learning methods this procedure yields the hidden dynamical rules governing the system's evolution in a data-driven manner. We illustrate how these tools work in diverse settings including model chaotic and quasiperiodic systems in which we also learn the underlying dynamical equations, uncurated satellite recordings of atmospheric fluid flows, and experimental videos of cyanobacteria colonies in which we discover an emergent synchronization order parameter.</description>

      <title>Invariant Measures in Time-Delay Coordinates for Unique Dynamical System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While invariant measures are widely employed to analyze physical systems when a direct study of pointwise trajectories is intractable, e.g., due to chaos or noise, they cannot uniquely identify the underlying dynamics. Our first result shows that, in contrast to invariant measures in state coordinates, e.g., $[x(t), y(t), z(t)]$, the invariant measure expressed in time-delay coordinates, e.g., $[x(t), x(t-\tau),\ldots, x(t-(m-1)\tau)]$, can identify the dynamics up to a topological conjugacy. Our second result resolves the remaining ambiguity: by combining invariant measures constructed from multiple delay frames with distinct observables, the system is uniquely identifiable, provided that a suitable initial condition is satisfied. These guarantees require informative observables and appropriate delay parameters ($m,\tau$), which can be limiting in certain settings. We support our theoretical contributions through a series of physical examples demonstrating how invariant measures expressed in delay-coordinates can be used to perform robust system identification in practice.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.</description>
