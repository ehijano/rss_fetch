      <title>Deviation Inequalities for R\'{e}nyi Divergence Estimators via Variational Expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R\'enyi divergences play a pivotal role in information theory, statistics, and machine learning. While several estimators of these divergences have been proposed in the literature with their consistency properties established and minimax convergence rates quantified, existing accounts of probabilistic bounds governing the estimation error are premature. Here, we make progress in this regard by establishing exponential deviation inequalities for smoothed plug-in estimators and neural estimators by relating the error to an appropriate empirical process and leveraging tools from empirical process theory. In particular, our approach does not require the underlying distributions to be compactly supported or have densities bounded away from zero, an assumption prevalent in existing results. The deviation inequality also leads to a one-sided concentration bound from the expectation, which is useful in random-coding arguments over continuous alphabets in information theory with potential applications to physical-layer security. As another concrete application, we consider a hypothesis testing framework for auditing R\'{e}nyi differential privacy using the neural estimator as a test statistic and obtain non-asymptotic performance guarantees for such a test.</description>

      <title>Hermitian Self-dual Twisted Generalized Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-dual maximum distance separable (MDS) codes over finite fields are linear codes with significant combinatorial and cryptographic applications. Twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes can be both MDS and self-dual. In this paper, we study a general class of TGRS codes (A-TGRS), which encompasses all previously known special cases. First, we establish a sufficient and necessary condition for an A-TGRS code to be Hermitian self-dual. Furthermore, we present four constructions of self-dual TGRS codes, which, to the best of our knowledge, nearly cover all the related results previously reported in the literature. More importantly, we also obtain several new classes of Hermitian self-dual TGRS codes with flexible parameters. Based on this framework, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition for an A-TGRS code to be Hermitian self-dual and MDS. In addition, we construct a class of MDS Hermitian self-dual TGRS code by appropriately selecting the evaluation points. This work investigates the Hermitian self-duality of TGRS codes from the perspective of matrix representation, leading to more concise and transparent analysis. More generally, the Euclidean self-dual TGRS codes and the Hermitian self-dual GRS codes can also be understood easily from this point.</description>

      <title>Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface with Element-Level Pattern Reconfigurability: Beamforming and Pattern Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pattern-reconfigurable fluid reconfigurable intelligent surface (FRIS) framework, where each fluid element can dynamically adjust its radiation pattern based on instantaneous channel conditions. To evaluate its potential, we first conduct a comparative analysis of the received signal power in point-to-point communication systems assisted by three types of surfaces: (1) the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS, (2) a position-reconfigurable FRIS, and (3) a conventional RIS. Theoretical results demonstrate that the pattern-reconfigurable FRIS provides a significant advantage in modulating transmission signals compared to the other two configurations. To further study its capabilities, we extend the framework to a multiuser communication scenario. In this context, the spherical harmonics orthogonal decomposition (SHOD) method is employed to accurately model the radiation patterns of individual fluid elements, making the pattern design process more tractable. An optimization problem is then formulated with the objective of maximizing the weighted sum rate among users by jointly designing the active beamforming vectors and the spherical harmonics coefficients, subject to both transmit power and pattern energy constraints. To tackle the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm that alternates between a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) approach for active beamforming and a Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) method for updating the spherical harmonics coefficients. Simulation results show that the proposed pattern-reconfigurable FRIS significantly outperforms traditional RIS architectures based on the 3GPP 38.901 and isotropic radiation models, achieving average performance gains of 161.5% and 176.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>ORCAS Codes: A Flexible Generalization of Polar Codes with Low-Complexity Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for channel codes with low-complexity soft-decision decoding algorithms, we consider the recursive Plotkin concatenation of optimal low-rate and high-rate codes based on simplex codes and their duals. These component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding. As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS) codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes. For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility in codeword length than conventional polar codes.</description>

      <title>Non-Orthogonal Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing for Spectrally Efficient High-Mobility Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel non-orthogonal affine frequency division multiplexing {(nAFDM)} waveform for reliable high-mobility communications with enhanced spectral efficiency {(SE)}. The key idea is {to introduce} a bandwidth compression factor into the AFDM {modulator} to enable controllable subcarrier overlapping. We first {detail the proposed nAFDM transceiver} and derive the corresponding input-output {signal} relationship. Then, an efficient {nAFDM} signal generation method based on the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) is proposed, enabling practical implementation using existing inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) modules without additional hardware complexity. Next, to characterize the impact of non-orthogonal modulation, we derive a closed-form expression {of} inter-carrier interference (ICI), showing its dependence on the bandwidth compression factor. To mitigate the resulting interference, we propose a soft iterative detection algorithm and a low-complexity implementation approach that leverages the distribution characteristics of ICI. {Simulation results demonstrate that 1) in terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed nAFDM can achieve near identical BER compared to conventional AFDM, while outperforms other waveform counterparts; 2) nAFDM is capable of striking higher SE compared to other existing waveforms; and 3) the proposed nAFDM achieves an attractive BER vs. SE trade-off, and the proposed soft ID scheme can attain a trade-off between BER and complexity.}</description>

      <title>Unified Design of Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Maritime Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of maritime activities, it is expected to provide seamless communications with quality of service (QoS) guarantee over broad sea area. In the context, this paper proposes a space-air-ground-sea integrated maritime communication architecture combining satellite, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), terrestrial base station (TBS) and unmanned surface vessel (USV). Firstly, according to the distance away from the shore, the whole marine space is divided to coastal area, offshore area, middle-sea area and open-sea area, the maritime users in which are served by TBS, USV, UAV and satellite, respectively. Then, by exploiting the potential of integrated maritime communication system, a joint beamforming and trajectory optimization algorithm is designed to maximize the minimum transmission rate of maritime users. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Parallel repetition of expanded, and multiplayer, Quantum games: anchoring, optimal values, generalized error bounds, dependency-breaking as symmetry-breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that parallel repetition of the multiplayer anchored optimal value, $\omega \big( G_{\bot} \big)^{\otimes n}$, decays exponentially. Central to our approach are several probabilistic computations, pertaining to: (1) the computation of expected values for quantifying how the winning probability of the game is likely to change under the anchoring transformation; (2) the computation of positive operator valued measurements, which can be placed into direct correspondence with several probabilistically defined quantities; (3) the computation of Relative, and Relative-min entropies; (4) and lastly, the computation of generalized error bounds, which have previously been analyzed by the author in several multiplayer game-theoretic settings (arXiv: 2505.06322, and arXiv: 2507.03035). This work builds upon observations originally provided by Bavarian, Vidick, and Yuen (arXiv: 1509.07466).</description>

      <title>Global Convergence Analysis of Vanilla Gradient Descent for Asymmetric Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem, which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence. However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.</description>

      <title>Directed Cycles as Higher-Order Units of Information Processing in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed cycles form the fundamental motifs in natural, social and artificial networks, yet their distinct computational roles remain under-explored, particularly in the context of higher-order structure and function. In this work, we investigate how two types of directed cycles - feedforward and feedback - can act as higher-order structures to facilitate the flow and integration of information in sparse random networks, and how these roles depend on the environment of the cycles. Using information-theoretic measures, we show that network size, sparsity and relative directionality critically impact the information-processing capacities of directed cycles. In a network with no-preferred global direction, a feedforward cycle enables greater information flow and a feedback cycle allows for increased information integration. The relative direction of a feedforward cycle as well as the structural incoherence it induces, determines its capacity to generate higher-order behaviour. Finally, we demonstrate that introducing feedback loops into otherwise feedforward architectures increases the diversity of network activity patterns. These findings suggest that directed cycles serve as computational motifs with local information processing capabilities that depend on the structure they are embedded. Using directed cycles, we highlight the interdependence between higher-order structures and the higher-order order behaviour they can induce in the network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Improving quantum communication rates with permutation-invariant codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we improve the quantum communication rates of various quantum channels of interest using permutation-invariant quantum codes. We focus in particular on parametrized families of quantum channels and aim to improve bounds on their quantum capacity threshold, defined as the lowest noise level at which the quantum capacity of the channel family vanishes. These thresholds are important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful quantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact that independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any permutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output states can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the symmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient algorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a permutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent information values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100 channel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically relevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure channel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing channel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their quantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we significantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in [Fern, Whaley 2008]. These threshold improvements are achieved using a repetition code-like input state with non-orthogonal code states, which we further analyze in our representation-theoretic framework.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of double and four circulant codes, which are quasi-cyclic codes of index two and four respectively. Exact enumeration results are derived for these families of codes with the prescribed hull dimension. These formulas, in turn, are the most used tools to prove the good behavior of double circulant and four circulant codes asymptotically. Computational results on the code families in consideration are provided as well.</description>

      <title>On the Service Rate Region of Reed-Muller Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13105v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Service Rate Region of Reed-Muller codes in the context of distributed storage systems. The service rate region is a convex polytope comprising all achievable data access request rates under a given coding scheme. It represents a critical metric for evaluating system efficiency and scalability. Using the geometric properties of Reed-Muller codes, we characterize recovery sets for data objects, including their existence, uniqueness, and enumeration. This analysis reveals a connection between recovery sets and minimum-weight codewords in the dual Reed-Muller code, providing a framework for identifying those recovery sets. Leveraging these results, we derive explicit and tight bounds on the maximal achievable demand for individual data objects, thereby defining the maximal simplex within the service rate region and the smallest simplex containing it. These two provide a tight approximation of the service rate region of Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum-classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

      <title>The vast world of quantum advantage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to identify quantum advantages lies at the heart of quantum technology. While quantum devices promise extraordinary capabilities, from exponential computational speedups to unprecedented measurement precision, distinguishing genuine advantages from mere illusions remains a formidable challenge. In this endeavor, quantum theorists are like prophets attempting to foretell the future, yet the boundary between visionary insight and unfounded fantasy is perilously thin. In this perspective, we examine our mathematical tools for navigating the vast world of quantum advantages across computation, learning, sensing, and communication. We explore five keystone properties: predictability, typicality, robustness, verifiability, and usefulness that define an ideal quantum advantage, and envision what new quantum advantages could arise in a future with ubiquitous quantum technology. We prove that some quantum advantages are inherently unpredictable using classical resources alone, suggesting a landscape far richer than what we can currently foresee. While mathematical rigor remains our indispensable guide, the ultimate power of quantum technologies may emerge from advantages we cannot yet conceive.</description>
