      <title>Emergent Inductance from Chiral Orbital Currents in a Bulk Ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a new form of inductance in the bulk ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6, which features strong spin-orbit coupling, large magnetic anisotropy, and pronounced magnetoelastic interactions. Below its Curie temperature, Mn3Si2Te6 hosts chiral orbital currents (COC) that circulate within the crystal lattice and give rise to collective electronic behavior [1]. By applying a magnetic field along the hard c axis and driving the system with low-frequency currents, we uncover a giant inductive response up to millihenry scale, originating from first-order reconfigurations of COC domains. These domains act as coherent mesoscopic inductive elements that resist reversal upon current reduction, producing a large electromotive force and sharply increasing voltage. This emergent inductance defies classical models, occurs without superconductivity or engineered nanostructures, and opens a new frontier in orbital-based quantum functionality and device concepts.</description>

      <title>Le Chatelier principle and field-induced change in magnetic entropy leading to spin lattice partitioning and magnetization plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a certain antiferromagnet, the magnetization does not increase gradually with increasing magnetic field but exhibits field region(s) typically at an integer fraction of its saturation magnetization. This phenomenon is understood by the supposition that such an antiferromagnet undergoes field-induced partitioning of its spin lattice into ferrimagnetic fragments. We searched for a theoretical basis for this supposition by investigating how external magnetic fields affect the magnetic entropy of such an antiferromagnet, to find that the field region of the magnetization plateau has a single magnetic phase, but a nonzero slope region of the magnetization curve has two magnetic phases of different magnetic entropy, and that the magnetic entropy of a single-phase region does not depend on magnetic field but that of a two-phase region does. We tested these predictions by carrying out magnetization and specific heat measurements for g-Mn3(PO4)2. It was found that the magnetic entropy of the two-phase region increases with field, indicating that field-induced breaking of magnetic bonds and hence field-induced partitioning of an antiferromagnetic spin lattice are time-averaged results of all allowed spin arrangements that occur repeatedly during static magnetization measurements. The temperature-dependent magnetic specific heats of g-Mn3(PO4)2 between 2 - 6 K shows a larger excitation gap when measured at 9 T than at 0 T, suggesting that these energy gaps reflect the two successive local excitations of linear Mn2+-Mn2+-Mn2+ ferrimagnetic trimers embedded in the antiferromagnetic spin lattice of g-Mn3(PO4)2 and arise from the Boltzmann factor associated with these excitations</description>

      <title>Interaction-driven quantum criticality in two-dimensional quadratic band crossing semimetals with time-reversal symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of all sixteen marginally relevant fermion-fermion interactions in two-dimensional time-reversal symmetry-breaking kagom\'{e} semimetals hosting a quadratic band crossing point. Employing a momentum-shell renormalization group approach that treats every interaction on equal footing, we derive energy-dependent flow equations that capture the hierarchical evolutions of interaction parameters. Our analysis begins by tracking the energy-dependent flows of fermion-fermion interactions. The interaction couplings go towards divergence at a critical energy scale, signaling quantum critical behavior. Such behavior is characterized by a certain fixed point (FP) whose characteristics depends intimately on structural parameters $d_{0,1,2,3}$ that cluster the microscopic model into rotationally symmetric and asymmetric cases. Then, we identify two stable FPs in the rotationally symmetric and nine additional FPs in asymmetric case dubbed FP$_{1-10}$. Their boundary conditions are approximately demarcated and established by linear and plane fitting techniques in the structural parameter space. Furthermore, we examine distinct interaction-driven instabilities nearby these FPs by incorporating the relevant external source terms and computing their susceptibilities. It indicates that the charge density wave and superconductivity become dominant at FP$_{2,4,5,6,8}$ and FP$_{1,9,10}$, while the $x$-current and bond density prevail at FP$_3$ and FP$_7$, respectively. In addition to these leading states, several underlying subordinate instabilities are presented as well. These results would be helpful to further study the low-energy critical behavior in 2D kagom\'{e} QBCP and related materials.</description>

      <title>Giant Splitting of Folded Dirac Bands in Kekul\'{e}-ordered Graphene with Eu Intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene on SiC realized by intercalating two-dimensional metal layers offers a versatile platform for exploring intriguing quantum states and phenomena. Here, we achieve the intercalation of $(\mathrm{\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}})\mathit{R}30^\circ$-ordered Eu layer between epitaxial graphene and SiC substrate, realizing a Kekul\'{e} graphene with large local magnetic moments of intercalated Eu atoms. Combining angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we revealed that the Kekul{\'{e}} order folds the Dirac cones of graphene from the corners to the Brillouin zone center via intervalley scattering, forming the replica Dirac bands with gap opening. More intriguingly, the Dirac fermions in the replica Dirac bands show a strong exchange coupling with the localized magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ orbitals, resulting in a giant splitting of the folded Dirac bands. The observation of strong coupling between Dirac fermions and local magnetic moments of Eu $4f$ electrons via Kekul\'{e} order pave a new way for generating Dirac band splitting in graphene, advancing the potential applications of Kekul\'{e}-ordered graphene in spintronics, as well as exploring intriguing physical properties and correlation states for quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Exact many-body wavefunction of the Kondo model with time-dependent interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the nonstationary Schrodinger equation for the Kondo Hamiltonian with a time-dependent spin-exchange coupling $J(t)$ under periodic boundary conditions. Unlike previously studied time-dependent integrable models, which are rooted in the classical Yang-Baxter structure and associated Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, our approach is based on the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov framework and the quantum Yang-Baxter algebra. We demonstrate that the dynamics is integrable for a class of exchange couplings $J(t)$ of the form $\lambda t + p(t) \pm \sqrt{(\lambda t + p(t))^2 + 4/3}$, where $p(t)$ is an arbitrary periodic function, and construct the corresponding many-body wavefunction. We also discuss extensions to other one-dimensional integrable models with linear dispersion, such as Gross-Neveu and Thirring. Our results broaden the domain of time-dependent integrability to a genuinely quantum class of models and provide a new platform for exploring coherent nonequilibrium dynamics in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phases in a Two-Dimensional Generalized interacting SSH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study interaction-driven quantum phases in a two-dimensional generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) defined on a square lattice with inequivalent nearest-neighbor hopping, next-nearest-neighbor hopping and a staggered on-site potential. In the non-interacting limit, the model hosts either a quadratic band touching (QBT) at the Brillouin-zone center or symmetry-protected Dirac nodes, depending on microscopic parameters. In the parameter regime with a QBT, our self-consistent Hartree-Fock analysis shows that weak to intermediate interactions can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and stabilize a quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulating phase with a finite Chern number. Interestingly, this QAH phase is found to weakly break lattice-symmetries, leading to a small but finite nematic bond order. This is in contrast to the standard QAH phase in checkerboard lattice, which preserves all lattice symmetries. Additionally, we find an enhanced bond-nematic Dirac semimetallic (BNDS) phase due to asymmetric hopping, which is thought to be absent in the Hartree-Fock approach. In the parameter regimes where QBT splits into two Dirac nodes, the QAH phase survives up to a finite staggered on-site potential. However, as the staggered potential increases, the QAH phase is suppressed while the BNDS phase grows stronger.</description>

      <title>Strain-control of electronic superlattice domains in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metals AV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) provide a unique platform to investigate the physics of interacting electrons, a central challenge in condensed matter physics. A key obstacle in unraveling their correlated behavior is to determine which structural and electronic degrees of freedom are involved and how they couple. Here we address this important issue with a novel approach, namely by exploring the strain dependence of electronic superlattices in CsV$_{3}$Sb$_{5}$. Using high-resolution x-ray diffraction, we track the detwinning of the $2\times 2\times 4$ electronic crystal and uncover a gigantic strain response of its domains. We further show that the detwinned $2\times 2\times 4$ phase exhibits an intrinsic 2$\textbf{q}$-modulation and strong mode coupling. Density functional theory reveals that the structural $2\times 2\times 4$ modulation couples strongly to the V $3d$-orbitals, naturally explaining its pronounced strain response. In contrast, the $2\times 2\times 2$ phase at lower temperatures remains essentially unaffected by small uniaxial strain. This dichotomy points to fundamental differences in the symmetry breaking and stabilization mechanisms of the two electronic orders. More specifically, our results provide evidence for the active role of orbital degrees of freedom, which can realize distinct, complex ordering patterns driven by competing interactions.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnetic properties of MnF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry informed diffraction patterns for magnetically ordered MnF2 illuminated by x-rays tuned in energy to a Mn atomic resonance depend on circular polarization in the primary beam. The change in intensity of a Bragg spot with a change in handedness defines a chiral signature for the compensated antiferromagnet that is calculated for electric dipole (E1) and electric quadrupole (E2) absorption events. E1-E2 absorption events are forbidden by inversion symmetry in Wyckoff positions assigned to Mn ions in the established MnF2 magnetic symmetry. Spin-flip signals from the magnetic scattering of polarized neutrons depend on electronic quadrupole and octupole moments that are zero for the nominal 3d5 configuration of Mn2+, which make them good tests of the actual electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and 3D Hopping Conduction at the Surface of FeSb2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of metallic surface states in the d-electron Kondo insulator candidates FeSi and FeSb2, along with some recent reports of magnetic correlations in the surface transport properties of FeSi, we have investigated the low temperature surface magnetotransport properties of FeSb2. By using a Corbino disk transport geometry, we were able to isolate the electrical transport properties of a single surface of our samples and study the [110] and [101] naturally forming faces separately. Studying the relationship between the applied magnetic field, current direction and crystal symmetry has allowed us to separate possible contributions to the magnetotransport anisotropy. Unlike previous studies of SmB6 surface states, we find no two-dimensional Drude-like dependence on field orientation relative to current direction, but instead a magnetocrystalline anisotropy that appears to originate from local moment scattering with a well defined easy-axis along the [100] direction. We compare these results with the magnetotransport properties of the conducting surface states on the [111] facet of FeSi. We also find evidence of 3D variable-range hopping conduction below the bulk-to-surface crossover, extending below 1 K, which implies that the electrical transport at the surface of these materials is carried by a thin, but 3D conducting channel, which is inconsistent with the lower dimensional states expected for a strong topological insulator.</description>

      <title>Self-learning QMC: application to the classical Holstein-Spin-Fermion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in systems with competing interactions, we developed a self-learning quantum Monte Carlo (SLQMC) method to simulate the phase transition in the classical Holstein-spin-fermion model. In SLQMC, machine learning techniques are employed to approximate the free energy, thereby bypassing the need for exact diagonalization and significantly reducing computational cost. We assess the performance of SLQMC using both linear regression and neural network models. Our results show that both models are capable of capturing the phase transition from the antiferromagnetic state to the charge-density-wave state. However, the sampling efficiency decreases near the AFM-CDW phase transition, which is attributed to the increased mean-squared-error of the machine learning model. Additionally, the sampling efficiency decreases with increasing lattice size. This suppression is due to the increased root-mean-squared-error as the machine learning model is applied to a large lattice and the finite-size effect, wherein the energy gap between the ground state and low-energy excited states decreases as the lattice grows. Our findings highlight the necessity of highly accurate machine learning models to simulate theoretical models with complex, competing microscopic interactions on a large lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that strongly bound excitons, whose radii approach the lattice constant, display physics that eludes continuum descriptions not just quantitatively but qualitatively. We investigate such phenomenology by calculating the exciton spectra for several one- and two-dimensional lattice models, whose valence band has a multi-orbital character. We identify sharp transitions in the character and momentum of the lowest-energy exciton driven directly by the multi-orbital nature of the lattice models. Such transitions cannot occur in simple continuum descriptions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-required Orbital Selectivity in Monolayer FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital-selective correlations have been observed to play an important role in Fe-based superconductors. Here, in contrast to previous site-local Mott transition-based origins, we present a band-theory-based mechanism for orbital-selective physics in monolayer FeSe, for which only electron pockets appear. Underlying our mechanism is our density functional theory (DFT)-based observation that, for the electron pockets, antiferromagnetic fluctuations are strongly coupled to electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals but weakly coupled to those in $\{xz,yz\}$ orbitals. Symmetry-arguments reveal that this orbital selective coupling originates from the different intertwined orbital and Fe-site sublattice Bloch wavefunctions for these two sets of orbitals, specifically, the $x^2-y^2$ orbitals can be Fe-site localized. The strong coupling of electrons in $x^2-y^2$ orbitals to the magnetic fluctuations enables orbital-selective electronic renormalizations that can account for important features of our angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. Our symmetry-required mechanism for orbital selective physics can be generalized to a range of crystal space groups with four-fold and six-fold screw axes.</description>

      <title>Site Basis Excitation Ansatz for Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient variation of the tangent-space excitation ansatz used to compute elementary excitation spectra of one-dimensional quantum lattice systems using matrix product states (MPS). A small basis for the excitation tensors is formed based on a single diagonalization analogous to a single site DMRG step but for multiple states. Once overlap and Hamiltonian matrix elements are found, obtaining the excitation for any momentum only requires diagonalization of a tiny matrix, akin to a non-orthogonal band-theory diagonalization. The approach is based on an infinite MPS description of the ground state, and we introduce an extremely simple alternative to variational uniform matrix product states (VUMPS) based on finite system DMRG. For the $S=1$ Heisenberg chain, our method -- site basis excitation ansatz (SBEA) -- efficiently produces the one-magnon dispersion with high accuracy. We also examine the role of MPS gauge choices, finding that not imposing a gauge condition -- leaving the basis nonorthogonal -- is crucial for the approach, whereas imposing a left-orthonormal gauge (as in prior work) severely hampers convergence. We also show how one can construct Wannier excitations, analogous to the Wannier functions of band theory, where one Wannier excitation, translated to all sites, can reconstruct the single magnon modes exactly for all momenta.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the composite fermion theory for fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generalized composite fermion (CF) theory for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) by adapting the quantum mechanics approach of CFs. The theoretical framework naturally produces an effective CF Hamiltonian and a wavefunction ansatz, and the Bloch band characteristics of FCIs determine effective scalar and vector potentials experienced by CFs. Our analysis clarifies the construction of CF wavefunctions and state counting in CF phase space, which is subject to a density-of-states correction for filling factors $|\nu| \neq 1/2$. We apply the theory to study the $\nu=-2/3$ FCI state of the twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ system, modeling it as either a $1/3$-filled electron band or a $2/3$-filled hole band. While both CF models exhibit trends and features consistent with exact diagonalization results, the electron-based model shows better agreement. Furthermore, we find that the FCI phase transition coincides with a topological phase transition in unoccupied CF $\Lambda$-bands.</description>

      <title>Absence of high-field spin supersolid phase in Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetization, torque magnetometry, specific heat and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are used to study the high field intermediate phase between the 1/3-magnetization plateau and polarized state in the quantum Ising antiferromagnet Rb$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ with a triangular lattice. The magnetic phase diagram with the magnetic field up to 30 T is mapped by the comprehensive experimental data. The "up-up-down" (UUD) spin configuration of the 1/3-magnetization plateau state is identified by NMR spectral analysis. At higher magnetic fields, this UUD structure persist to the intermediate phase, which is finally destroyed in the polarized state. This observation supplies unambiguous spectroscopic evidence for the absence of proposed high field spin supersolid phase. The high-field phase diagram of this quantum magnet proximate to the Ising-anisotropy limit contradicts with that proposed by theoretical studies.</description>

      <title>Confinement, deconfinement, and bound states in the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ generalizations of the Majumdar--Ghosh chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of low-energy excitations in a spin chain with antiferrmomagnetic nearest-neighbor $J_1$, next-nearest-neighbor $J_2$, and three-site $J_3$ interactions using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group and the single mode approximation techniques. In the absence of the $J_2$ interaction, we identify clear distinctions in the spectral functions in the fully dimerized phase across the exactly dimerized line for different magnitudes of the spins. In contrast to the spin-$1/2$ chain, where the spinon continuum dominates the spectral functions, the magnon modes are prominent in the spectral functions of the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ chains. Through single mode approximation and valence bond solid approaches, we disentangle magnon and spinon contributions to the spectral functions. After including the $J_2$ interactions, for the spin-$1$ chain we trace the evolution of the dynamical structure factor along the phase transition line between the Haldane phase and the fully dimerized phase. We find that the excitation spectrum is a continuum along this line and the spectral gap closes as the order of the transition changes from first order to second order. Along the line of first-order transitions, the spinon-like domain walls are deconfined, and the model exhibits their confinement into discrete bound states away from the transition line. A similar phenomenon occurs in the spin-$3/2$ chain across the phase transition between partially dimerized to fully dimerized phases, revealing a universal spinon confinement phenomenon across first-order phase transitions. This study presents the dynamical structure factor corresponding to the ground state phase diagram and establishes a unified quasiparticle framework for understanding the fundamental nature of excitations across distinct quantum phases in frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg spin chains.</description>

      <title>Trigonal distortion in the Kitaev candidate honeycomb magnet BaCo2(AsO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted x-ray absorption (XAS) and magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements at the Co $L_{2,3}$ edges on single crystals of the Kitaev candidate honeycomb lattice compound BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. The measurements employed the inverse partial fluorescence yield technique, which is ideal for acquiring reliable x-ray absorption spectra from highly insulating samples, enabling precise quantitative analysis. Our experimental results revealed a significant linear dichroic signal, indicating strong trigonal distortion in the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra in BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$. We performed a detailed analysis of the experimental XAS and XMCD spectra using a full-multiplet configuration-interaction cluster model. This analysis unveiled that the $t_{2g}$ hole density is predominantly localized in the $a_{1g}$ orbital. Through XMCD sum rules and theoretical calculations, we quantified both the spin and orbital magnetic moments. Our study demonstrates that the local electronic structure of the CoO$_{6}$ octahedra displays an effective trigonal distortion of approximately $-0.114$ eV. This distortion is larger than the Co $3d$ spin-orbit coupling constant, emphasizing the crucial impact of local structural distortions on the electronic and magnetic properties of BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in biaxial-strain detwinned $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The honeycomb magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ has been a leading candidate for realizing the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL), but its intrinsic spin dynamics have remained obscured by crystal twinning. Here we apply biaxial anisotropic strain to detwin $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$ single crystals and directly visualize the intrinsic magnetic excitations using inelastic neutron scattering. We discover that the low-energy spin waves emerge from the $M$ points -- transverse to the magnetic Bragg peaks -- providing direct evidence of anisotropic magnetic interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$. The intrinsic spin-wave spectrum imposes stringent constraints on the extended Kitaev Hamiltonian, yielding a refined, quantitatively consistent set of exchange couplings for the zigzag ground state and its low-energy dynamics. Above the magnon band, we uncover broad excitation continua: while a twofold-symmetric feature near 6 meV at $\Gamma$ is consistent with bimagnon scattering, the dominant spectral weight forms a sixfold-symmetric continuum extending up to $\sim 16$ meV that cannot be explained by conventional magnons. This strongly supports the presence of fractionalized excitations-a hallmark of Kitaev QSL physics. Our findings establish biaxial strain as a powerful symmetry-breaking probe to access the intrinsic spin dynamics of Kitaev materials and provide critical benchmarks for refining theoretical models of quantum magnetism in $\alpha$-RuCl$_{3}$.</description>

      <title>Towards effective models for low-dimensional cuprates: From ground state Hamiltonian reconstruction to spectral functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding which minimal effective model captures the essential physics of cuprates is a key step towards unraveling the mechanism behind high-$T_c$ superconductivity. Recent measurements of the dynamical spin structure factor (DSF) in cuprate ladder compounds have indicated the presence of a large effective attraction in the single-band Hubbard model, possibly mediated by phonons. Here, we demonstrate that similar DSF features can also be captured by $t$-$J$ descriptions with or even without any attractive term. Motivated by this observation, we systematically investigate the strength and origin of different contributions to the single-band Hamiltonians by downfolding either from the three-band Emery model or the electron-phonon coupled Hubbard-Holstein model. For one-dimensional systems, we find that the extended versions of both single-band descriptions can reproduce the experimentally observed DSF signatures. Finally, we extend our analysis to two dimensions by comparing two-hole correlation functions for the different single-band models. Our results provide new insights into the long-standing question of which single-band Hamiltonian can capture the essential physics of cuprates.</description>

      <title>Wilson-Loop-Ideal Bands and General Idealization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum geometry is universally bounded from below by Wilson-loop windings. In this work, we define an isolated set of bands to be Wilson-loop-ideal, if their quantum metric saturates the Wilson-loop lower bound. The definition naturally incorporates the known Chern-ideal and Euler-ideal bands, and allows us to define other types of ideal bands, such as Kane-Mele $Z_2$-ideal bands. In particular, we find that an isolated set of two $Z_2$-ideal bands with non-singular nonabelian Berry curvature always admits a Chern-ideal gauge (i.e., effectively behaving as two decoupled Chern-ideal bands), even in the absence of any global good quantum number (such as spin). This enables the direct construction of fractional topological insulator wavefunctions. We further propose a general framework of constructing monotonic flows that achieve Wilson-loop-ideal states starting from non-ideal bands through band mixing, where Wilson-loop-ideal states are not energy eigenstates but have smooth projectors similar to isolated bands. We apply the constructed flows to the realistic model of $3.89^\circ$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and a moir\'e Rashba model, and numerically find Chern-ideal and $Z_2$-ideal states, respectively, with relative error in the integrated quantum metric below $5\times 10^{-3}$. Our general definition of Wilson-loop-ideal bands and general procedure of constructing Wilson-loop-ideal states provide a solid basis for future study of novel correlated physics.</description>

      <title>A folded string dual for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a folded string moving in rigid AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared as a dual of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model at its conformal fixed point. In standard AdS$_2$, the string is represented by two massless particles connected by straight string segments. The particles move at the speed of light, abruptly reversing direction at turning points. We describe the system using the lightcone coordinates of these points, with the Poisson structure obtained from the Peierls bracket. In AdS$_2$ with imaginary radius squared, quantization of the string's mass-squared in momentum-fraction space yields a P\"oschl-Teller equation, reproducing the SYK operator spectrum.</description>

      <title>Extended Hubbard Model realized in 2D clusters of molecular anions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubbard model, despite its simplicity, is remarkably successful at describing numerous many-body phenomena. However, due to the small class of problems which can be solved exactly, there has been substantial interest in quantum simulations of extended Hubbard models to in turn, simulate materials and the interaction-driven phases they host. Here, we study small clusters of molecular anions of 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride on NaCl bilayers on Ag(111) using non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy, Electrostatic Force Spectroscopy, and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy and Spectroscopy, and show that the occupation and transition energies are well described by an extended Hubbard model. In particular, asymmetric clusters of four molecules require the addition of differing inter-site electrostatic interaction terms and on-site potentials, as well as asymmetric hoping terms. With $t&lt;&lt;U$, occupation asymmetry is driven by these terms, independent of U. The good agreement between the model and the data indicate such molecular anion clusters could be used to probe larger systems and a more varied phase space of realistic fermionic Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Topological Dice Flat Band in Yttrium Monochloride Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent experiment [arXiv:2508.21311] the long-sought dice lattice and its characteristic flat band has been discovered for the first time in the two-dimensional layered electride yttrium monochloride (YCl), in which the interstitial anionic electrons of the electride self-organize into a dice lattice geometry. In this Letter, combining symmetry analysis, relativistic density-functional theory and realistic tight-binding model calculations, we predict that the dice flat band in YCl is intrinsically topological and characterized by a high Chern number of $\mathcal{C} = \pm 4$. In particular, the intrinsic atomic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from $4d$-electrons of yttrium atoms creates topological gaps on the scale of 20 meV near $\pm K$ and leads to the emergence of nontrivial Berry curvatures and band topology. Displacement fields applied across the layered electride architecture can easily drive topological phase transitions. Our findings establish the newly discovered YCl electride as the first natural material hosting a dice flat Chern band without any extrinsic band engineering.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Thermalization dynamics of finite-size quantum critical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using holographic duality, we investigate thermalization process when two finite-size quantum critical systems are brought into thermal contact along a perfectly transmitting interface. Through real-time simulations of gravitational dynamics, which are spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic and are confined within two dynamical bulk branes, we identify three distinct thermalization patterns governed by the energy imbalance (temperature difference) and system size. For systems with large size and small energy imbalance, we observe recurrent cycles of formation and collapse of non-equilibrium steady states (NESS). Under large energy imbalance, shock waves persist for a prolonged period with sustained boundary reflections, while rarefaction waves rapidly homogenize. When the system size is sufficiently small, dissipation dominates and leads to oscillatory decay without sustained NESS or shock structure. In sharp contrast to diffusive systems, we uncover that wave-propagated energy transfer together with boundary reflections enables nearly complete energy swapping between subsystems during thermalization. Our results reveal rich thermalization dynamics in finite-size quantum critical systems across spatial scales and energy gradient regimes.</description>

      <title>Silicon-Compatible Ionic Control over Multi-State Magnetoelectric Phase Transformations in Correlated Oxide System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing room-temperature ferromagnetic insulators, critical enablers for low-power spintronics, is fundamentally challenged by the long-standing trade-off between ferromagnetic ordering and indirect exchange interactions in insulators. Ionic evolution offers tempting opportunities for accessing exotic magnetoelectric states and physical functionality beyond conventional doping paradigm via tailoring the charge-lattice-orbital-spin interactions. Here, we showcase the precise magneto-ionic control over magnetoelectric states in LSMO system, delicately delivering silicon-compatible weakly ferromagnetic insulator state above room temperature. Of particular note is the decoupling of ion-charge-spin interplay in correlated LSMO system, a primary obstacle in clarifying underlying physical origin, with this process concurrently giving rise to an emergent intermediate state characterized by a weakly ferromagnetic half-metallic state. Benefiting from the SrTiO3 buffer layer as epitaxial template to promote interfacial heterogeneous nucleation, hydrogenation enables diverse magnetoelectric states in LSMO integrated on silicon, fully compatible with traditional semiconductor processing. Assisted by theoretical calculations and spectroscopic techniques, hydrogen-induced magnetoelectric transitions in LSMO are driven by band-filling control and suppression in double exchange interaction. Our work not only defines a novel design paradigm for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated system, with transformative potential for spintronics, but also fundamentally unveils the physical origin behind ionic evolution via disentangling the ion-charge-spin coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate high-energy spin excitations in hole-doped La$_{2-x}$Ca$_{x}$CuO$_{4-\delta}$ films across a broad Ca doping range $x = 0.05-0.50$ using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Polarization analysis and incident-photon energy detuning measurements confirm the persistence of collective paramagnon excitations up to $x = 0.50$. Consistent with previous studies on other cuprate families, we observe a pronounced crossover near $x = 0.15$, where paramagnon spectral weight is transferred to incoherent spin-flip excitations associated with the particle-hole continuum. The overall behavior of paramagnons in LCCO resembles that in other hole-doped cuprates and appears insensitive to the persistence of superconductivity at high doping levels in LCCO - up to at least $x = 0.50$, as demonstrated in prior work. These findings support the view that high-energy magnetic excitations probed by RIXS are not a major contributor to superconducting pairing, in line with theories of spin-fluctuation mediated superconductivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light offers a route to engineer new phases of matter far from equilibrium, including transient states suggestive of superconducting, charge-ordered, and excitonic ordering behavior. Yet it remains unclear how optical excitation can dynamically produce long-range phase coherence-a defining feature of true order such as superconductivity-rather than merely enhancing local pairing. Here we show that impulsively driven low-frequency phonons enhance long-range electronic correlations in a low-dimensional metal. Through numerically exact simulations, we demonstrate that slow phonons suppress dynamical disorder, enabling buildup of coherence and enhancement of charge (and pairing) orders. These findings provide direct evidence that light can mediate enhancement of long-range order and suggest that future experimental strategies-such as the design of selective excitations of narrow phonon distributions to limit dephasing-may offer viable routes to design and stabilize transient superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Radiative Higgs mode in photoinduced $\eta$ pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega&gt;\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from parameter regimes dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably, the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional spin helix and magnon-induced singularity in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14065v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene exhibits prominent correlated phenomena in two distinct regimes: a Kondo lattice near the magic angle, resembling heavy fermion systems, and a triangular correlated domain wall network under interlayer bias, akin to sliding Luttinger liquids previously introduced for cuprates. Combining these characteristics, here we investigate a system where interacting electrons in the domain wall network couple to localized spins. Owing to inter-domain-wall correlations, a quasi-two-dimensional spin helix phase within the localized spins emerges as a result of spatial phase coherence across parallel domain walls. Within the spin helix phase, magnons can induce a singularity, reflected in the scaling exponents of various correlation functions, accessible through electrical means and by adjusting the twist angle. We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic paramagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced singularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the Kondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids. Integrating critical aspects of Luttinger liquid physics, magnetism, and Kondo physics in twisted bilayer graphene, our findings offer insights into similar correlated phenomena across a broad range of twisted van der Waals structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</description>

Abstract: We investigated magnetization, muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), and $^{119}Sn$ M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy on Sn substituted $CuCr_{2-x}Sn_xS_4$ (x=0.03 and 0.08) spinel compounds. The magnetization and $\mu$SR results reveal similar additional low-temperature magnetic transitions around 80 K and 40 K as found for the undoped material, indicating a magnetic ground state deviating from a simple collinear ferromagnet. The observed changes in the M\"{o}ssbauer hyperfine spectra are less pronounced and are discussed in view of the different positions of the local probes $\mu^+$ and $^{119}Sn$ and their different magnetic coupling to the magnetic Cr lattice. Above 80 K, both $\mu$SR and M\"{o}ssbauer spectra show temperature-dependent inhomogeneous broadening either due to structural or charge disorder and changing spin dynamics that can be related to a precursor magnetic phase above the well-defined static low-temperature phase.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the Kitaev model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator RuCl3. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review begins with a brief review on QSLs in other systems, followed by a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on RuCl3. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</description>

      <title>Selective Kondo screening and strange metallicity by sliding Dirac semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kondo screening of local moments in normal metals typically leads to hybridized conduction and valence bands separated by a Kondo gap, resulting in an insulating state at half-band filling. We show a dramatic change of this scenario in a Dirac-semimetal-based correlated system -- a bilayer honeycomb lattice heterostructure where the local moment lattice is stacked on a Dirac semimetal breaking the inversion symmetry. This system is modeled by an extended Anderson honeycomb lattice involving the real-space dependence of major interlayer hybridization parameters on the relative sliding distance along the armchair direction. First, we unveil the multiple Kondo scales and the successive Kondo breakdown transitions in this correlated heterostructure under sliding. Second, we demonstrate the existence of a genuine selective Kondo screening phase which is stabilized near the A-B stack pattern and is accessible by applying the interlayer voltage. Third, we find a nearly flat hybridized band located concomitantly within the Kondo gap, resulting in an unprecedented metallic state at the half-band filling. This unconventional heavy fermion state is characterized by the violation of Luttinger theorem and the appearance of a Van Hove singularity at the Fermi energy. The general sliding-driven band structure landscape and the implications of our results for the broad context of multiorbital Kondo physics are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal</title>

Abstract: We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of polarized electronic Raman response in trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, uncovering a systematic reduction of the incoherent electron continuum across the density wave transition in the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ representations. Analysis based on the Fermi surface band curvatures points to quasiparticle coherence in momentum positions with dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character. Our findings establish the symmetry channels and the active role of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals involved in the density wave formation, offering important insight into the electronic and magnetic correlations in the nickelate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments.</description>

Abstract: We derive the coupled-cluster doubles (CCD) amplitude equations by introduction of the particle-hole-time decoupled electronic self-energy. The resulting analysis leads to an expression for the ground state correlation energy that is exactly of the form obtained in coupled-cluster doubles theory. We demonstrate the relationship to the ionization potential/electron affinity equation-of-motion coupled-cluster doubles (IP/EA-EOM-CCD) eigenvalue problem by coupling the reverse-time self-energy contributions while maintaining particle-hole separability. The formal relationships established are demonstrated by exact solution of the Hubbard dimer.</description>

      <title>Unfolding the kagome lattice to improve understanding of ARPES in CoSn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic kagome lattices are attracting significant attention as they provide a platform to explore the interplay between topology and magnetism. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) plays a key role in unraveling their electronic structure. However, the analysis is often challenging due to the presence of multiple bands near the Fermi level. Indeed, each orbital generates three bands in a kagome lattice due to its three sites motif, which soon becomes complicated if many orbitals are present. To address this complexity, using ARPES matrix elements can be highly beneficial. First, band symmetry can be determined through selection rules based on light polarization. We emphasize that, in kagome lattices, as in all multi-site lattices, symmetry of the Bloch state is not only determined by the orbital character but also by the relative phase between the three sublattices. Additionally, interference between the three sublattices leads to a strong modulation of ARPES intensity across neighboring Brillouin zones. We show how unfolded band calculations capture these modulations, helping with band identification. We apply these ideas to CoSn, whose simple structure retains the key features of a kagome lattice. Using polarization dependent ARPES in several Brillouin zones, we isolate the dispersion of each band and discuss novel correlation effects, selectively renormalizing the bands crossing the Fermi level and shifting the others.</description>

      <title>Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum liquids and the cuprate high temperature superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for the cuprate superconductors, rooted in a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) description of the intermediate-temperature pseudogap phase at low doping. The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of fractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a spin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport observation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.
  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer construction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the gapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone. Fluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin liquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2) gauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One route to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave superconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices surrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a charge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement with experiments.
  Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a Fermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal regime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge' liquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the regimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum phase transitions in disordered metals.</description>

Abstract: Recent experiments have reported the surprising observation of superconductivity in flavor polarized, nearly flat bands (FBs) of rhombohedral graphene. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for single-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive interaction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact superconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to realistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main effect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly attractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The nature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum geometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is so. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes, whose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap between the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular momentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different topology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the attractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational upper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the maximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry in the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.</description>

      <title>Note on searching for critical lattice models as entropy critical points from strange correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An entropy function is proposed in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 251602] as a way to detect criticality even when the system size is small. In this note we apply this strategy in the search for criticality of lattice transfer matrices constructed based on the topological holographic principle. We find that the combination of strategy is indeed a cost-effective and efficient way of identifying critical boundary conditions, estimating central charges and moreover, plotting entire phase diagrams in a multi-dimensional phase space.</description>

      <title>Neural network-based nodal structures optimization for interacting fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Tunability of the magnetic properties in Ni intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the magnetic and electronic properties of Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$.We calculate the magnetic exchanges of Ni$_x$NbSe$_2$ ($x = 1/3, 1/4,$ and $1$) and find that the out-of-plane magnetic coupling depends on the Ni connectivity: it is ferromagnetic when Ni atoms stack on top of each other, and antiferromagnetic otherwise. Focusing on Ni$_{0.25}$NbSe$_2$, we identify a ground-state transition from a stripe antiferromagnetic phase with Kramers degeneracy to a ferromagnetic phase above a critical Coulomb interaction U$_C$. Spin--orbit coupling lowers U$_C$, aligns the easy axis along $z$, and stabilizes collinear AFM and FM states over the competing 120$^\circ$ phase. Ni intercalation also strongly modifies the electronic structure, replacing the $\Gamma$-point hole pocket of pristine NbSe$_2$ with an electron pocket and shifting the Van Hove singularity away from the Fermi level, thereby suppressing potential instabilities. Finally, we investigate the altermagnetic phase in the broader class T$_{0.25}$MX$_2$, finding that spin--orbit effects induce orbital antiferromagnetism with weak ferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the N\'eel vector orientation. Our results demonstrate that Ni-intercalated NbSe$_2$ provides a versatile platform to explore and tune multiple competing magnetic phases that lie close in energy.</description>

      <title>Fast offline decoding with local message-passing automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a local offline decoder for topological codes that operates according to a parallelized message-passing framework. The decoder works by passing messages between anyons, with the contents of received messages used to move nearby anyons towards one another. We prove the existence of a threshold, and show that in a system of linear size $L$, decoding terminates with an $O((\log L)^\eta)$ average-case runtime, where $\eta$ is a small constant. For the toric code subject to i.i.d Pauli noise, our decoder has $\eta=1$ and a threshold at a noise strength of $p_c\approx 7.3\%$.</description>

      <title>Strongly Correlated Transport in Topological Y-Junction Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I analyze electron transport through a Y-junction formed by helical edge states of a two-dimensional topological insulator (2DTI), focusing on the strongly interacting regime. An experimentally motivated device geometry and a spin-conserving tunneling Hamiltonian are proposed. I compute the conductance tensor and show that, for specific tunneling phases and strong repulsive interactions ($g&lt;1/2$), transport is governed by an intermediate renormalization group fixed point that interpolates between the weak- and strong-tunneling limits. These results extend previous studies of point-contact tunneling and demonstrate how interactions qualitatively modify the transport properties of multiterminal topological devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Superfluid Density in Pair-Density-Wave Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair-density-wave (PDW) states -- exotic superconductors with spatially modulated order -- are a long-sought-after phase of quantum materials, with the potential to unravel the mysteries of high-$T_c$ cuprates and other strongly correlated superconductors. Yet, surprisingly, a key signature of stable superconductivity, namely the positivity of the superfluid density, $n_s(T)$, has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we address this central issue by calculating $n_s(T)$, for a generic model two-dimensional PDW superconductor. We uncover a surprisingly large region of intrinsic instability, associated with negative $n_s(T)$, revealing that a significant portion of the parameter space thought to be physical cannot support superconducting order. This instability is driven by the large pairing momentum required to form the PDW state. In the remaining stable regime, we predict two striking and observable fingerprints: an anomalously small longitudinal superfluid response that is vulnerable to thermal fluctuations, and an unusual temperature dependence for $n_s(T)$ arising from the unique gapless excitation spectrum of the PDW state. These generally model independent, as well as experimentally relevant findings suggest that the fragility of the superfluid density poses a significant problem for the formation of stable, finite temperature PDW superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Fermion Interactions in BCS Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>
