      <title>Time evaluation of portfolio for asymmetrically informed traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anticipating version of the classical portfolio optimization problem in a financial market with the presence of a trader who possesses privileged information about the future (insider information), but who is also subjected to a delay in the information flow about the market conditions; hence this trader possesses an asymmetric information with respect to the traditional one. We analyze it via the Russo-Vallois forward stochastic integral, i. e. using anticipating stochastic calculus, along with a white noise approach. We explicitly compute the optimal portfolios that maximize the expected logarithmic utility assuming different classical financial models: Black-Scholes-Merton, Heston, Vasicek. Similar results hold for other well-known models, such as the Hull-White and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross ones. Our comparison between the performance of the traditional trader and the insider, although only asymmetrically informed, reveals that the privileged information overcompensates the delay in all cases, provided only one information flow is delayed. However, when two information flows are delayed, a competition between future information and delay magnitude enters into play, implying that the best performance depends on the parameter values. This, in turn, allows us to value future information in terms of time, and not only utility.</description>

      <title>Long time behavior of semi-Markov modulated perpetuity and some related processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>

      <title>Relative Arbitrage Opportunities in an Extended Mean Field System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies relative arbitrage opportunities in a market with infinitely many interacting investors. We establish a conditional McKean-Vlasov system to study the market dynamics coupled with investors. We then provide a theoretical framework to study a mean-field system, where the mean-field terms consist of a joint distribution of wealth and strategies. The optimal relative arbitrage is characterized by the equilibrium of extended mean-field games. We show the conditions on the existence and the uniqueness of the mean field equilibrium, then prove the propagation of chaos results for the finite-player game, and demonstrate that the Nash equilibrium converges to the mean field equilibrium when the population grows to infinity.</description>

      <title>Non--regular McKean--Vlasov equations and calibration problem in local stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to deal with the question of the existence of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model in finance, we investigate a class of McKean--Vlasov equations where a minimal continuity assumption is imposed on the coefficients. Namely, the drift coefficient and, in particular, the volatility coefficient are not necessarily continuous in the measure variable for the Wasserstein topology. In this paper, we provide an existence result and show an approximation by $N$--particle system or propagation of chaos for this type of McKean--Vlasov equations. As a direct result, we are able to deduce the existence of a calibrated local stochastic volatility model for an appropriate choice of stochastic volatility parameters. The associated propagation of chaos result is also proved.</description>

      <title>Robust convex risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the general properties of robust convex risk measures as they relate to worst-case values under uncertainty in random variables. We establish general concrete results regarding convex conjugates and sub-differentials. We refine results for closed forms of worst-case law-invariant convex risk measures under two specific uncertainty sets: one based on the first two moments and another on Wasserstein balls.</description>
