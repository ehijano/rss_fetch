      <title>Quantum Mpemba effects in many-body localization systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems have attracted growing attention due to various intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. One famous example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where the subsystem symmetry is restored faster under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. The quantum Mpemba effect has been extensively studied in integrable and chaotic systems. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems with various initial states. We reveal that the symmetry can still be fully restored in many-body localization phases without approaching thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect is universal for any initial tilted product state, contrasting to the cases in the chaotic systems where the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect relies on the choice of initial states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effects with the help of the effective model for many-body localization. This Letter not only sheds light on extending the quantum Mpemba effect to more non-equilibrium settings but also contributes to a deeper understanding of the many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Computation of Biological Conductance with Liouville Quantum Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that single proteins can display high conductivity, which stays finite for low temperatures, decays slowly with distance, and exhibits a rich spatial structure featuring highly conducting and strongly insulating domains. Here, we intruduce a new formula by combining the density matrix of the Liouville-Master Equation simulating quantum transport in nanoscale devices, and the phenomenological model of electronic conductance through molecules, that can account for the observed distance- and temperature dependence of conductance in proteins. We demonstrate its efficacy on experimentally highly conductive extracellular cytochrome nanowires, which are good candidates to illustrate our new approach by calculating and visualizing their electronic wiring, given the interest in the arrangement of their conducting and insulating parts. As proteins and protein nanowires exhibit significant potential for diverse applications, including energy production and sensing, our computational technique can accelerate the design of nano-bioelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Are crumpled sheets marginally stable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study networks of coupled bistable elastic elements, recently proposed as a model for crumpled thin sheets. The networks are poised on the verge of a localized instability, and the model allows unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. The networks also host quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes, and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds which are locally unstable. Our model combines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation, providing novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Structural Diversity in Condensed Matter: A General Characterization of Crystals, Amorphous Solids and the Structures Between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A definition of structural diversity, adapted from the biodiversity literature, is introduced to provide a general characterization of structures of condensed matter. Using the Favored Local Structure (FLS) lattice model as a testbed, the diversity measure is found to effectively filter extrinsic noise and to provide a useful differentiation between crystal and amorphous structures. We identify an interesting class of structures intermediate between crystals and glasses that are characterised by a complex combination of short-range ordering and long-range disorder. We demonstrate how the diversity can be used as an order parameter to organise various scenarios by structure change in response to increasing diversity.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Application of the Two-Electron Quantum Theory of Glass States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The glass state problem stems from the failure described in terms of one-electron theory or atoms (molecules) as independent particles. In 2005, de Gennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms was to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing glass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules (HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we discovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of de Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis is the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum states of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27% to form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron orbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic interface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval of 5.9987{\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs. This is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron pairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective behavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition and the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a complete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new interpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which provides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Neural ODEs for holographic transport models without translation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the data-driven holographic transport models without translation symmetry, focusing on the real part of frequency-dependent shear viscosity, $\eta_{\mathrm{re}}(\omega)$. We develop a radial flow equation of the shear response and establish its relation to $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega)$ for a wide class of holographic models. This allows us to determine $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ of a strongly coupled field theory by the black hole metric and the graviton mass. The latter serves as the bulk dual to the translation symmetry breaking on the boundary. We convert the flow equation to a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), which is a neural network with continuous depth and produces output through a black-box ODE solver. Testing the Neural ODE on three well-known holographic models without translation symmetry, we demonstrate its ability to accurately learn either the metric or mass when given the other. Additionally, we illustrate that the learned metric can be used to predict the derivative of entanglement entropy $S$ with respect to the size of entangling region $l$.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations in Elastic Moduli and Local Stresses at the Unjamming Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli as well as the correlations between local moduli in model solids with short-range repulsive potentials. We show through numerical simulations that local elastic moduli exhibit long-range correlations, similar to correlations in the local stresses. Specifically, the correlations in local shear moduli exhibit anisotropic behavior at large lengthscales characterized by pinch-point singularities in Fourier space, displaying a structural pattern akin to shear stress correlations. Focussing on two-dimensional jammed solids approaching the unjamming transition, we show that stress correlations exhibit universal properties, characterized by a quadratic $p^2$ dependence of the correlations as the pressure $p$ approaches zero, independent of the details of the model. In contrast, the modulus correlations exhibit a power-law dependence with different exponents depending on the specific interaction potential. Furthermore, we illustrate that while affine responses lack long-range correlations, the total modulus, which encompasses non-affine behavior, exhibits long-range correlations.</description>
