      <title>On one filtration of holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider a family of function classes constructed by means of the Gauss hypergeometric function $_2F_1(1,1;2;z) =-\frac{\log(1-z)}{z}$. We demonstrate that this family, in fact, constitutes classes of analytic functions subject to prescribed constraints on their derivatives. For these classes we obtain some geometric characteristics, including sharp coefficient estimates. Moreover, we show that this family naturally provides a filtration of infinitesimal generators, and investigate the corresponding dynamical behavior of the associated semigroups. It is interesting that this filtration links to the Ma--Minda starlike functions.</description>

      <title>Some results related to Macaulay's Theorem about Hilbert functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I$ be a homogeneous ideal in the polynomial ring $R = k[z_1, \cdots, z_n]$ , where $k$ is an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Macaulay's Theorem provides constraints on the Hilbert function of $I$ or $R/I$ from one degree to the next.
  Nowadays, the standard quotation of Macaulay's theorem is $H_{R/I}(d + 1) \le H_{R/I}(d)^{\langle d\rangle}$, which is regarding the quotient $R/I$ and the combinatorial computation in the formula involves the number $d$ explicitly. However, the origin statement of Macaulay is in fact regarding the Hilbert function of $I$ itself and the relevant combinatorics explicitly involves the number of variables (i.e. $n$) and does not depend on $d$.
  In this paper, we provide an elementary proof of the equivalence between these two versions of Macaulay's theorem. The original degree-independent version is more suitable for problems such as those involving sums of polynomial squared norms.
  Motivated by the Hermitian analogue of Hilbert's 17th problem and proper holomorphic mappings between complex unit balls, some questions lead to the study of Hermitian polynomials $M(z, \bar{z}) \in \mathbb{C}[z_1, \ldots, z_n, \bar{z}_1, \ldots, \bar{z}_n]$ satisfying $M(z, \bar{z})\|z\|^{2l} = \|h\|^2$ for some $l$ and a holomorphic mapping $h = (h_1, \cdots, h_R)$ . Using Macaulay's Theorem, we derive new inequalities relating $n$, $l$, the signature $(p, q)$ of the coefficient matrix of $M(z, \bar{z})$ , and $R$ (the rank of $M(z, \bar{z})\|z\|^{2l}$ ) and extend these results to norms of arbitrary signatures, which hold uniformly for all bidegrees of $M(z, \bar{z})$.</description>

      <title>The asphericity of locally finite infinite configuration spaces and Weierstrass entire coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ and $C^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ denote the locally finite infinite ordered and unordered configuration spaces of the complex plane. We prove that both $Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ and $C^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ are aspherical. We further obtain a locally finite analogue of the braid exact sequence, \[ 1\longrightarrow H^{lf}(\infty)\longrightarrow B^{lf}(\infty)\longrightarrow \Aut(\N)\longrightarrow 1, \] where $H^{lf}(\infty)=\pi_1(Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C))$ and $B^{lf}(\infty)=\pi_1(Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)//\Aut(\N))$, the fundamental group of the homotopy quotient of $Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ by $\Aut(\N)$. Building on this, we classify connected countably infinite--sheeted covering spaces and give a criterion for when such a covering can be realized from the zero set of a family of entire functions $F:X\times\C\to\C$. In particular, if $\pi_1(X)$ is free and $H^2(X;\Z)=0$, then every countably infinite--sheeted covering space over $X$ is realizable.</description>

      <title>Fano Fibrations and Twisted K\"ahler-Einstein Metrics I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of two papers studying both the geometric structure of Fano fibrations and the application to K\"ahler-Ricci flows developing a singularity in finite time. Given a Fano fibration which is generated by Kawamata's theorem from a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ endowed with an ample, rational line bundle $L$ and non-nef canonical line bundle $K_X$, we construct a $(1,1)$-form on the regular part of the base analytic variety which is related to the Weil-Petersson metric. It is also proven that the singular K\"ahler metric constructed by Zhang, Zhang, on the base analytic variety satisfies a twisted K\"ahler-Einstein equation involving this $(1,1)$-form and, for a submersion, that the Chern classes of $X$ and the base manifold decompose in terms of this $(1,1)$-form.</description>

      <title>Fano Fibrations and Twisted K\"ahler-Einstein Metrics II: The K\"ahler-Ricci Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second of two papers studying both the geometric structure of Fano fibrations and the application to K\"ahler-Ricci flows developing a singularity in finite time. We assume that the K\"ahler-Ricci flow on a compact K\"ahler manifold has a rational initial metric and develops a singularity in finite time such that the manifold admits a Fano fibration structure. Moreover, it is assumed that the volume form of the flow collapses uniformly at the rate of $C^{-1}(T-t)^{n-m} \Omega \leq \omega(t)^n\leq C(T-t)^{n-m}\Omega$. Under this setting, a diameter bound is obtained in any compact set away from singular fibres and the diameter of the fibres is proven to collapse at the optimal rate $\sqrt{T-t}$. Furthermore, several precise $C^0$-estimates are proven for the potential of the complex Monge-Ampere flow which involve the potentials of singular twisted K\"ahler-Einstein metrics on the base variety from part I. Finally, in the case of K\"ahler-Einstein Fano fibres, we deduce Type I scalar curvature in any compact set away from singular fibres and globally for a submersion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:0810.0782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is proved that an unbranched Riemann domain $\Pi : X\rightarrow Y$ over an arbitrary Stein complex space of dimension $n\geq 2$ is Stein if and only if $X$ is cohomologically $2$-complete with respect to the structure sheaf ${\mathcal{O}}_{X}$ and every topologically trivial holomorphic line bundle over $X$ is associated to a Cartier divisor.</description>

      <title>Generalized partial-slice monogenic functions: the octonionic case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 378 (2025), 851-883], the concept of generalized partial-slice monogenic (or regular) function was introduced over Clifford algebras. The present paper shall extend the study of generalized partial-slice monogenic functions from the associative case of Clifford algebras to non-associative alternative algebras, such as octonions. The new class of functions encompasses the regular functions [Rend. Sem. Mat. Univ. Padova 50 (1973), 251-267] and slice regular functions [Rocky Mountain J. Math. 40 (2010), no. 1, 225-241] over octonions, indeed both appear in the theory as special cases. In the non-associative setting of octonions, we shall develop some fundamental properties such as identity theorem, Representation Formula, Cauchy (and Cauchy-Pompeiu) integral formula, maximum modulus principle, Fueter polynomials, Taylor series expansion. As a complement, the paper also introduces and discusses the notion of generalized partial-slice (and regular) functions. Although the study is limited to the case of octonions, it is clear from the statements and the arguments in the proofs that the results hold more in general in real alternative algebras equipped with a notion of conjugation.</description>

      <title>The Theory Of Auxiliary Weierstrassian Zeta Functions And Zeta Differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we expand the theory of Weierstrassian elliptic functions by introducing auxiliary zeta functions $\zeta_\lambda$, zeta differences of first kind $\Delta_\lambda$ and second kind $\Delta_{\lambda,\mu}$ where $\lambda,\mu=1,2,3$. Fundamental and novel results pertaining to these functions are proven. Furthermore, results already existing in the literature are translated in terms of auxiliary zeta functions. Their relationship to Jacobian elliptic functions and Jacobian functions are given.</description>

      <title>On some indices of foliations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a relationship between the Milnor number, the $\chi$-number, and the Tjurina number of a foliation with respect to an effective balanced divisor of separatrices. Moreover, using the G\'omez-Mont--Seade--Verjovsky index, we prove that the difference between the multiplicity and the Tjurina number of a foliation with respect to a reduced curve is independent of the foliation. We also derive a local formula for the Tjurina number of a foliation with respect to a reduced curve. From a global point of view, these results lead to the following consequences: we provide a new proof of a global result regarding the multiplicity of a foliation due to Cerveau-Lins Neto and a new proof of a Soares's inequality for the sum of the Milnor number of an invariant curve of a foliation. Additionally, we obtain bounds for the global Tjurina number of a foliation on the complex projective plane. Finally, we provide an answer to the conjecture posed by Alc\'antara and Mozo-Fern\'andez about foliations on the complex projective plane having a unique singularity.</description>

      <title>On Bott-Chern and Aeppli cohomologies of two-dimensional toroidal groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A toroidal group is a generalization of a complex torus, and is obtained as the quotient of the complex Euclidean space $\mathbb{C}^n$ by a discrete subgroup. Toroidal groups with finite-dimensional cohomology, called theta toroidal groups, are known to exhibit behavior analogous to that of complex tori. We compute Bott--Chern and Aeppli cohomologies for two-dimensional non-compact theta toroidal groups.</description>
