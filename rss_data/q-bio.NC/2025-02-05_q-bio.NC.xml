      <title>Human fields and their impact on brain waves A pilot study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During brain function, groups of neurons fire synchronously. When these groups are large enough, the resulting electrical signals can be measured on the scalp using Electroencephalography (EEG). The amplitude of these signals can be significant depending on the size and synchronization of the neural activity. EEG waves exhibit distinct patterns based on the brain's state, such as whether it is asleep, awake, engaged in mental calculations, or performing other cognitive functions. Additionally, these patterns can be modified by external factors, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS involves bringing an antenna that generates variable electromagnetic fields close to specific areas of the skull to treat certain pathologies. Given that the human body naturally generates magnetic fields, a question arises: Can these fields influence the EEG by modulating neuronal function, causing a resonance effect, or through some unknown interaction? This study investigated whether approaching the palm of the hand to the top of the head (Intervention) could induce effects in the EEG. Power Spectral Density (PSD) was obtained for the 30 seconds preceding the intervention (PSD_pre) and the final 30 seconds of the intervention (PSD_last). The exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggests that the median of PSD_pre is greater than the median of PSD_last at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.004353). In contrast, in the control group, the test indicates that at the 95% confidence level (p-value = 0.7667), the median of PSD_pre is not greater than the median of PSD_last.</description>

      <title>Structural constraints to compare phenomenal experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article defines a partial order structure to study the relationship between levels and contents of conscious subjective experience in a single mathematical set-up. We understand phenomenal structure as extrapolated relationships among experiences, instead of fixed properties of specific experiences. Our mathematical account is based on multilayer network theory. Multilayer theory is a generalization of graph and network theory, widely used in several scientific domains. This structure is also the underlying conceptual and mathematical structure of most current models of conscious experience. From our simple set of assumptions, yet rigorous analysis, we conclude that assuming the comparison and quantification among phenomenal experiences yield only partial comparison, rather than commonly assumed absolute comparability. This has implications for evolutionary and animal consciousness: evolution may encompass diverse modes of experiencing, not necessarily implying larger ones on an absolute scale. Our characterization elucidates structural constraints on experiential comparisons imposed by assumptions and choices made by modellers as active participants in the scientific process. In summary, in light of our phenomenological intuitions, it might be right that some experiences carry qualitative aspects that make them incompatible or non-comparable with other experiences, quantitatively speaking. Some experiences are comparable (e.g. at some experiential levels), but others are not. These results have direct implications for consciousness science, evolution and animal consciousness.</description>

      <title>BrainOOD: Out-of-distribution Generalizable Brain Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neuroscience, identifying distinct patterns linked to neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Autism, is critical for early diagnosis and effective intervention. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising in analyzing brain networks, but there are two major challenges in using GNNs: (1) distribution shifts in multi-site brain network data, leading to poor Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, and (2) limited interpretability in identifying key brain regions critical to neurological disorders. Existing graph OOD methods, while effective in other domains, struggle with the unique characteristics of brain networks. To bridge these gaps, we introduce BrainOOD, a novel framework tailored for brain networks that enhances GNNs' OOD generalization and interpretability. BrainOOD framework consists of a feature selector and a structure extractor, which incorporates various auxiliary losses including an improved Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB) objective to recover causal subgraphs. By aligning structure selection across brain networks and filtering noisy features, BrainOOD offers reliable interpretations of critical brain regions. Our approach outperforms 16 existing methods and improves generalization to OOD subjects by up to 8.5%. Case studies highlight the scientific validity of the patterns extracted, which aligns with the findings in known neuroscience literature. We also propose the first OOD brain network benchmark, which provides a foundation for future research in this field. Our code is available at https://github.com/AngusMonroe/BrainOOD.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology on a lattice of multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multicomplex structure is defined from an ordered lattice of multigraphs. This structure will help us to observe the features of Persistent Homology in this context, its interaction with the ordering and the repercussions of the process of merging multigraphs in the calculation of the Betti numbers. For the latter, an extended version of the incremental algorithm is provided. The ideas here developed are mainly oriented to the original example described in [10] and used more extensively in [11] in the context of the formalization of the notion of embodiment in Neuroscience.</description>

      <title>A Revisit of Total Correlation in Disentangled Variational Auto-Encoder with Partial Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fully disentangled variational auto-encoder (VAE) aims to identify disentangled latent components from observations. However, enforcing full independence between all latent components may be too strict for certain datasets. In some cases, multiple factors may be entangled together in a non-separable manner, or a single independent semantic meaning could be represented by multiple latent components within a higher-dimensional manifold. To address such scenarios with greater flexibility, we develop the Partially Disentangled VAE (PDisVAE), which generalizes the total correlation (TC) term in fully disentangled VAEs to a partial correlation (PC) term. This framework can handle group-wise independence and can naturally reduce to either the standard VAE or the fully disentangled VAE. Validation through three synthetic experiments demonstrates the correctness and practicality of PDisVAE. When applied to real-world datasets, PDisVAE discovers valuable information that is difficult to find using fully disentangled VAEs, implying its versatility and effectiveness.</description>
