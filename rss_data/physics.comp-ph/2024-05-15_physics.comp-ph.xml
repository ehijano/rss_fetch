      <title>Multiresolution of the one dimensional free-particle propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel methods to integrate the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation within the framework of multiscale approximation is presented. The methods are based on symplectic splitting algorithms to separate the kinetic and potential parts of the corresponding propagator. The semigroup associated with the free-particle Schr\"odinger operator is represented in a multiwavelet basis. The propagator is effectively discretized with a contour deformation technique, which overcomes the challenges presented by previous discretization methods. The discretized operator is then employed in simple numerical simulations to test the validity of the implementation and to benchmark its precision.</description>

      <title>LATTE: an atomic environment descriptor based on Cartesian tensor contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new descriptor for local atomic environments, to be used in combination with machine learning models for the construction of interatomic potentials. The Local Atomic Tensors Trainable Expansion (LATTE) allows for the efficient construction of a variable number of many-body terms with learnable parameters, resulting in a descriptor that is efficient, expressive, and can be scaled to suit different accuracy and computational cost requirements. We compare this new descriptor to existing ones on several systems, showing it to be competitive with very fast potentials at one end of the spectrum, and extensible to an accuracy close to the state of the art.</description>

      <title>Undisturbed velocity recovery with transient and weak inertia effects in volume-filtered simulations of particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In volume-filtered Euler-Lagrange simulations of particle-laden flows, the fluid forces acting on a particle are estimated using reduced models, which rely on the knowledge of the local undisturbed flow for that particle. Since the two-way coupling between the particle and the fluid creates a local flow perturbation, the filtered fluid velocity interpolated to the particle location must be corrected prior to estimating the fluid forces, so as to subtract the contribution of this perturbation and recover the local undisturbed flow with good accuracy. In this manuscript, we present a new model for estimating a particle's self-induced flow disturbance that accounts for its transient development and for inertial effects related to finite particle Reynolds numbers. The model also does not require the direction of the momentum feedback to align with the direction of the particle's relative velocity, allowing force contributions other than the steady drag force to be considered. It is based upon the linearization of the volume-filtered equations governing the particle's self-induced flow disturbance, such that their solution can be expressed as a linear combination of regularized transient Stokeslet contributions. Tested on a range of numerical cases, the model is shown to consistently estimate the particle's self-induced flow disturbance with high accuracy both in steady and highly transient flow environments, as well as for finite particle Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Online Test-time Adaptation for Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable more efficient molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with ab initio accuracy, which have been used in various domains of physical science. However, distribution shift between training and test data causes deterioration of the test performance of MLIPs, and even leads to collapse of MD simulations. In this work, we propose an online Test-time Adaptation Interatomic Potential (TAIP) framework to improve the generalization on test data. Specifically, we design a dual-level self-supervised learning approach that leverages global structure and atomic local environment information to align the model with the test data. Extensive experiments demonstrate TAIP's capability to bridge the domain gap between training and test dataset without additional data. TAIP enhances the test performance on various benchmarks, from small molecule datasets to complex periodic molecular systems with various types of elements. Remarkably, it also enables stable MD simulations where the corresponding baseline models collapse.</description>

      <title>The TDHF code Sky3D version 1.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sky3D code has been widely used to describe nuclear ground states, collective vibrational excitations, and heavy-ion collisions. The approach is based on Skyrme forces or related energy density functionals. The static and dynamic equations are solved on a three-dimensional grid, and pairing is been implemented in the BCS approximation. This updated version of the code aims to facilitate the calculation of nuclear strength functions in the regime of linear response theory, while retaining all existing functionality and use cases. The strength functions are benchmarked against available RPA codes, and the user has the freedom of choice when selecting the nature of external excitation (from monopole to hexadecapole and more). Some utility programs are also provided that calculate the strength function from the time-dependent output of the dynamic calculations of the Sky3D code.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Time Stepping for a Two-Time Integro-Differential Equation in Non-Equilibrium Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium Green's function gives access to one-body observables for quantum systems. Of particular interest are quantities such as density, currents, and absorption spectra which are important for interpreting experimental results in quantum transport and spectroscopy. We present an integration scheme for the Green's function's equations of motion, the Kadanoff-Baym equations (KBE), which is both adaptive in the time integrator step size and method order as well as the history integration order. We analyze the importance of solving the KBE self-consistently and show that adapting the order of history integral evaluation is important for obtaining accurate results. To examine the efficiency of our method, we compare runtimes to a state of the art fixed time step integrator for several test systems and show an order of magnitude speedup at similar levels of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Performance of wave function and Green's functions based methods for non equilibrium many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of non equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems essentially employ either (i) explicit treatments, relying on truncation of the expansion of the many-body wave function, (ii) compressed representations of the many-body wave function, or (iii) evolution of an effective (downfolded) representation through Green's functions. In this work, we select representative cases of each of the methods and address how these complementary approaches capture the dynamics driven by intense field perturbations to non equilibrium states. Under strong driving, the systems are characterized by strong entanglement of the single particle density matrix and natural populations approaching those of a strongly interacting equilibrium system. We generate a representative set of results that are numerically exact and form a basis for critical comparison of the distinct families of methods. We demonstrate that the compressed formulation based on similarity transformed Hamiltonians (coupled cluster approach) is practically exact in weak fields and, hence, weakly or moderately correlated systems. Coupled cluster, however, struggles for strong driving fields, under which the system exhibits strongly correlated behavior, as measured by the von Neumann entropy of the single particle density matrix. The dynamics predicted by Green's functions in the (widely popular) GW approximation are less accurate by improve significantly upon the mean-field results in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <title>Impact of Surface Adsorbates and Dimensionality on Templating of Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites (HPs) are promising materials for various optoelectronic applications, yet a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics is still elusive. Here, we offer insight into the dynamics of prototypical 2D HPs based on MAPbI$_3$ as a function of linker molecule and the number of perovskite layers using atomic scale simulations. We show that the layers closest to the linker undergo transitions that are distinct from those of the interior layers. These transitions can take place anywhere between a few tens of Kelvin below to more than 100 K above the cubic-tetragonal transition of bulk MAPbI$_3$. In combination with the thickness of the perovskite layer this enables one to template phase transitions and tune the dynamics over a wide temperature range. Our results thereby reveal the details of an important and generalizable design mechanism for tuning the properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>ICO learning as a measure of transient chaos in PT-symmetric Li\'enard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the implications of the unsupervised learning rule known as Input-Correlations (ICO) learning in the nonlinear dynamics of two linearly coupled PT-symmetric Li\'enard oscillators. The fixed points of the oscillator have been evaluated analytically and the Jacobian linearization is employed to study their stability. We find that on increasing the amplitude of the external periodic drive, the system exhibits period-doubling cascade to chaos within a specific parametric regime wherein we observe emergent chaotic dynamics. We further notice that the system indicates an intermittency route to chaos in the chaotic regime. Finally, in the period-4 regime of our bifurcation analysis, we predict the emergence of transient chaos which eventually settles down to a period-2 oscillator response which has been further validated by both the maximal Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) using the well-known Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization technique and the Hilbert Transform of the time-series. In the transiently chaotic regime, we deploy the ICO learning to analyze the time-series from which we identify that when the chaotic evolution transforms into periodic dynamics, the synaptic weight associated with the time-series of the loss oscillator exhibits stationary temporal evolution. This signifies that in the periodic regime, there is no overlap between the filtered signals obtained from the time-series of the coupled PT-symmetric oscillators. In addition, the temporal evolution of the weight associated with the stimulus mimics the behaviour of the Hilbert transform of the time-series.</description>

      <title>Molecular Algebraic Geometry: Electronic Structure of H$_3^+$ as Algebraic Variety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we demonstrate the restricted Hartree-Fock electronic structure computation of the molecule $H_3^+$ through computational algebra. We approximate the Hartree-Fock total energy by a polynomial composed of LCAO coefficients and atomic distances so that the minimum is determined by a set of polynomial equations. We get the roots of this set of equations through the techniques of computational algebraic geometry, namely, the Gr\"obner basis and primary ideal decomposition. This treatment enables us to describe the electronic structures as algebraic varieties in terms of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Equivariant Neural Networks for Charge Density Prediction in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The calculation of electron density distribution using density functional theory (DFT) in materials and molecules is central to the study of their quantum and macro-scale properties, yet accurate and efficient calculation remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce ChargE3Net, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network for predicting electron density in atomic systems. ChargE3Net enables the learning of higher-order equivariant feature to achieve high predictive accuracy and model expressivity. We show that ChargE3Net exceeds the performance of prior work on diverse sets of molecules and materials. When trained on the massive dataset of over 100K materials in the Materials Project database, our model is able to capture the complexity and variability in the data, leading to a significant 26.7% reduction in self-consistent iterations when used to initialize DFT calculations on unseen materials. Furthermore, we show that non-self-consistent DFT calculations using our predicted charge densities yield near-DFT performance on electronic and thermodynamic property prediction at a fraction of the computational cost. Further analysis attributes the greater predictive accuracy to improved modeling of systems with high angular variations. These results illuminate a pathway towards a machine learning-accelerated ab initio calculations for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Error estimation in current noisy quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main important features of the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is the correct evaluation and consideration of errors. In this paper, we analyze the main sources of errors in current (IBM) quantum computers and we present a useful tool (TED-qc) designed to facilitate the total error probability expected for any quantum circuit. We propose this total error probability as the best way to estimate a lower bound for the fidelity in the NISQ era, avoiding the necessity of comparing the quantum calculations with any classical one. In order to contrast the robustness of our tool we compute the total error probability that may occur in three different quantum models: 1) the Ising model, 2) the Quantum-Phase Estimation (QPE), and 3) the Grover's algorithm. For each model, the main quantities of interest are computed and benchmarked against the reference simulator's results as a function of the error probability for a representative and statistically significant sample size. The analysis is satisfactory in more than the $99\%$ of the cases. In addition, we study how error mitigation techniques are able to eliminate the noise induced during the measurement. These results have been calculated for the IBM quantum computers, but both the tool and the analysis can be easily extended to any other quantum computer.</description>

      <title>A unified perspective on exponential tilt and bridge algorithms for rare trajectories of discrete Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article analyzes and compares two general techniques of rare event simulation for generating paths of Markov processes over fixed time horizons: exponential tilting and stochastic bridge. These two methods allow to accurately compute the probability that a Markov process ends within a rare region, which is unlikely to be attained. Exponential tilting is a general technique for obtaining an alternative or tilted sampling probability measure, under which the Markov process becomes likely to hit the rare region at terminal time. The stochastic bridge technique involves conditioning paths towards two endpoints: the terminal point and the initial one. The terminal point is generated from some appropriately chosen probability distribution that covers well the rare region. We show that both methods belong to the class of importance sampling procedures, by providing a common mathematical framework of these two conceptually different methods of sampling rare trajectories. We also conduct a numerical comparison of these two methods, revealing distinct areas of application for each Monte Carlo method, where they exhibit superior efficiency. Detailed simulation algorithms are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of fully replacing a plasma physics kinetic simulator with a graph neural network-based simulator. We focus on this class of surrogate models given the similarity between their message-passing update mechanism and the traditional physics solver update, and the possibility of enforcing known physical priors into the graph construction and update. We show that our model learns the kinetic plasma dynamics of the one-dimensional plasma model, a predecessor of contemporary kinetic plasma simulation codes, and recovers a wide range of well-known kinetic plasma processes, including plasma thermalization, electrostatic fluctuations about thermal equilibrium, and the drag on a fast sheet and Landau damping. We compare the performance against the original plasma model in terms of run-time, conservation laws, and temporal evolution of key physical quantities. The limitations of the model are presented and possible directions for higher-dimensional surrogate models for kinetic plasmas are discussed.</description>

      <title>Consistent Second-Order Treatment of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Dynamic Correlation in Quasidegenerate N-Electron Valence Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation and implementation of second-order quasidegenerate N-electron valence perturbation theory (QDNEVPT2) that provides a balanced and accurate description of spin-orbit coupling and dynamic correlation effects in multiconfigurational electronic states. In our approach, the energies and wavefunctions of electronic states are computed by treating electron repulsion and spin-orbit coupling operators as equal perturbations to the non-relativistic complete active-space wavefunctions and their contributions are incorporated fully up to the second order. The spin-orbit effects are described using the Breit-Pauli (BP) or exact two-component Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH) Hamiltonians within spin-orbit mean-field approximation. The resulting second-order methods (BP2- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2) are capable of treating spin-orbit coupling effects in nearly degenerate electronic states by diagonalizing an effective Hamiltonian expanded in a compact non-relativistic basis. For a variety of atoms and small molecules across the entire periodic table, we demonstrate that DKH2-QDNEVPT2 is competitive in accuracy with variational two-component relativistic theories. BP2-QDNEVPT2 shows high accuracy for the second- and third-period elements, but its performance deteriorates for heavier atoms and molecules. We also consider the first-order spin-orbit QDNEVPT2 approximations (BP1- and DKH1-QDNEVPT2), among which DKH1-QDNEVPT2 is reliable but less accurate than DKH2-QDNEVPT2. Both DKH1- and DKH2-QDNEVPT2 hold promise as efficient and accurate electronic structure methods for treating electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling in a variety of applications.</description>
