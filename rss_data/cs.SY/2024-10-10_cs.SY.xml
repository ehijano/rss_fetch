      <title>GreenLight-Gym: A Reinforcement Learning Benchmark Environment for Greenhouse Crop Production Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling greenhouse crop production systems is a complex task due to uncertain and non-linear dynamics between crops, indoor and outdoor climate, and economics. The declining number of skilled growers necessitates the development of autonomous greenhouse control systems. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach that can learn a control policy to automate greenhouse management. RL optimises a control policy through interactions with a model of the greenhouse while guided by an economic-based reward function. However, its application to real-world systems is limited due to discrepancies between models and real-world dynamics. Moreover, RL controllers may struggle to maintain state constraints while optimising the primary objective, especially when models inadequately capture the adverse effects of constraint violations on crop growth. Also, the generalisation to novel states, for example, due to unseen weather trajectories, is underexplored in RL-based greenhouse control. This work addresses these challenges through three key contributions. First, we present GreenLight-Gym, the first open-source environment designed for training and evaluating RL algorithms on the state-of-the-art greenhouse model GreenLight. GreenLight-Gym enables the community to benchmark RL-based control methodologies. Second, we compare two reward-shaping approaches, using either a multiplicative or additive penalty, to enforce state boundaries. The additive penalty achieves more stable training while better adhering to state constraints, while the multiplicative penalty yields marginally higher profits. Finally, we evaluate RL performance on a disjoint training and testing weather dataset, demonstrating improved generalisation to unseen conditions. Our environment and experiment scripts are open-sourced, facilitating innovative research on learning-based greenhouse control.</description>

      <title>Modeling Buffer Occupancy in bittide Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bittide mechanism enables logically synchronous computation across distributed systems by leveraging the continuous frame transmission inherent to wired networks such as Ethernet. Instead of relying on a global clock, bittide uses a decentralized control system to adjust local clock frequencies, ensuring all nodes operate with a consistent notion of time by utilizing elastic buffers at each node to absorb frequency variations. This paper presents an analysis of the steady-state occupancy of these elastic buffers, a critical factor influencing system latency. Using a fluid model of the bittide system, we prove that buffer occupancy converges and derive an explicit formula for the steady-state value in terms of system parameters, including network topology, physical latencies, and controller gains. This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing buffer sizes and minimizing latency in bittide-based distributed systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear High-Pass Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear high-pass phenomena matter in signal processing, circuits, and control. In nonlinear systems, however, there is no working definition of high-pass behavior. Any definition would have to agree with the existing theory on linear systems and offer concrete benefits for nonlinear systems above and beyond existing nonlinear theory. To satisfy these two requirements, we propose to define: a nonlinear input-output system is high-pass if its output is stable with respect to the derivative of the input. We first show that definition generalizes high-pass resistor-capacitor circuit analysis to accommodate nonlinear resistors. We then show that this definition generalizes the steady-state disturbance rejection property of integral feedback controllers for linear systems. The theoretical payoff is that low-frequency disturbance rejection is captured by a quantitative, non-asymptotic output cost bound. Finally, we raise theoretical questions about compositionality and noncommutativity of nonlinear operators.</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Data-Enabled Policy Optimization for Linear Quadratic Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-enabled policy optimization (DeePO) is a newly proposed method to attack the open problem of direct adaptive LQR. In this work, we extend the DeePO framework to the linear quadratic tracking (LQT) with offline data. By introducing a covariance parameterization of the LQT policy, we derive a direct data-driven formulation of the LQT problem. Then, we use gradient descent method to iteratively update the parameterized policy to find an optimal LQT policy. Moreover, by revealing the connection between DeePO and model-based policy optimization, we prove the linear convergence of the DeePO iteration. Finally, a numerical experiment is given to validate the convergence results. We hope our work paves the way to direct adaptive LQT with online closed-loop data.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coordination problem of multi-vehicle systems is of great interests in the area of autonomous driving and multi-vehicle control. This work mainly focuses on multi-task coordination problem of a group of vehicles with a bicycle model and some specific control objectives, including collision avoidance, connectivity maintenance and convergence to desired destinations. The basic idea is to develop a proper Lyapunov-like barrier function for all tasks and a distributed controller could be built in the presence of misbehaving vehicles. Control protocols are provided for both leader vehicle and follower vehicles. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware Fully Model-Free Event-triggered Cloud-based HVAC Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy is a major concern when computing-as-a-service (CaaS) platforms, e.g., cloud-computing platforms, are utilized for building automation, as CaaS platforms can infer sensitive information, such as occupancy, using the sensor measurements of a building. Although the existing encrypted model-based control algorithms can ensure the security and privacy of sensor measurements, they are highly complex to implement and require high computational resources, which result in a high cost of using CaaS platforms. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an encrypted fully model-free event-triggered cloud-based HVAC control framework that ensures the privacy of occupancy information and minimizes the communication and computation overhead associated with encrypted HVAC control. To this end, we first develop a model-free controller for regulating indoor temperature and CO2 levels. We then design a model-free event-triggering unit which reduces the communication and computation costs of encrypted HVAC control using an optimal triggering policy. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed encrypted fully model-free event-triggered cloud-based HVAC control framework using the TRNSYS simulator, comparing it to an encrypted model-based event-triggered control framework, which uses model predictive control to regulate the indoor climate. Our numerical results demonstrate that, compared to the encrypted model-based method, the proposed fully model-free framework improves the control performance while reducing the communication and computation costs. More specifically, it reduces the communication between the system and the CaaS platform by 64% amount, and its computation time is 75% less than that of the model-based control.</description>

      <title>Spectrally Efficient LDPC Codes For IRIG-106 Waveforms via Random Puncturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes form part of the IRIG-106 standard and have been successfully deployed for the Telemetry Group version of shaped-offset quadrature phase shift keying (SOQPSK-TG) modulation. Recently, LDPC code solutions have been proposed and optimized for continuous phase modulations (CPMs), including the pulse code modulation/frequency modulation (PCM/FM) and the multi-h CPM developed by the Advanced Range TeleMetry program (ARTM CPM). These codes were shown to perform around one dB from the respective channel capacities of these modulations. In this paper, we consider the effect of random puncturing of these LDPC codes to further improve spectrum efficiency. We present numerical simulation results that affirm the robust decoding performance promised by LDPC codes designed for ARTM CPM.</description>

      <title>Nationally Scalable Hydrogen Fueling Infrastructure Deployment: A Megaregion Analysis and Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonizing regional and long-haul freight faces challenges due to the limitations of battery-electric vehicles and infrastructure. Hydrogen fuel cell medium- and heavy-duty vehicles (MHDVs) present a promising alternative, aligning with the Department of Energy's decarbonization goals. Historically, alternative fuels like compressed natural gas and propane gas have seen slow adoption due to infrastructure barriers. To prevent similar setbacks, planning for zero-emission hydrogen fueling infrastructure is critical. This research develops plans for affordable and accessible hydrogen refueling stations, supporting the decarbonized freight system and benefiting underserved and rural communities by improving air quality, reducing noise pollution, and enhancing energy resilience.It provides a blueprint for replacing diesel in Class 8 trucks with hydrogen fueling solutions, focusing on the Texas Triangle Megaregion (I-45, I-35, I-10), the I-10 corridor between San Antonio, TX, and Los Angeles, CA, and the I-5/CA-99 corridors between Los Angeles and San Francisco. This area accounts for ~8.5% of U.S. heavy-duty freight volume. Using the OR-AGENT (Optimal Regional Architecture Generation for Electrified National Transport) framework, the study analyzes vehicles, freight networks, and energy systems. The framework integrates data on freight mobility, traffic, weather, and energy pathways to deliver optimized powertrain architectures and hydrogen fueling infrastructure deployment. It assesses all vehicle origin-destination pairs and feasible fueling station locations, using a genetic algorithm to identify the minimum number and optimal locations of hydrogen stations. It also determines fuel schedules and quantities, ensuring no vehicle is stranded. A deployment roadmap outlines strategic hydrogen refueling infrastructure rollout across multiple adoption scenarios.</description>

      <title>Classification of simulation relations for symbolic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstraction-based control design is a promising approach for ensuring safety-critical control of complex cyber-physical systems. A key aspect of this methodology is the relation between the original and abstract systems, which ensures that the abstract controller can be transformed into a valid controller for the original system through a concretization procedure. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and systematic framework that characterizes various simulation relations, through their associated concretization procedures. We introduce the concept of augmented system, which universally enables a feedback refinement relation with the abstract system. This augmented system encapsulates the specific characteristics of each simulation relation within an interface, enabling a plug-and-play control architecture. Our results demonstrate that the existence of a particular simulation relation between the concrete and abstract systems is equivalent to the implementability of a specific control architecture, which depends on the considered simulation relation. This allows us to introduce new types of relations, and to establish the advantages and drawbacks of different relations, which we exhibit through detailed examples.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Metriplectic System via Free Energy and System~Identification via Bilevel Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work generalizes the classical metriplectic formalism to model Hamiltonian systems with nonconservative dissipation. Classical metriplectic representations allow for the description of energy conservation and production of entropy via a suitable selection of an entropy function and a bilinear symmetric metric. By relaxing the Casimir invariance requirement of the entropy function, this paper shows that the generalized formalism induces the free energy analogous to thermodynamics. The monotonic change of free energy can serve as a more precise criterion than mechanical energy or entropy alone. This paper provides examples of the generalized metriplectic system in a 2-dimensional Hamiltonian system and $\mathrm{SO}(3)$. This paper also provides a bilevel convex optimization approach for the identification of the metriplectic system given measurements of the system.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Distributed Computation of Reachable Sets for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06321v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of distributed reachable set computation for multi-agent systems (MASs) interacting over an undirected, stationary graph. A full state-feedback control input for such MASs depends no only on the current agent's state, but also of its neighbors. However, in most MAS applications, the dynamics are obscured by individual agents. This makes reachable set computation, in a fully distributed manner, a challenging problem. We utilize the ideas of polytopic reachable set approximation and generalize it to a MAS setup. We formulate the resulting sub-problems in a fully distributed manner and provide convergence guarantees for the associated computations. The proposed algorithm's convergence is proved for two cases: static MAS graphs, and time-varying graphs under certain restrictions.</description>

      <title>Work-in-Progress: Traded Control Transfer for Managing Real-Time Sensor Uncertainties in Autonomous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At Levels 2 and 3 of autonomous driving defined by the Society of Auto-motive Engineers, drivers must take on certain driving responsibilities, and automated driving must sometimes yield to human control. This situation can occur in real time due to uncertainties in sensor measurements caused by environmental factors like fog or smoke. To address this challenge, we propose a method to manage real-time sensor uncertainties in autonomous vehicles by monitoring sensor conflicts and dynamically adjusting control authority to maintain safe operation. However, to achieve this, we have introduced a novel metric called the Degree of Conflicts (DoC), which quantifies the conflict between real-time sensor data by measuring the differences between data from multiple sensors. Our approach aims to demonstrate the importance of selecting an appropriate DoC threshold for transferring control between the automation agent and the human driver. The results have shown that choosing the correct DoC threshold can enhance safety by promptly handing over the driving control from the automation system to the human driver in challenging conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In precision agriculture, integrating advanced technologies is crucial for optimizing plant growth and health monitoring. Cyber-physical system (CPS) platforms tailored to specific agricultural environments have emerged, but the diversity of these environments poses challenges in developing adaptive CPS platforms. This paper explores rapid prototyping methods to address these challenges, focusing on non-destructive techniques for estimating plant growth. We present a CPS prototype that combines sensors, microcontrollers, digital image processing, and predictive modeling to measure leaf area and biomass accumulation in hydroponic environments. Our results show that the prototype effectively monitors and predicts plant growth, highlighting the potential of rapid CPS prototyping in promoting sustainability and improving crop yields at a moderate cost of hardware.</description>

      <title>MPC-guided, Data-driven Fuzzy Controller Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful control technique for online optimization using system model-based predictions over a finite time horizon. However, the computational cost MPC requires can be prohibitive in resource-constrained computer systems. This paper presents a fuzzy controller synthesis framework guided by MPC. In the proposed framework, training data is obtained from MPC closed-loop simulations and is used to optimize a low computational complexity controller to emulate the response of MPC. In particular, autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controllers are trained using data obtained from MPC closed-loop simulations, such that each ARMA controller emulates the response of the MPC controller under particular desired conditions. Using a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy system, the responses of all the trained ARMA controllers are then weighted depending on the measured system conditions, resulting in the Fuzzy-Autoregressive Moving Average (F-ARMA) controller. The effectiveness of the trained F-ARMA controllers is illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Variations in Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Frameworks for Joint Optimizations in UAV Swarm Networks: Recent Evolution, Challenges, and Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can effectively execute surveillance, connectivity, and computing services to ground users (GUs). These missions require trajectory planning, UAV-GUs association, task offloading, next-hop selection, and resources such as transmit power, bandwidth, caching, and computing allocation to improve network performances. Owing to the highly dynamic topology, limited resources, and non-availability of global knowledge, optimizing network performance in UAVSNs is very intricate. Hence, it requires an adaptive joint optimization framework that can tackle both discrete and continuous decision variables to ensure optimal network performance under dynamic constraints. Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive actor-critic framework can efficiently address these problems. This paper investigates the recent evolutions of actor-critic frameworks to deal with joint optimization problems in UAVSNs. In addition, challenges and potential solutions are addressed as research directions.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for safety quantification of non-linear stochastic systems with unknown additive noise distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach to quantify safety for non-linear, discrete-time stochastic systems with unknown noise distribution. We define safety as the probability that the system remains in a given region of the state space for a given time horizon and, to quantify it, we present an approach based on Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs). In particular, we introduce an inner approximation of the stochastic program to design a SBF in terms of a chance-constrained optimisation problem, which allows us to leverage the scenario approach theory to design a SBF from samples of the system with Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees. Our approach leads to tractable, robust linear programs, which enable us to assert safety for non-linear models that were otherwise deemed infeasible with existing methods. To further mitigate the computational complexity of our approach, we exploit the structure of the system dynamics and rely on spatial data structures to accelerate the construction and solution of the underlying optimisation problem. We show the efficacy and validity of our framework in several benchmarks, showing that our approach can obtain substantially tighter certificates compared to state-of-the-art with a confidence that is several orders of magnitude higher.</description>

      <title>Non-overshooting output shaping for switched linear systems under arbitrary switching using eigenstructure assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the analytical control design for a pair of switched linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems that are subject to arbitrary switching signals. A state feedback controller design method is proposed to obtain an eigenstructure assignment that ensures that the closed-loop switched system is globally asymptotically stable, and the outputs achieve the non-overshooting tracking of a step reference. Our analysis indicates whether non-overshooting or even monotonic tracking is achievable for the given system and considered outputs and provides a choice of possible eigenstructures to be assigned to the constituent subsystems. We derive a structural condition that verifies the feasibility of the chosen assignment. A constructive algorithm to obtain suitable feedback matrices is provided, and the method is illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Trajectory Tracking of a Four wheeled Mecanum Mobile Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four Wheeled Mecanum Robot (FWMR) possess the capability to move in any direction on a plane making it a cornerstone system in modern industrial operations. Despite the extreme maneuverability offered by FWMR, the practical implementation or real-time simulation of Mecanum wheel robots encounters substantial challenges in trajectory tracking control. In this research work, we present a finite-time control law using backstepping technique to perform stabilization and trajectory tracking objectives for a FWMR system. A rigorous stability proof is presented and explicit computation of the finite-time is provided. For tracking objective, we demonstrate the results taking an S-shaped trajectory inclined towards collision avoidance applications. Simulation validation in real time using Gazebo-ROS on a Mecanum robot model is carried out which complies with the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Safe and High-Performance Learning of Model Predicitve Control using Kernel-Based Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method, which allows efficient and safe approximation of model predictive controllers using kernel interpolation. Since the computational complexity of the approximating function scales linearly with the number of data points, we propose to use a scoring function which chooses the most promising data. To further reduce the complexity of the approximation, we restrict our considerations to the set of closed-loop reachable states. That is, the approximating function only has to be accurate within this set. This makes our method especially suited for systems, where the set of initial conditions is small. In order to guarantee safety and high performance of the designed approximated controller, we use reachability analysis based on Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Renewable-Battery-Electrolyzer Facility under the Single Imbalance Pricing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: European energy markets are decentralized and entail balance responsibility of each market player. This stresses the importance of imbalance management of renewable energy sources (RES), as the imbalance payments can strongly reduce their profitability. According to the EU Electricity Balancing Guideline, each European transmission system operator should use the single imbalance pricing method which treats both deviation directions the same, no matter if a deviation helps the system or pushes it away from the balance. This paper aims to investigate the behavior of a hybrid facility consisting of an uncontrollable RES, a battery and an electrolyzer under such market setting. The formulated mathematical model of the hybrid facility seeks to maximize profit in the day-ahead energy market, while minimizing the imbalance costs. Uncertainty of the RES output is captured using stochastic scenarios, while the direction of the power system deviation, relevant for the imbalance pricing, is modeled using a newly proposed robust approach. Results of the case study indicate that the single imbalance pricing scheme might bring flexible assets to temptation of intentional deviations should they anticipate favorable imbalance prices.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Predator-Prey Age-Structured Hyperbolic PDE when Harvesting both Species is Inevitable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations do not only interact over time but also age over time. It is therefore common to model them as age-structured PDEs, where age is the space variable. Since the models also involve integrals over age, both in the birth process and in the interaction among species, they are in fact integro-partial differential equations (IPDEs) with positive states. To regulate the population densities to desired profiles, harvesting is used as input. But non-discriminating harvesting, where wanting to repress one species will inevitably repress the other species as well, the positivity restriction on the input (no insertion of population), and the multiplicative nature of harvesting, makes control challenging even for ODE versions of such dynamics, let alone for their IPDE versions on an infinite-dimensional nonnegative state space.
  We introduce a design for a benchmark version of such a problem: a two-population predator-prey setup. The model is equivalent to two coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), actuated by harvesting which must not drop below zero, and strongly disturbed by two autonomous but exponentially stable integral delay equations (IDEs). We develop two control designs. With a modified Volterra-like control Lyapunov function, we design a simple feedback which employs possibly negative harvesting for global stabilization of the ODE model, while guaranteeing regional regulation with positive harvesting. With a more sophisticated, restrained controller we achieve regulation for the ODE model globally, with positive harvesting. For the full IPDE model, with the IDE dynamics acting as large disturbances, for both the simple and saturated feedback laws we provide explicit estimates of the regions of attraction. The paper charts a new pathway for control designs for infinite-dimensional multi-species dynamics and for nonlinear positive systems with positive controls.</description>

      <title>Cooperative UAV-Relay based Satellite Aerial Ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-fifth generation (5G) era, escalating user quality of service (QoS) strains terrestrial network capacity, especially in urban areas with dynamic traffic distributions. This paper introduces a novel cooperative unmanned aerial vehicle relay-based deployment (CUD) framework in satellite air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN). The CUD strategy deploys an unmanned aerial vehicle-based relay (UAVr) in an amplify-andforward (AF) mode to enhance user QoS when terrestrial base stations fall short of network capacity. By combining low earth orbit (LEO) satellite and UAVr signals using cooperative diversity, the CUD framework enhances the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the user. Comparative evaluations against existing frameworks reveal performance improvements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the CUD framework in addressing the evolving demands of next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Structure and Control of Biology-inspired Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in developing the theoretical foundations of networked control systems that illuminate how brain networks function so as to enable sensory perception, control of movement, memory and all the operations that are needed for animals to survive. The present paper proposes a biologically inspired network model featuring dynamic connections regulated by Hebbian learning. Drawing on the machinery of graph theory and classical control we show that our novel nonlinear model exhibits such biologically plausible features as bounded evolution, stability, resilience, and a kind of structural stability -- meaning that perturbations of the model parameters leave the essential properties of the model in tact. The proposed network model involves generalized cactus graphs with multiple control input nodes, and it is shown that the properties of the network are resilient to various changes in network topology provided these changes preserve the generalized cactus structure. A particular example described in what follows is an idealized network model of the visual system of a macaque monkey. The model displays resilience to network disruptions such as might occur in a living organism due to disease or injury. A different model of the same type provides an example of a system that can perform data classification.</description>

      <title>An Improved ESO-Based Line-of-Sight Guidance Law for Path Following of Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Helicopter With Nonlinear Tracking Differentiator and Anti-saturation Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an Improved Extended-state-observer based Line-of-Sight (IELOS) guidance law for path following of underactuated Autonomous Underwater helicopter (AUH) utilizing a nonlinear tracking differentiator and anti-saturation controller. Due to the high mobility of the AUH, the classical reduced-order Extended-State-Observer (ESO) struggles to accurately track the sideslip angle, especially when rapid variation occurs. By incorporating the nonlinear tracking differentiator and anti-saturation controller, the IELOS guidance law can precisely track sideslip angle and mitigate propeller thrust buffet compared to the classical Extended-state-observer based Line-of-Sight (ELOS) guidance law. The performance of ESO is significantly influenced by the bandwidth, with the Improved Extended-State-Observer (IESO) proving effective at low bandwidths where the classical ESO falls short. The paper establishes the input-to-state stability of the closed-loop system. Subsequently, simulation and pool experimental results are showcased to validate the effectiveness of the IELOS guidance law, which outperforms both the Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Adaptive Line-of-Sight (ALOS) guidance laws in terms of performance.</description>

      <title>Non-linear Control of the Power Injected Into a Weak Grid by a Self-Synchronized Inverter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a non-linear controller designed using non-linear transformation linearization and feedback is proposed for an inverter connected to a weak grid through a single-stage inductive filter. The proposed strategy is self-synchronized, so that it is not necessary to have a voltage sensor at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC). The strategy allows to robustify, in the presence of a weak grid, a strategy that has already been demonstrated to allow a significant reduction in the size of the DC-link capacitor of the converter. For this purpose, a state observer is designed that allows estimating the voltage at the PCC from the measurement of the output inductor current. A start-up controller is also included, which allows synchronization even in the case of system start-up. Simulation results are presented for different operating cases, including start-up, normal operation, and grid-voltage sags and swells. In all these cases, it is considered that the exact parameters of the grid to which the inverter is connected are unknown.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Interpretable Control Policies through Large Language Model Guided Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The combination of Large Language Models (LLMs), systematic evaluation, and evolutionary algorithms has enabled breakthroughs in combinatorial optimization and scientific discovery. We propose to extend this powerful combination to the control of dynamical systems, generating interpretable control policies capable of complex behaviors. With our novel method, we represent control policies as programs in standard languages like Python. We evaluate candidate controllers in simulation and evolve them using a pre-trained LLM. Unlike conventional learning-based control techniques, which rely on black box neural networks to encode control policies, our approach enhances transparency and interpretability. We still take advantage of the power of large AI models, but leverage it at the policy design phase, ensuring that all system components remain interpretable and easily verifiable at runtime. Additionally, the use of standard programming languages makes it straightforward for humans to finetune or adapt the controllers based on their expertise and intuition. We illustrate our method through its application to the synthesis of an interpretable control policy for the pendulum swing-up and the ball in cup tasks. We make the code available at https://github.com/muellerlab/synthesizing_interpretable_control_policies.git</description>

Abstract: This manuscript details an architecture and training methodology for a data-driven framework aimed at detecting, identifying, and quantifying damage in the propeller blades of multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. By substituting one propeller with a damaged counterpart-encompassing three distinct damage types of varying severity-real flight data was collected. This data was then used to train a composite model, comprising both classifiers and neural networks, capable of accurately identifying the type of failure, estimating damage severity, and pinpointing the affected rotor. The data employed for this analysis was exclusively sourced from inertial measurements and control command inputs, ensuring adaptability across diverse multirotor vehicle platforms.</description>

Abstract: When the physics is wrong, physics-informed machine learning becomes physics-misinformed machine learning. A powerful black-box model should not be able to conceal misconceived physics. We propose two criteria that can be used to assert integrity that a hybrid (physics plus black-box) model: 0) the black-box model should be unable to replicate the physical model, and 1) any best-fit hybrid model has the same physical parameter as a best-fit standalone physics model. We demonstrate them for a sample nonlinear mechanical system approximated by its small-signal linearization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of long-context linear system identification, where the state $x_t$ of a dynamical system at time $t$ depends linearly on previous states $x_s$ over a fixed context window of length $p$. We establish a sample complexity bound that matches the i.i.d. parametric rate up to logarithmic factors for a broad class of systems, extending previous works that considered only first-order dependencies. Our findings reveal a learning-without-mixing phenomenon, indicating that learning long-context linear autoregressive models is not hindered by slow mixing properties potentially associated with extended context windows. Additionally, we extend these results to (i) shared low-rank representations, where rank-regularized estimators improve rates with respect to dimensionality, and (ii) misspecified context lengths in strictly stable systems, where shorter contexts offer statistical advantages.</description>

Abstract: Assessing data informativity, determining whether the measured data contains sufficient information for a specific control objective, is a fundamental challenge in data-driven control. In noisy scenarios, existing studies deal with system noise and measurement noise separately, using quadratic matrix inequalities. Moreover, the analysis of measurement noise requires restrictive assumptions on noise properties. To provide a unified framework without any restrictions, this study introduces data perturbation, a novel notion that encompasses both existing noise models. It is observed that the admissible system set with data perturbation does not meet preconditions necessary for applying the key lemma in the matrix S-procedure. Our analysis overcomes this limitation by developing an extended version of this lemma, making it applicable to data perturbation. Our results unify the existing analyses while eliminating the need for restrictive assumptions made in the measurement noise scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning to Race in Extreme Turning Scene with Active Exploration and Gaussian Process Regression-based MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme cornering in racing often induces large side-slip angles, presenting a formidable challenge in vehicle control. To tackle this issue, this paper introduces an Active Exploration with Double GPR (AEDGPR) system. The system initiates by planning a minimum-time trajectory with a Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) compensated model. The planning results show that in the cornering section, the yaw angular velocity and side-slip angle are in opposite directions, indicating that the vehicle is drifting. In response, we develop a drift controller based on Model Predictive Control (MPC) and incorporate Gaussian Process Regression to correct discrepancies in the vehicle dynamics model. Moreover, the covariance from the GPR is employed to actively explore various cornering states, aiming to minimize trajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments using a 1/10 scale RC vehicle.</description>

      <title>Characterization of input-to-output stability for infinite dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a superposition theorem for input-to-output stability (IOS) of a broad class of nonlinear infinite-dimensional systems with outputs including both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. It contains, as a special case, the superposition theorem for input-to-state stability (ISS) of infinite-dimensional systems from [1] and the IOS superposition theorem for systems of ordinary differential equations from [2]. To achieve this result, we introduce and examine several novel stability and attractivity concepts for infinite dimensional systems with outputs: We prove criteria for the uniform limit property for systems with outputs, several of which are new already for systems with full-state output, we provide superposition theorems for systems which satisfy both the output-Lagrange stability property (OL) and IOS, give a sufficient condition for OL and characterize ISS in terms of IOS and input/output-to-state stability. Finally, by means of counterexamples, we illustrate the challenges appearing on the way of extension of the superposition theorems from [1] and [2] to infinite-dimensional systems with outputs.</description>

      <title>QGym: Scalable Simulation and Benchmarking of Queuing Network Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Queuing network control determines the allocation of scarce resources to manage congestion, a fundamental problem in manufacturing, communications, and healthcare. Compared to standard RL problems, queueing problems are distinguished by unique challenges: i) a system operating in continuous time, ii) high stochasticity, and iii) long horizons over which the system can become unstable (exploding delays). To spur methodological progress tackling these challenges, we present an open-sourced queueing simulation framework, QGym, that benchmark queueing policies across realistic problem instances. Our modular framework allows the researchers to build on our initial instances, which provide a wide range of environments including parallel servers, criss-cross, tandem, and re-entrant networks, as well as a realistically calibrated hospital queuing system. QGym makes it easy to compare multiple policies, including both model-free RL methods and classical queuing policies. Our testbed complements the traditional focus on evaluating algorithms based on mathematical guarantees in idealized settings, and significantly expands the scope of empirical benchmarking in prior work. QGym code is open-sourced at https://github.com/namkoong-lab/QGym.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Augmented MPC for Disturbance-Aware Motion Planning and Control of Quadrotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge in autonomous flights is unknown disturbances, which can jeopardize safety and lead to collisions, especially in obstacle-rich environments. This paper presents a disturbance-aware motion planning and control framework designed for autonomous aerial flights. The framework is composed of two key components: a disturbance-aware motion planner and a tracking controller. The disturbance-aware motion planner consists of a predictive control scheme and a learned model of disturbances that is adapted online. The tracking controller is designed using contraction control methods to provide safety bounds on the quadrotor behaviour in the vicinity of the obstacles with respect to the disturbance-aware motion plan. Finally, the algorithm is tested in simulation scenarios with a quadrotor facing strong crosswind and ground-induced disturbances.</description>

      <title>Embedded State Estimation for Optimization of Cislunar Space Domain Awareness Constellation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traffic in cislunar space is expected to increase over the coming years, leading to a higher likelihood of conjunction events among active satellites, orbital debris, and non-cooperative satellites. This increase necessitates enhanced space domain awareness (SDA) capabilities that include state estimation for targets of interest. Both Earth surface-based and space-based observation platforms in geosynchronous orbit or below face challenges such as range, exclusion, and occlusion that hinder observation. Motivated by the need to place space-based observers in the cislunar space regime to overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a cislunar SDA constellation design and analysis framework that integrates state estimation into an optimization problem for determining the placement of observers for optimal state estimation performance on a set of targets. The proposed multi-observer placement optimization problem samples from a range of possible target orbits. Upon convergence, the optimized constellation is validated against a broader set of targets to assess its effectiveness. Two comparative analyses are presented to evaluate the effects of changes in the sensor tasking procedure and sensor fidelity on the optimized constellation, comparing these to a single observer baseline case. The results demonstrate that the optimized constellations can provide accurate state estimation for various orbit families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timing control while preserving determinism is often a key requirement for ensuring the safety and correctness of distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS). Discrete-event (DE) systems provide a suitable model of computation (MoC) for time-sensitive distributed CPS. The high-level architecture (HLA) is a useful tool for the distributed simulation of DE systems, but its techniques can be adapted for implementing distributed CPS. However, HLA incurs considerable overhead in network messages conveying timing information between the distributed nodes and the centralized run-time infrastructure (RTI). This paper gives a novel approach and implementation that reduces such network messages while preserving DE semantics. An evaluation of our runtime demonstrates that our approach significantly reduces the volume of messages for timing information in HLA.</description>

      <title>BiC-MPPI: Goal-Pursuing, Sampling-Based Bidirectional Rollout Clustering Path Integral for Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Bidirectional Clustered MPPI (BiC-MPPI) algorithm, a novel trajectory optimization method aimed at enhancing goal-directed guidance within the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) framework. BiC-MPPI incorporates bidirectional dynamics approximations and a new guide cost mechanism, improving both trajectory planning and goal-reaching performance. By leveraging forward and backward rollouts, the bidirectional approach ensures effective trajectory connections between initial and terminal states, while the guide cost helps discover dynamically feasible paths. Experimental results demonstrate that BiC-MPPI outperforms existing MPPI variants in both 2D and 3D environments, achieving higher success rates and competitive computation times across 900 simulations on a modified BARN dataset for autonomous navigation.

      <title>Two Birds With One Stone: Enhancing Communication and Sensing via Multi-Functional RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose new network architectures that integrate multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RISs) into 6G networks to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. Firstly, we elaborate how to leverage MF-RISs for improving communication performance in different communication modes including unicast, mulitcast, and broadcast and for different multi-access schemes. Next, we emphasize synergistic benefits of integrating MF-RISs with wireless sensing, enabling more accurate and efficient target detection in 6G networks. Furthermore, we present two schemes that utilize MF-RISs to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). We also study multi-objective optimization to achieve the optimal trade-off between communication and sensing performance. Finally, we present numerical results to show the performance improvements offered by MF-RISs compared to conventional RISs in ISAC. We also outline key research directions for MF-RIS under the ambition of 6G.</description>

      <title>Data-informed modeling of the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>

      <title>Constrained TLBO algorithm for lightweight cable-stiffened scissor-like deployable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Present works discusses the efficient structural analysis and weight optimization of the cable-stiffened deployable structures. The stiffening effect of cables is incorporated through a matrix analysis based iterative strategy to identify the active and passive cables. The structural form can be easily deployed to cartesian as well as polar coordinates through the arrangement of duplet members. The large span utility of cable stiffened bar members can pose challenges to the deployability due to increased weight. A novel teaching-learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is utilized to optimize the overall weight of the structure through efficient section designs with proper constraint on the yield criteria. The penalty function approach is adopted to identify the unfeasible designs. A number of example cases are analysed and comparison is presented with the existing literature to show the suitability of the proposed approach. Finally, a new form of three-dimensional deployable structure is proposed. It is seen that such deployable structure can be accurately analysed using the iterative matrix analysis approach and efficiently optimized using the present algorithm.</description>

      <title>Observability rank conditions for analysing practical identifiability a priori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of identifiability describes the possibility of inferring the parameters of a dynamic model by observing its output. It is common and useful to distinguish between structural and practical identifiability. The former property is fully determined by the model equations, while the latter is also influenced by the characteristics of the available experimental data. Structural identifiability can be determined by means of symbolic computations, which may be performed before collecting experimental data, and are hence sometimes called a priori analyses. Practical identifiability is typically assessed numerically, with methods that require simulations - and often also optimization - and are applied a posteriori. An approach to study structural local identifiability is to consider it as a particular case of observability, which is the possibility of inferring the internal state of a system from its output. Thus, both properties can be analysed jointly, by building a generalized observability matrix and computing its rank. The aim of this paper is to investigate to which extent such observability-based methods can also inform about practical identifiability. To this end, we explore a number of possible extensions of the rank tests, and discuss the purposes for which they can be informative as well as others for which they cannot.</description>

      <title>The Euler-Lagrange equation and optimal control: Preliminary results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraically speaking, linear time-invariant (LTI) systems can be considered as modules. In this framework, controllability is translated as the freeness of the system module. Optimal control mainly relies on quadratic Lagrangians and the consideration of any basis of the system module leads to an open-loop control strategy via a linear Euler-Lagrange equation. In this approach, the endpoint is easily assignable and time horizon can be chosen to minimize the criterion. The loop is closed via an intelligent controller derived from model-free control, which exhibits excellent performances concerning model mismatches and disturbances. The extension to nonlinear systems is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Robust Lateral Control of a Convoy of Autonomous &amp; Connected Vehicles with Limited Preview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.03587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lateral control of Autonomous &amp; Connected Vehicles (ACVs) convoys during Emergency Lane Change (ELC) maneuvers. These maneuvers are initiated in response to emergency cues from either the front or rear of the convoy, responding to the need to avoid obstacles or facilitate the passage of other vehicles. The primary objective of this study is to develop a lateral control scheme for ACVs based on the available information. The foundational assumption in this study is the existence of reliable connectivity among ACVs, wherein each subsequent ACV possesses information concerning the GPS position traces of both the lead and immediately preceding vehicles within the convoy. This connectivity facilitates the construction of a composite ELC trajectory that synthesizes this information, serving as a "discretized" preview of the trajectory to be tracked. The procedural steps include constructing this composite trajectory, determining cross-track error, heading, and yaw rate errors relative to it, and subsequently formulating a lateral control strategy. Furthermore, the paper presents findings on the lateral string stability of ACV convoys across various scenarios, encompassing changes in longitudinal velocity and scenarios where lead vehicle information is unavailable. Numerical and experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed lateral control scheme for ACV convoys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.13843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel direct data-driven algorithm that learns an optimal control policy for the Bilinear Biquadratic Regulator (BBR) for an unknown bilinear system. The BBR is difficult to solve owing to the presence of the nonlinear biquadratic performance index and the bilinear cross-term in the dynamics. To address these difficulties, we apply several transformations on the state decision variables to obtain a nonlinear optimization problem with a linear performance index and affine (in the parameterized control) state-dependent equality. The adroit use of the Hamiltonian and Pontryagin's Minimum Principle allows us to derive a pair of first-order necessary conditions that, at each point in time, are easily solvable linear matrix equalities (LMEs) which give the optimal state-dependent control law. We then use the marginal sample autocorrelation of the collected data to obtain a direct data-driven equivalent of these LMEs. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm via illustrative numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) achieves stability and constraint satisfaction for general nonlinear systems, but requires computationally expensive online optimization. This paper studies approximations of such MPC controllers via neural networks (NNs) to achieve fast online evaluation. We propose safety augmentation that yields deterministic guarantees for convergence and constraint satisfaction despite approximation inaccuracies. We approximate the entire input sequence of the MPC with NNs, which allows us to verify online if it is a feasible solution to the MPC problem. We replace the NN solution by a safe candidate based on standard MPC techniques whenever it is infeasible or has worse cost. Our method requires a single evaluation of the NN and forward integration of the input sequence online, which is fast to compute on resource-constrained systems. The proposed control framework is illustrated using two numerical non-linear MPC benchmarks of different complexity, demonstrating computational speedups that are orders of magnitude higher than online optimization. In the examples, we achieve deterministic safety through the safety-augmented NNs, where a naive NN implementation fails.</description>

      <title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading of Solar and Energy Storage: A Networked Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing distributed renewable and energy storage resources in local distribution networks via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading has long been touted as a solution to improve energy systems' resilience and sustainability. Consumers and prosumers (those who have energy generation resources), however, do not have the expertise to engage in repeated P2P trading, and the zero-marginal costs of renewables present challenges in determining fair market prices. To address these issues, we propose multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) frameworks to help automate consumers' bidding and management of their solar PV and energy storage resources, under a specific P2P clearing mechanism that utilizes the so-called supply-demand ratio. In addition, we show how the MARL frameworks can integrate physical network constraints to realize voltage control, hence ensuring physical feasibility of the P2P energy trading and paving way for real-world implementations.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Distributed Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization with Quantized Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new distributed nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithm that can achieve privacy protection, communication efficiency and convergence simultaneously. Specifically, each node adds general privacy noises to its local state to avoid information leakage, and then quantizes its noise-perturbed state before transmitting to improve communication efficiency. By using a subsampling method controlled through the sample-size parameter, the proposed algorithm reduces cumulative differential privacy parameters $\epsilon$, $\delta$, and thus enhances the differential privacy level, which is significantly different from the existing works. By using a two-time-scale step-sizes method, the mean square convergence for nonconvex cost functions is given. Furthermore, when the global cost function satisfies the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition, the convergence rate and the oracle complexity of the proposed algorithm are given. In addition, the proposed algorithm achieves both the mean square convergence and finite cumulative differential privacy parameters $\epsilon$, $\delta$ over infinite iterations as the sample-size goes to infinity. A numerical example of the distributed training on the ``MNIST'' dataset is given to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>A neural network-based approach to hybrid systems identification for control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a machine learning-based model of an unknown dynamical system from a finite number of (state-input)-successor state data points, such that the model obtained is also suitable for optimal control design. We adopt a neural network (NN) architecture that, once suitably trained, yields a hybrid system with continuous piecewise-affine (PWA) dynamics that is differentiable with respect to the network's parameters, thereby enabling the use of derivative-based training procedures. We show that a careful choice of our NN's weights produces a hybrid system model with structural properties that are highly favorable when used as part of a finite horizon optimal control problem (OCP). Specifically, we rely on available results to establish that optimal solutions with strong local optimality guarantees can be computed via nonlinear programming (NLP), in contrast to classical OCPs for general hybrid systems which typically require mixed-integer optimization. Besides being well-suited for optimal control design, numerical simulations illustrate that our NN-based technique enjoys very similar performance to state-of-the-art system identification methods for hybrid systems and it is competitive on nonlinear benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Path Tracking and Autonomous Drifting through Direct Yaw Moment Control and Rear-Wheel-Steering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path tracking (PT) controllers capable of replicating race driving techniques, such as drifting beyond the limits of handling, have the potential of enhancing active safety in critical conditions. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach that integrates multiple actuation methods, namely four-wheel-steering, longitudinal tyre force distribution, and direct yaw moment control, to execute drifting when this is beneficial for PT in emergency scenarios. Simulation results of challenging manoeuvres, based on an experimentally validated vehicle model, highlight the substantial PT performance improvements brought by: i) vehicle operation outside the envelope enforced by the current generation of stability controllers; and ii) the integrated control of multiple actuators.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy V2G scheduling and energy trading: A blockchain-based framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) and the deployment of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology pose significant challenges for distributed power grids, particularly in fostering trust and ensuring effective coordination among stakeholders. Establishing a trustworthy V2G operation environment is crucial for enabling large-scale EV user participation and realizing V2G potential in real-world applications. In this paper, an integrated scheduling and trading framework is developed to conduct transparent and efficacious coordination in V2G operations. In blockchain implementation, a cyber-physical blockchain architecture is proposed to enhance transaction efficiency and scalability by leveraging smart charging points (SCPs) for rapid transaction validation through a fast-path practical byzantine fault tolerance (fast-path PBFT) consensus mechanism. From the energy dispatching perspective, a game-theoretical pricing strategy is employed and smart contracts are utilized for autonomous decision-making between EVs and operators, aiming to optimize the trading process and maximize economic benefits. Numerical evaluation of blockchain consensus shows the effect of the fast-path PBFT consensus in improving systems scalability with a balanced trade-off in robustness. A case study, utilizing real-world data from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), demonstrates significant reductions in EV charging costs and the framework potential to support auxiliary grid services.</description>

      <title>The Power-Oriented Graphs Modeling Technique: From the Fundamental Principles to the Systematic, Step-by-Step Modeling of Complex Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling physical systems is an essential skill for a control engineer, since it enables to achieve a deep understanding of their dynamic behavior and, consequently, the development of effective control strategies. The first part of this article provides a tutorial description of the fundamental principles and properties of the Power-Oriented Graphs (POG) modeling technique. Various case studies in different energetic domains are then presented to consolidate the fundamental principles, each highlighting different features of the POG modeling technique. The latter is then compared with the other two main graphical modeling techniques available in the literature, namely Bond Graph (BG) and Energetic Macroscopic Representation (EMR). The second part of this article assumes once again a tutorial nature, in order to introduce the new Fast Modeling POG (FMPOG) procedure. The FMPOG, which operates in the POG framework, is a methodical step-by-step procedure that enables the readers to quickly derive the power-oriented graphical model of physical systems starting from their schematics. From the power-oriented graphical model, the state-space model can then be directly determined. To ensure the FMPOG procedure is easily usable by the entire community, we apply it to three examples in different energetic domains in this article, guiding the reader step-by-step through the derivation of the physical systems models. A freely available Matlab/Simulink program is provided in a repository, allowing the users to automatically apply the FMPOG procedure to various classes of physical systems. This program allows to convert the physical systems schematics into the corresponding POG block schemes and, ultimately, into the state-space mathematical models.</description>

      <title>Solving Reach-Avoid-Stay Problems Using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reach-Avoid-Stay (RAS) optimal control enables systems such as robots and air taxis to reach their targets, avoid obstacles, and stay near the target. However, current methods for RAS often struggle with handling complex, dynamic environments and scaling to high-dimensional systems. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based reachability analysis addresses these challenges, it has yet to tackle the RAS problem. In this paper, we propose a two-step deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method to extend RL-based reachability method to solve RAS problems. First, we train a function that characterizes the maximal robust control invariant set within the target set, where the system can safely stay, along with its corresponding policy. Second, we train a function that defines the set of states capable of safely reaching the robust control invariant set, along with its corresponding policy. We prove that this method results in the maximal robust RAS set in the absence of training errors and demonstrate that it enables RAS in complex environments, scales to high-dimensional systems, and achieves higher success rates for the RAS task compared to previous methods, validated through one simulation and two high-dimensional experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards a Deeper Understanding of Transformer for Residential Non-intrusive Load Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models have demonstrated impressive performance in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) applications in recent years. Despite their success, existing studies have not thoroughly examined the impact of various hyper-parameters on model performance, which is crucial for advancing high-performing transformer models. In this work, a comprehensive series of experiments have been conducted to analyze the influence of these hyper-parameters in the context of residential NILM. This study delves into the effects of the number of hidden dimensions in the attention layer, the number of attention layers, the number of attention heads, and the dropout ratio on transformer performance. Furthermore, the role of the masking ratio has explored in BERT-style transformer training, providing a detailed investigation into its impact on NILM tasks. Based on these experiments, the optimal hyper-parameters have been selected and used them to train a transformer model, which surpasses the performance of existing models. The experimental findings offer valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing transformer architectures, aiming to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency in NILM applications. It is expected that this work will serve as a foundation for future research and development of more robust and capable transformer models for NILM.</description>

      <title>The Brain-Inspired Cooperative Shared Control Framework for Brain-Machine Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.09531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In brain-machine interface (BMI) applications, a key challenge is the low information content and high noise level in neural signals, severely affecting stable robotic control. To address this challenge, we proposes a cooperative shared control framework based on brain-inspired intelligence, where control signals are decoded from neural activity, and the robot handles the fine control. This allows for a combination of flexible and adaptive interaction control between the robot and the brain, making intricate human-robot collaboration feasible.
  The proposed framework utilizes spiking neural networks (SNNs) for controlling robotic arm and wheel, including speed and steering. While full integration of the system remains a future goal, individual modules for robotic arm control, object tracking, and map generation have been successfully implemented. The framework is expected to significantly enhance the performance of BMI. In practical settings, the BMI with cooperative shared control, utilizing a brain-inspired algorithm, will greatly enhance the potential for clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Predictability and Fairness in Load Aggregation with Deadband</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual power plants and load aggregation are becoming increasingly common. There, one regulates the aggregate power output of an ensemble of distributed energy resources (DERs). Marecek et al. [Automatica, Volume 147, January 2023, 110743, arXiv:2110.03001] recently suggested that long-term averages of prices or incentives offered should exist and be independent of the initial states of the operators of the DER, the aggregator, and the power grid. This can be seen as predictability, which underlies fairness. Unfortunately, the existence of such averages cannot be guaranteed with many traditional regulators, including the proportional-integral (PI) regulator with or without deadband. Here, we consider the effects of losses in the alternating current model and the deadband in the controller. This yields a non-linear dynamical system (due to the non-linear losses) exhibiting discontinuities (due to the deadband). We show that Filippov invariant measures enable reasoning about predictability and fairness while considering non-linearity of the alternating-current model and deadband.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any autonomous controller will be unsafe in some situations. The ability to quantitatively identify when these unsafe situations are about to occur is crucial for drawing timely human oversight in, e.g., freight transportation applications. In this work, we demonstrate that the true criticality of an agent's situation can be robustly defined as the mean reduction in reward given some number of random actions. Proxy criticality metrics that are computable in real-time (i.e., without actually simulating the effects of random actions) can be compared to the true criticality, and we show how to leverage these proxy metrics to generate safety margins, which directly tie the consequences of potentially incorrect actions to an anticipated loss in overall performance. We evaluate our approach on learned policies from APE-X and A3C within an Atari environment, and demonstrate how safety margins decrease as agents approach failure states. The integration of safety margins into programs for monitoring deployed agents allows for the real-time identification of potentially catastrophic situations.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present detailed multipath propagation spatial statistics for next-generation wireless systems operating at lower and upper mid-band frequencies spanning 6--24 GHz. The large-scale spatial characteristics of the wireless channel include Azimuth angular Spread of Departure (ASD) and Zenith angular Spread of Departure (ZSD) of multipath components (MPC) from a transmitter and the Azimuth angular Spread of Arrival (ASA) and Zenith angular Spread of Arrival (ZSA) at a receiver. The angular statistics calculated from measurements were compared with industry-standard 3GPP models, and ASD and ASA values were found to be in close agreement at both 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz. Measured LOS ASD was found larger than 3GPP ASD indicating more diverse MPC departure directions in the azimuth. ZSA and ZSD were observed smaller than the 3GPP modeling results as most multipath arrivals and departures during measurements were recorded at the boresight antenna elevation. The wide angular spreads indicate a multipath-rich spatial propagation at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz, showing greater promise for the implementation of MIMO beamforming systems in the mid-band spectrum.</description>

Abstract: As a pivotal virtualization technology, network digital twin is expected to accurately reflect real-time status and abstract features in the on-going sixth generation (6G) networks. In this article, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-native network digital twin framework for 6G networks to enable the synergy of AI and network digital twin, thereby facilitating intelligent network management.

      <title>IC3M: In-Car Multimodal Multi-object Monitoring for Abnormal Status of Both Driver and Passengers</title>

Abstract: Recently, in-car monitoring has emerged as a promising technology for detecting early-stage abnormal status of the driver and providing timely alerts to prevent traffic accidents. Although training models with multimodal data enhances the reliability of abnormal status detection, the scarcity of labeled data and the imbalance of class distribution impede the extraction of critical abnormal state features, significantly deteriorating training performance. Furthermore, missing modalities due to environment and hardware limitations further exacerbate the challenge of abnormal status identification. More importantly, monitoring abnormal health conditions of passengers, particularly in elderly care, is of paramount importance but remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce our IC3M, an efficient camera-rotation-based multimodal framework for monitoring both driver and passengers in a car. Our IC3M comprises two key modules: an adaptive threshold pseudo-labeling strategy and a missing modality reconstruction. The former customizes pseudo-labeling thresholds for different classes based on the class distribution, generating class-balanced pseudo labels to guide model training effectively, while the latter leverages crossmodality relationships learned from limited labels to accurately recover missing modalities by distribution transferring from available modalities. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that IC3M outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in accuracy, precision, and recall while exhibiting superior robustness under limited labeled data and severe missing modality.</description>

      <title>Goal-Conditioned Terminal Value Estimation for Real-time and Multi-task Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While MPC enables nonlinear feedback control by solving an optimal control problem at each timestep, the computational burden tends to be significantly large, making it difficult to optimize a policy within the control period. To address this issue, one possible approach is to utilize terminal value learning to reduce computational costs. However, the learned value cannot be used for other tasks in situations where the task dynamically changes in the original MPC setup. In this study, we develop an MPC framework with goal-conditioned terminal value learning to achieve multitask policy optimization while reducing computational time. Furthermore, by using a hierarchical control structure that allows the upper-level trajectory planner to output appropriate goal-conditioned trajectories, we demonstrate that a robot model is able to generate diverse motions. We evaluate the proposed method on a bipedal inverted pendulum robot model and confirm that combining goal-conditioned terminal value learning with an upper-level trajectory planner enables real-time control; thus, the robot successfully tracks a target trajectory on sloped terrain.</description>
