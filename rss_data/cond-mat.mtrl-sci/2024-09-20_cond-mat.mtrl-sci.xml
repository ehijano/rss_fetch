      <title>Domain wall reactions in multiple-order parameter ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of domain walls is crucial for ferroelectric switching. Conventionally, the switching dynamics is believed to be determined by the motion of one or a few low-energy domain wall types of dominant population. Here, we challenge this conventional idea in multiple-order-parameter ferroelectrics. Using hafnia as example, we show that multiple-order-parameter nature not only provides various mobile domain walls and defect-like immobile domain walls, but also enables the domain wall reactions. In analogy with chemical reactions where substances react to form new substances, domain walls could also react to form other domain walls during switching. We identify several elementary domain wall reaction types including synthesis, decomposition, and exchange reactions. Domain walls are continually changed by these reactions during switching so that the switching behavior reflects the statistical average of many domain wall types with distinct mobility and stability. These reactions also lead to phenomenon like remnant nuclei and defect site nucleation that facilitate switching and lower coercive field. Finally, the concept of domain wall reaction is not limited to hafnia but can be generalized to any multiple-order-parameter ferroelectric. This work conceptualizes domain wall reaction, expands theory of ferroelectric switching, and suggests a practical way for defect engineering to control switching behavior.</description>

      <title>Electronic and magnetic properties of (NdNiO$_3$)/(La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$) superlattices: a DFT+U perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic and magnetic properties of NdNiO$_3$ (NNO) thin films are very sensitive to epitaxial strain and to the proximity to ferromagnetic oxides. In this work, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of NdNiO$_3$/La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$ (NNO/LSMO) superlattices under the epitaxial strain of NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) using density functional theory with Hubbard U correction (DFT+U) calculations. Our findings reveal that LSMO induces insignificant structural distortions on the NiO$_6$ octahedra, and that there is a negligible charge transfer between LSMO and NNO. More importantly, we find an intricate magnetic order regarding the interfacial Ni local moments, where we observe a coexistence of ferromagnetic interactions between interfacial Ni and Mn atoms, and antiferromagnetic interactions between inner Ni ions, which results in an overall ferromagnetic coupling across the interface. We also observe the metallization of NNO through the emergence of a half-metallic density of states in the same spin channel as LSMO, which becomes suppressed the further we move away from the interface. Our theoretical findings agrees well with recent experimental data, shedding light on the complex interplay between the induced magnetic order and the electronic properties of NNO.</description>

      <title>Best of Both Worlds: Enforcing Detailed Balance in Machine Learning Models of Transition Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The slow microstructural evolution of materials often plays a key role in determining material properties. When the unit steps of the evolution process are slow, direct simulation approaches such as molecular dynamics become prohibitive and Kinetic Monte-Carlo (kMC) algorithms, where the state-to-state evolution of the system is represented in terms of a continuous-time Markov chain, are instead frequently relied upon to efficiently predict long-time evolution. The accuracy of kMC simulations however relies on the complete and accurate knowledge of reaction pathways and corresponding kinetics. This requirement becomes extremely stringent in complex systems such as concentrated alloys where the astronomical number of local atomic configurations makes the a priori tabulation of all possible transitions impractical. Machine learning models of transition kinetics have been used to mitigate this problem by enabling the efficient on-the-fly prediction of kinetic parameters. In this study, we show how physics-informed ML architectures can exactly enforce the detailed balance condition, by construction. Using the diffusion of a vacancy in a concentrated alloy as an example, we show that such ML architectures also exhibit superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy, demonstrating that the imposition of physical constraints can facilitate the accurate learning of barriers at no increase in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Topological Surface State Evolution in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ via Surface Etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are materials with an insulating bulk interior while maintaining gapless boundary states against back scattering. Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is a prototypical topological insulator with a Dirac-cone surface state around $\Gamma$. Here, we present a controlled methodology to gradually remove Se atoms from the surface Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se quintuple layers, eventually forming bilayer-Bi on top of the quintuple bulk. Our method allows us to track the topological surface state and confirm its robustness throughout the surface modification. Importantly, we report a relocation of the topological Dirac cone in both real space and momentum space, as the top surface layer transitions from quintuple Se-Bi-Se-Bi-Se to bilayer-Bi. Additionally, charge transfer among different surface layers is identified. Our study provides a precise method to manipulate surface configurations, allowing for the fine-tuning of the topological surface states in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, which represents a significant advancement towards nano-engineering of topological states.</description>

      <title>Narrowing band gap chemically and physically: Conductive dense hydrocarbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band gap energy of an organic molecule can be reduced by intermolecular interaction enhancement, and thus, certain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are insulators with wide band gaps, are expected to undergo insulator-metal transitions by simple compression. Such a pressure-induced electronic transition can be exploited to transform non-metallic organic materials into states featuring intriguing electronic characteristics such as high-temperature superconductivity. Numerous attempts have been made to metalize various small PAHs, but so far only pressure-induced amorphization well below the megabar region was observed. The wide band gap energy of the small PAHs and low chemical stability under simple compression are the bottlenecks. We have investigated the band gap energy evolution and the crystal structural compression of the large PAH molecules, where the band gap energy is significantly reduced by increasing the number of {\pi}-electrons and improved chemical stability with fully benzenoid molecular structure. Herein, we present a pressure-induced transition in dicoronylene, C48H20, an insulator at ambient conditions that transforms into a semi-metallic state above 23.0 GPa with a three-order-of-magnitude reduction in resistivity. In-situ UV-visible absorption, transport property measurement, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations were performed to provide tentative explanations to the alterations in its electronic structure at high pressure. The discovery of an electronic transition at pressures well below the megabar is a promising step towards realization of a single component purely hydrocarbon molecular metal in the near future.</description>

      <title>Precise structure and polarization determination of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with electron ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) is a promising candidate for next generation ferroelectric memories and transistors. However, its ferroelectricity origin is still under debate due to the complex of its phase and microstructure in practical samples. In this study, we investigate the atomic structure of substrate-free HZO freestanding film with multislice electron ptychography, for which the ultra-high space resolution (up to ~25 pm) and capability to simultaneously image the cation and oxygen allow us to precisely determine the intrinsic atomic structures of different phases and reveal subtle changes among them. We clarify that the orthorhombic phase is ferroelectric with spontaneous polarization ~34{\pm}4 {\mu}C/cm2 (corresponding to 56{\pm}6 pm in displacement) that is accurately measured through statistical analysis. Significant polarization suppression is observed near the grain boundary, while no distinguishable structural changes are detected near the 180{\deg} ferroelectric domain walls. Through the direct oxygen imaging of orthorhombic phase from the [111] zone axis, we quantify a substantial number of oxygen vacancies with a preferential distribution, which influences the polarization direction and strength. These findings provide fundamentals for HZO research, and thus lay a foundation for the design of high-performance ferroelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Reward-Driven Image Segmentation in Automated Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated experiments in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) require rapid image segmentation to optimize data representation for human interpretation, decision-making, site-selective spectroscopies, and atomic manipulation. Currently, segmentation tasks are typically performed using supervised machine learning methods, which require human-labeled data and are sensitive to out-of-distribution drift effects caused by changes in resolution, sampling, or beam shape. Here, we operationalize and benchmark a recently proposed reward-driven optimization workflow for on-the fly image analysis in STEM. This unsupervised approach is much more robust, as it does not rely on human labels and is fully explainable. The explanatory feedback can help the human to verify the decision making and potentially tune the model by selecting the position along the Pareto frontier of reward functions. We establish the timing and effectiveness of this method, demonstrating its capability for real-time performance in high-throughput and dynamic automated STEM experiments. The reward driven approach allows to construct explainable robust analysis workflows and can be generalized to a broad range of image analysis tasks in electron and scanning probe microscopy and chemical imaging.</description>

      <title>Liquid Metal Oxide-assisted Integration of High-k Dielectrics and Metal Contacts for Two-Dimensional Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors are promising for future nanoelectronics. However, integrating high-k gate dielectrics for device applications is challenging as the inert van der Waals material surfaces hinder uniform dielectric growth. Here, we report a liquid metal oxide-assisted approach to integrate ultrathin, high-k HfO2 dielectric on 2D semiconductors with atomically smooth interfaces. Using this approach, we fabricated 2D WS2 top-gated transistors with subthreshold swings down to 74.5 mV/dec, gate leakage current density below 10-6 A/cm2, and negligible hysteresis. We further demonstrate a one-step van der Waals integration of contacts and dielectrics on graphene. This can offer a scalable approach toward integrating entire prefabricated device stack arrays with 2D materials. Our work provides a scalable solution to address the crucial dielectric engineering challenge for 2D semiconductors, paving the way for high-performance 2D electronics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic threshold electric field for domain wall motion in ferroelectrics based on discretized phase-field model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of ferroelectric memories, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the ferroelectric switching behaviors at small applied electric fields. In this letter, we use a discretized phase-field model to systematically investigate the intrinsic threshold electric field (TEF) to drive flat 180$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$ domain walls (DWs), and show that the results are qualitatively consistent with existing first-principle studies and experiments at cryogenic temperature. In addition, this work suggests that the activation electric field (AEF) observed in experiments at room temperature can be interpreted as the average of TEF behaviors of DWs with different curvatures, rather than explained by the traditional thermal nucleation theory. This work improves the understanding of DW motion kinetics at small applied fields, and shows that the mesh size and orientation are both important for the phase-field modeling of the above process.</description>

      <title>Magnetostatic effect on spin dynamics properties in antiferromagnetic Van der Waals material CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets are exceptional platforms for exploring the spin dynamics of antiferromagnetic materials owing to their weak interlayer exchange coupling. In this study, we examined the antiferromagnetic resonance spectra of anisotropic Van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr. In addition to the ordinary resonance modes, we observed a dipolar spin wave mode when the microwave field was oriented perpendicular to the in-plane easy axis of CrSBr. Furthermore, our results uncovered a pronounced dependency of various resonant modes on the orientation of the microwave field, which is pivotal for the accurate determination of exchange coupling constants. Numerical simulations have elucidated this orientation dependence of spin dynamics arises from the magnetostatic effect. This discovery underscores the previously underappreciated significance of dipolar interactions in shaping the dynamical properties of two-dimensional AFM materials, thereby enhancing our understanding of the intrinsic dynamic properties of vdW magnets.</description>

      <title>Modulating Anisotropic Magnetism of Layered CuCrP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ Single Crystal via Selenium Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of typical layered structures, antiferromagnetic CuCrP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ single crystal has high potential for magnetoelectric devices and spintronic multi-terminal chips due to its unique magnetic anisotropy. However, to tune the anisotropic magnetism is still challenge. Herein, high quality single crystals of CuCrP$_{2}$(S$_{1-X}$Se$_{X}$)$_{6}$ (where X=0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2) were grown via chemical vapor transport route, and the effect of selenium substitutions on the magnetic anisotropies in CuCrP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ were systematically investigated. The magnetic anisotropic results measured in normal and parallel directions between the crystallographic plane (\textbf{ab}) and the applied magnetic field (\textbf{H}) showed that the N\'eel temperatures (T$_{N}$) and temperatures at maximum magnetic susceptibilities (T$_{Max}$) in \textbf{H}$\perp$\textbf{ab} and \textbf{H}$\parallel$\textbf{ab} decreased with increasing the selenium doping amounts in CuCrP$_{2}$(S$_{1-X}$Se$_{X}$)$_{6}$ single crystals. Notably, their anisotropic behavior in paramagnetic phase tends to be isotropic with increasing selenium concentrations. Moreover, the transitions of the spin flop, which appear only in case of \textbf{H}$\perp$\textbf{ab}, was greatly suppressed with increasing the selenium concentrations in CuCrP$_{2}$(S$_{1-X}$Se$_{X}$)$_{6}$ until disappearing at X=0.1 and 0.2. The spin polarized density functional theory calculations further confirmed that the asymmetry between spin up and spin down states in CuCrP$_{2}$S$_{6}$ could be highly modulated via Se substitution, resulting in the tunable anisotropic magnetism of hybridized CuCrP$_{2}$(S$_{1-X}$Se$_{X}$)$_{6}$. Our findings make these materials to be more interesting in spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>CoF3: a g-wave Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase bridging ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, exhibits zero net magnetization due to its unique alternating spin arrangements, which cancel out macroscopic magnetization. This phase is characterized by robust time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-momentum locking, leading to distinct electronic properties advantageous for spintronic applications. In this study, we explore the possibility of altermagnetism in cobalt trifluoride (CoF3) using density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction combined with spin group theory. Our findings reveal that CoF3 exhibits zero net magnetization similar to a g-type antiferromagnet but with spin degeneracy breaking without spin-orbit coupling, akin to a ferromagnet. The optimized structure of CoF3, characterized by a rhombohedral lattice with centrosymmetric symmetry group R3c, shows significant spin splitting in both valence and conduction bands, reaching up to 45 meV. This spin splitting is attributed to the electric crystal potential and the anisotropy of the spin density, leading to the breaking of Kramers degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Increased resistance to photooxidation in Dion-Jacobson lead halide perovskites -- implication for perovskite device stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D metal halide perovskites have enabled significant stability improvements in perovskite devices, particularly in resistance to moisture. However, some 2D perovskites are even more susceptible to photooxidation compared to 3D perovskites. This is particularly true for more commonly investigated Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites that exhibit increased susceptibility to photoinduced degradation compared to Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites. Comparisons between different RP and DJ perovskites reveal that this phenomenon cannot be explained by commonly proposed differences in superoxide ion generation, interlayer distance and lattice structural rigidity differences. Instead, the resistance to photooxidation of DJ perovskites can be attributed to decreased likelihood of double deprotonation events (compared to single deprotonation events in RP perovskites) required for the loss of organic cations and the perovskite decomposition. Consequently, DJ perovskites are less susceptible to oxidative degradation (both photo- and electrochemically induced), which leads to improved operational stability of solar cells based on these materials.</description>

      <title>Influence of Ru composition deviation from stoichiometry on intrinsic spin-to-charge conversion in SrRuO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interconversion between charge and spin currents is a key phenomenon in realizing next-generation spintronic devices. Highly efficient spin-charge interconversion is expected to occur at band crossing points in materials with large spin-orbit interactions due to enhanced spin Berry curvature. On the other hand, if defects and/or impurities are present, they affect the electronic band structure, which in turn reduces the spin Berry curvature. Although defects and impurities are generally numerous in materials, their influence on the spin Berry curvature and, consequently, spin-charge interconversion has often been overlooked. In this paper, we perform spin-pumping experiments for stoichiometric SrRuO3 and non-stoichiometric SrRu0.7O3 films at 300 K, where the films are in paramagnetic states, to examine how Ru composition deviation from the stoichiometric condition influences the spin-to-charge conversion, showing that SrRuO3 has a larger spin Hall angle than SrRu0.7O3. We derive the band structures of paramagnetic SrRuO3 and SrRu0.75O3 using first-principles calculations, indicating that the spin Hall conductivity originating from the spin Berry curvature decreases when the Ru deficiency is incorporated, which agrees with the experimental results. Our results suggest that point-defect- and impurity control is essential to fully exploit the intrinsic spin Berry curvature and large spin-charge interconversion function of materials. These insights help us with material designs for efficient spin-charge interconversions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal vs Local Pseudopotentials Affect Kinetic Energy Kernels in Orbital-Free DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinetic energy (KE) kernel, which is defined as the second order functional derivative of the KE functional with respect to density, is the key ingredient to the construction of KE models for orbital free density functional theory (OFDFT) applications. For solids, the KE kernel is usually approximated using the uniform electron gas (UEG) model or the UEG-with-gap model. These kernels do not have information about the effects from the core electrons since there are no orbitals for the projection on nonlocal pseudopotentials. To illuminate this aspect, we provide a methodology for computing the KE kernel from Kohn-Sham DFT and apply it to the valence electrons in bulk aluminum (Al) with a face-centered cubic lattice and in bulk silicon (Si) in a semiconducting crystal diamond state. We find that bulk-derived local pseudopotentials provide accurate results for the KE kernel in the interstitial region. The effect of using nonlocal pseudopotentials manifests at short wavelengths, defined by the diameter of an ion surrounded by its core electrons. Specifically, we find that the utilization of nonlocal pseudopotentials leads to significant deviations in the KE kernel from the von Weizsacker result in this region, which is, as a rule, explicitly enforced in most widely used KE functional approximations for OFDFT simulations.</description>

      <title>Stiff and Deformable Quasicrystalline Architected Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low-density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in 2D and icosahedral quasicrystals in 3D, are shown to create stiff, stretching-dominated topologies with non-uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low-density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. Our results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi-periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching towards uncharted territory in the property space of architected materials.</description>

      <title>Variable Temperature and Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Measurements of High-Performance Selenium Thin-Film Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selenium is an elemental semiconductor with a wide bandgap suitable for a range of optoelectronic and solar energy conversion technologies. However, developing such applications requires an in-depth understanding of the fundamental material properties. Here, we study the properties of the majority and minority charge carriers in selenium using a recently developed carrier-resolved photo-Hall technique, which enables simultaneous mapping of the mobilities and concentrations of both carriers under varying light intensities. Additionally, we perform temperature-dependent Hall measurements to extract information about the acceptor level and ionization efficiency. Our findings are compared to results from other advanced characterization techniques, and the inconsistencies are outlined. Finally, we characterize a high-performance selenium thin-film solar cell and perform device simulations to systematically address each discrepancy and accurately reproduce experimental current-voltage and external quantum efficiency measurements. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics in selenium, which may guide future improvements and facilitate the development of higher-efficiency selenium solar cells.</description>

      <title>Chiral phononic and electronic edge modes of EuPtSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems with P2$_{1}$3 symmetry are characterized by the realization of chiral edge modes, propagating in one direction along closed loops around some high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone. We study the phononic and electronic properties of EuPtSi, which crystallizes with P2$_{1}$3 symmetry. EuPtSi is also characterized by intriguing magnetic properties, such as the realization of the skyrmion lattice. Here, using ab initio techniques, we study bulk and slab properties of EuPtSi. The bulk phononic and electronic band structures exhibit a spin-1 Weyl point and a charge-2 Dirac point at the $\Gamma$ and R points, respectively. Consequently, the surface states exhibit chiral edge modes. Such features are present in both the phononic and electronic surface spectra. The chiral phononic edge mode is associated with the vibration of the atoms in close vicinity, while the chiral electronic surface states correspond to carrier accumulation at the edge of chiral atomic chains.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Weyl node-network semimetals protected by spin symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry protected topology has been studied extensively in the past twenty years, but the topology protected by spin symmetry has just begun to be studied. In this work, based on spin symmetry analysis, we propose that a class of Weyl nodal line semimetals is protected by the spin symmetry. Then, by the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we predict that both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ are node-network semimetals protected by the spin symmetry. Moreover, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ have nodal rings protected by the mirror symmetry and Dirac points protected by nonsymmorphic spin symmetry. Furthermore, both altermagnetic $\rm Nb_2FeB_2$ and $\rm Ta_2FeB_2$ transform node-network semimetal phase into Weyl semimetal phase when considering spin-orbit coupling. Therefore, our work not only enriches the topological phases protected by spin symmetry, but also provides an excellent material platform to investigate the exotic physical properties of multiple altermagnetic topological semimetal phases in experiment.</description>

      <title>Imprinted atomic displacements drive spin-orbital order in a vanadate perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskites with the generic composition ABO$_3$ exhibit an enormous variety of quantum states such as magnetism, orbital order, ferroelectricity and superconductivity. Their flexible and comparatively simple structure allows for facile chemical substitution and cube-on-cube combination of different compounds in atomically sharp epitaxial heterostructures. However, already in the bulk, the diverse physical properties of perovskites and their anisotropy are determined by small deviations from the ideal perovskite structure, which are difficult to control. Here we show that directional imprinting of atomic displacements in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator YVO$_3$ is achieved by depositing epitaxial films on different facets of an isostructural substrate. These facets were chosen such that other control parameters, including strain and polarity mismatch with the overlayer, remain unchanged. We use polarized Raman scattering and spectral ellipsometry to detect signatures of staggered orbital and magnetic order, and demonstrate distinct spin-orbital ordering patterns on different facets. These observations can be attributed to the influence of specific octahedral rotation and cation displacement patterns, which are imprinted by the substrate facet, on the covalency of the bonds and the superexchange interactions in YVO$_3$. Well beyond established strain-engineering strategies, our results show that substrate-induced templating of lattice distortion patterns constitutes a powerful pathway for materials design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chalcogenide optical phase change materials (PCMs) have garnered significant interest for their growing applications in programmable photonics, optical analog computing, active metasurfaces, and beyond. Limited endurance or cycling lifetime is however increasingly becoming a bottleneck toward their practical deployment for these applications. To address this issue, we performed a systematic study elucidating the cycling failure mechanisms of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Se$_4$Te (GSST), a common optical PCM tailored for infrared photonic applications, in an electrothermal switching configuration commensurate with their applications in on-chip photonic devices. We further propose a set of design rules building on insights into the failure mechanisms, and successfully implemented them to boost the endurance of the GSST device to over 67,000 cycles.</description>

      <title>Theory of magnetism for rare-earth magnets on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice with non-Kramers ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the rapid experimental progress on the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets, we propose a generic effective spin model that describes interacting non-Kramers local moments on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice. We point out that the local moments consist of both magnetic dipole and quadrupole components and the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model with an intrinsic field that accounts for the crystal field splitting. We then study the ground-state phase diagram of the model and find that pure quadrupole orders, which are invisible to conventional experimental probes, can be stabilized over a broad regime. In particular, we show that a hidden ``1/3 magnetization plateau'' with quadrupole orders generally exists and discuss its experimental signatures. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results to the rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland lattice magnets Pr$_{2}$Ga$_{2}$BeO$_{7}$ and Pr$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$.</description>

      <title>Extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) with very low sheet resistance 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. By introduction the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$N interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only an order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggested the strain-induced 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was as high as 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a very low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). The finding of the very high-density 2D electron gas with very low sheet resistance in N-polar III-nitride heterostructures can push the power performance N-polar GaN HEMTs into a new level which is unreachable by the conventional N-polar GaN HEMTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance programmable silicon photonic circuits are considered to be a critical part of next generation architectures for optical processing, photonic quantum circuits and neural networks. Low-loss optical phase change materials (PCMs) offer a promising route towards non-volatile free-form control of light. Here, we exploit direct-write digital patterning of waveguides using layers of the PCM Sb$_2$Se$_3$ with a thickness of up to 100 nm, demonstrating the ability to strongly increase the effect per pixel compared to previous implementations where much thinner PCM layers were used. We exploit the excellent refractive index matching between Sb$_2$Se$_3$ and silicon to achieve a low-loss hybrid platform for programmable photonics. A five-fold reduction in modulation length of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer is achieved compared to previous work using thin-film Sb$_2$Se$_3$ devices, decreased to 5 $\mu$m in this work. Application of the thicker PCM layers in direct-write digital programming of a multimode interferometer (MMI) shows a three-fold reduction of the number of programmed pixels to below 10 pixels per device. The demonstrated scaling of performance with PCM layer thickness is important for establishing the optimum working range for hybrid silicon-PCM devices and holds promise for achieving ultracompact programmable photonic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realisation of an universal quantum computer will require the operation of thousands to millions of qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realized in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300$\,$mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2$\,\mathrm{\mu eV/\sqrt{Hz}}$, spin relaxation times of over 1$\,$s and coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2^H$ of 1$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and 50$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5$\,$MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99$\,\%$. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300$\,$mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization via Magnetic torques is one of the most important phenomena in spintronics. In thin films, conventionally, a charge current flowing in a heavy metal is used to generate transverse spin currents and to exert torques on the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic thin film layer. Here, in contrast to the typically employed heavy metals, we study spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnetic heterostructures with large spin-orbit interaction that function as the torque-generating layers. In particular, we chose perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) multilayers [Co/Ni] and [Co/Pt] as the torque-generating layers and drive magnetization dynamics in metallic ferromagnetic thin film $\mathrm{Co_{20}Fe_{60}B_{20}}$ (CoFeB) layers with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). We investigate the spin dynamics driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) and the concomitant charge current generation by the inverse SOT process using an inductive technique based on a vector network analyzer. In our experimental findings, we find that the SOTs generated by our multilayers are of a magnitude comparable to those produced by Pt, consistent with first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we noted a significant correlation between the SOT and the thickness of the CoFeB layer.</description>

Abstract: The mechanical and thermal performance of high-entropy ceramics are critical to their use in extreme conditions. However, the vast composition space of high-entropy ceramic significantly hinders their development with desired mechanical and thermal properties. Herein, taking high-entropy carbides (HECs) as the model, we show the efficiency and effectiveness of exploring the mechanical and thermal properties via machine-learning-potential-based molecular dynamics (MD). Specifically, a general neuroevolution potential (NEP) with broad compositional applicability for HECs of ten transition metal elements from group IIIB-VIB is efficiently constructed from the small dataset comprising unary and binary carbides with an equal amount of ergodic chemical compositions. Based on this well-established NEP, MD simulations on mechanical and thermal properties of different HECs have shown good agreement with the results of first-principles calculations and experimental measurements, validating the accuracy, generalization, and reliability of using the developed general NEP in investigating mechanical and thermal performance of HECs. Our work provides an efficient solution to accelerate the search for high-entropy ceramics with desirable mechanical and thermal properties.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a theoretical and computational approach to calculate the vibrational, elastic, and thermal properties of materials from the low-temperature quantum regime to the high-temperature anharmonic regime. This approach is based on anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation. It relies on second and third-order force constant tensors estimated by fitting temperature-dependent empirical potentials (TDEP) from path-integral quantum simulations with a first-principles machine learning Hamiltonian. The temperature-renormalized harmonic force constants are used to calculate the elastic moduli and the phonon modes of materials. Harmonic and anharmonic force constants are combined to solve the phonon Boltzmann transport equation to compute the lattice thermal conductivity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on bulk crystalline silicon in the temperature range from 50 to 1200~K, showing substantial improvement in the prediction of the temperature dependence of the target properties compared to experiments.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Realizable Maximum Power Factor using the Jonker and Ioffe formulation: Al-doped ZnO Triangular Microcrystals with Graphite Inclusion Case Study</title>

Abstract: Among the popular TE materials, selenides and tellurides are the benchmarks of high-efficiency systems. However, for the high-temperature application (&gt;700 K), it is required to rely on the silicides and the oxides due to their exceptional thermal stability. ZnO is among the first few oxides in the field of thermoelectricity. Al-doped ZnO is a proven material for its high-temperature thermoelectric applications. However, the high grain boundary resistance limits further improvement of the efficiency of this oxide. Band-engineering, band-modification is a successful approach in lowering the grain boundary resistance. The addition of graphite and graphite-based materials at the grain boundaries is shown to serve this purpose. In this work, graphite powder is added in varying proportions to Al-doped ZnO triangular microcrystals. Thus, prepared materials are characterized to confirm the formation and investigate the nature of interface, morphology, etc. TE parameters such as electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity of those materials also have been measured. The theoretical calculation of TE efficiency zT often differs from the actual experimental results due to the wide range of preparation methods, leading to changes in porosity, the nature and density defects, and several other factors. In this paper, an effort has been made to estimate the maximum achievable power factor (PFmax) from the measured TE parameters of this set of samples by the Jonker and Ioffe analysis. Based on the predicted PFmax, an appropriate material composition has been identified to achieve that same. Subsequently, including the measured parameters the TE efficiency (zT) is calculated. Further, a sudden dip observed in the thermal conductivity at the high-temperature range (625 K - 1000 K) of the prepared undoped ZnO graphite composite is investigated in this paper.</description>

Abstract: We present an efficient method to produce laser-triggered proton pulses well below 500 ps pulse width at keV energies. We use femtosecond photoelectron pulses emitted from a cathode to enable ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption of adsorbates on a stainless steel plate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. While direct photoionization of atoms to form well-timed ion pulses can suffer from a laser-focus-limited large starting volume, in our method the two-dimensional starting plane of the ions is defined with nanometer precision at a solid surface. We clearly outline how the method could be used in the future to efficiently produce ion beam pulses in the (sub)picosecond range for pump-probe experiments with ions.</description>

      <title>Magnomechanically controlled Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift in cavity QED</title>

Abstract: Phenomena involving interactions among magnons, phonons, and photons in cavity magnomechanical systems have attracted considerable attention recently, owing to their potential applications in the microwave frequency range. One such important effect is the response of a probe field to such tripartite interaction between photon-magnon-phonon. In this paper, we study Goos-H\"{a}nchen shift (GHS) of a reflected probe field in a cavity magnomechanical system. We consider a YIG sphere positioned within a microwave cavity. A microwave control field directly drives the magnon mode in YIG sphere, whereas the cavity is driven via a weak probe field. Our results show that the GHS can be coherently controlled through magnon-phonon coupling via the control field. For instance, GHS can be tuned from positive to negative by tuning the magnon-phonon coupling. Similarly, the effective cavity detuning is another important controlling parameter for GHS. Furthermore, we observe that the enhancement of GHS occurs when magnon-phonon coupling is weak at resonance, and when the magnon-photon coupling is approximately equal to the loss of microwave photons. Our findings may have potential significance in applications related to microwave switching and sensing.</description>

Abstract: Computational models are an essential tool for the design, characterization, and discovery of novel materials. Hard computational tasks in materials science stretch the limits of existing high-performance supercomputing centers, consuming much of their simulation, analysis, and data resources. Quantum computing, on the other hand, is an emerging technology with the potential to accelerate many of the computational tasks needed for materials science. In order to do that, the quantum technology must interact with conventional high-performance computing in several ways: approximate results validation, identification of hard problems, and synergies in quantum-centric supercomputing. In this paper, we provide a perspective on how quantum-centric supercomputing can help address critical computational problems in materials science, the challenges to face in order to solve representative use cases, and new suggested directions.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical crystalline AlN resonators with high quality factors for quantum optoelectromechanics</title>

Abstract: High-\Qm{} mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high-\Qm{} mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical resonators with \Qm{} up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained \SI{290}{\nano\meter}-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a \Qf-product approaching $10^{13}$\,\SI{}{\hertz} at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical reflectivity above 80\% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomically-thin materials based on transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene offer a promising avenue for unlocking the mechanisms underlying the spin Hall effect (SHE) in heterointerfaces. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the SHE for twisted van der Waals heterostructures that fully incorporates twisting and disorder effects, and illustrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in the generation of spin-Hall currents. We find that an accurate treatment of vertex corrections leads to a qualitatively and quantitatively different SHE than that obtained from popular approaches like the ``$i\,\eta$'' and ladder approximations. A pronounced oscillatory behavior of skew-scattering processes with twist angle, $\theta$, is predicted, reflecting a non-trivial interplay of Rashba and valley-Zeeman effects and yields a vanishing SHE for $\theta = 30^\circ$ and, for graphene-WSe$_2$, an optimal SHE for $\theta \approx 17^\circ$. Our findings reveal disorder and broken symmetries as important knobs to optimize interfacial SHEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on optical properties and dynamics of direct and spatially and momentum indirect excitons in AlGaAs/AlAs quantum wells near the crossover between $\varGamma-$ and $X$-valley confined electron states. The time-integrated photoluminescence experiment at $T=$4.8 K revealed three simultaneously observed optical transitions resulting from (a) a direct exciton recombination, involving an electron and a hole states both located in the $\varGamma$-valley in the quantum well layer, and (b) two spatially and momentum indirect excitons, comprising of the confined electron states in the $X$-valley in the AlAs barrier with different effective masses and quantum well holes in the $\varGamma$-valley. This interpretation has been based on the optical pumping density-dependent, temperature-dependent and spatially-resolved photoluminescence measurements, which provided the characterization of the structure, crucial in potential system's applications. Additionally, the time-resolved photoluminescence experiments unveiled complex carrier relaxation dynamics in the investigated quantum well system, which is strongly governed by a non-radiative carrier recombination - the characteristics further critical in potential system's use. This solid state platform hosting both direct and indirect excitons in a highly tunable monolithic system can benefit and underline the operation principles of novel electronic and photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: The emergence of strong relativistic spin-orbit effects in low-dimensional systems provides a rich opportunity for exploring unconventional states of matter. Here, we present a route to realise tunable relativistic band structures based on the lateral patterning of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling. The concept is illustrated on a patterned graphene-transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure, where the spatially periodic spin-orbit coupling induces a rich mini-band structure featuring massless and massive Dirac bands carrying large spin Berry curvature. The envisaged systems support robust and gate-tunable spin Hall responses driven by the quantum geometry of mini-bands, which can be tailored through metasurface fabrication methods and twisting effects. These findings open pathways to two-dimensional quantum material design and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

Abstract: Superlattices from twisted graphene mono- and bi-layer systems give rise to on-demand many-body states such as Mott insulators and unconventional superconductors. These phenomena are ascribed to a combination of flat bands and strong Coulomb interactions. However, a comprehensive understanding is lacking because the low-energy band structure strongly changes when the electron filling is varied. Here, we gain direct access to the filling-dependent low energy bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) by applying micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to in situ gated devices. Our findings for the two systems are in stark contrast: The doping dependent dispersion for TBG can be described in a simple model, combining a filling-dependent rigid band shift with a many-body related bandwidth change. In TDBG, on the other hand, we find a complex behaviour of the low-energy bands, combining non-monotonous bandwidth changes and tuneable gap openings. Our work establishes the extent of electric field tunability of the low energy electronic states in twisted graphene superlattices and can serve to underpin the theoretical understanding of the resulting phenomena.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we have explored the charge transfer mechanism in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) quantum dots (QDs) of molybdenum disulfide ($\rm{MoS_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\rm{WS_2}$). Rhodamine 6G (R6G), a dye from the rhodamine family, has been employed as the fluorescent molecule, with MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs acting as electron acceptors in the photo-induced charge transfer process. The TMDC QDs were synthesized using a top-down approach and characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and fluorimetry. TEM images revealed well-dispersed particles measuring 2 nm in size. These QDs exhibit strong fluorescence emission when excited with light at wavelengths below 350 nm. Under light exposure, photons generate charges in the fluorescent dye molecules, and the TMDC QDs facilitate the charge transfer process. The charge transfer phenomenon was investigated using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic technique. The time-resolved fluorescence study indicated a change in the fluorescence (FL) lifetime of R6G molecules in the presence of QDs. The FL lifetime of R6G molecules without QDs was found to be 4.0 ns, which decreased to 1.9 ns and 3.8 ns in the presence of MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs, respectively. This reduction in FL lifetime suggests that the MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs provide an additional pathway for photo-generated electrons in the excited state of R6G molecules. This research can be extended to optoelectronic devices, where charge transfer is crucial for device efficiency and performance.</description>
