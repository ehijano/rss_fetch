      <title>Automated Classification of Volcanic Earthquakes Using Transformer Encoders: Insights into Data Quality and Model Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Scaling particle-size segregation in wide-ranging sheared granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling relationships have been proposed to describe shear-driven size segregation based on intruder experiments and simulations. While these models have shown agreement with experimental and numerical results under uniform shear rate, their validity across varying shear-rate conditions remains uncertain. Here, we employ Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to investigate particle size segregation in sheared granular flows under wide-ranging shear-rate conditions. We find that the scaling between segregation velocity and local rheological conditions holds only within a moderate inertial number range ($0.01 &lt; I &lt; 0.1$), and breaks down in both quasi-static and collisional regimes. Furthermore, we show that this discrepancy leads continuum models to mispredict segregation rates in bidisperse mixtures. These findings emphasize the need for more generalized scaling laws capable of capturing segregation dynamics across a broader spectrum of shear-rate conditions and regimes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Earth's Core-Mantle boundary from nutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>Retrieving snow depth distribution by downscaling ERA5 Reanalysis with ICESat-2 laser altimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating the variability of seasonal snow cover, in particular snow depth in remote areas, poses significant challenges due to limited spatial and temporal data availability. This study uses snow depth measurements from the ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which are sparse in both space and time, and incorporates them with climate reanalysis data into a downscaling-calibration scheme to produce monthly gridded snow depth maps at microscale (10 m). Snow surface elevation measurements from ICESat-2 along profiles are compared to a digital elevation model to determine snow depth at each point. To efficiently turn sparse measurements into snow depth maps, a regression model is fitted to establish a relationship between the retrieved snow depth and the corresponding ERA5 Land snow depth. This relationship, referred to as subgrid variability, is then applied to downscale the monthly ERA5 Land snow depth data. The method can provide timeseries of monthly snow depth maps for the entire ERA5 time range (since 1950). The validation of downscaled snow depth data was performed at an intermediate scale (100 m x 500 m) using datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in the Hardangervidda region of southern Norway. Results show that snow depth prediction achieved R2 values ranging from 0.74 to 0.88 (post-calibration). The method relies on globally available data and is applicable to other snow regions above the treeline. Though requiring area-specific calibration, our approach has the potential to provide snow depth maps in areas where no such data exist and can be used to extrapolate existing snow surveys in time and over larger areas. With this, it can offer valuable input data for hydrological, ecological or permafrost modeling tasks.</description>
