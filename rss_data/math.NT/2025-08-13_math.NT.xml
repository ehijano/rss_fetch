      <title>Constrained PSLQ Search for Machin-like Identities Achieving Record-Low Lehmer Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$, with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable. Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures ($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations.</description>

      <title>Conjectures about Primes and Cyclic Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A positive integer $n$ is defined to be cyclic if and only if every group of size $n$ is cyclic. Equivalently, $n$ is cyclic if and only if $n$ is relatively prime to the number of positive integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. Because every prime number is cyclic, it is natural to ask whether a (proved or conjectured) property of primes extends to cyclic numbers. I review proved or conjectured properties of primes (including some new conjectures about primes) and propose analogous conjectures about cyclic numbers. Using the 28,488,167 cyclic numbers less than $10^8$, I test the conjectures about cyclic numbers and disprove the cyclic analog of the second conjecture about primes of Hardy and Littlewood. Proofs or disproofs of the remaining conjectures are invited.</description>

      <title>Local Factorization of p-adic Gamma Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the proposed equality between discrete Fourier transforms of $p$-adic $\Gamma_p$--values and $p$-adic $L$--derivatives for odd characters modulo a prime $p$. The clean identity is false in general. Building on Coleman reciprocity and the Gross--Koblitz formula, we prove an exact two-term decomposition: for each odd, nontrivial Dirichlet character $\chi \pmod p$, \[ \Phi_p (\chi):=\sum_{a=1}^{p-1}\chi(a)\,\log_p \Gamma_p \!\left(\frac{a}{p-1}\right) = U_{1,p}\,L'_p(0,\chi)\;+\;U_{2,p}\,L(0,\chi), \] with constants $U_{1,p}\in\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p-1})^\times$ and $U_{2,p}\in\mathbb{Q}_p(\mu_{p-1})$ depending only on $p$ and the fixed branch of $\log_p$, but independent of $\chi$. Subtracting the $L(0,\chi)$--block yields a \emph{renormalized} local input \[ \Phi^{ren}_p(\chi):=\Phi_p(\chi)-U_{2,p}L(0,\chi)=U_{1,p}\,L'_p(0,\chi), \] uniformly in odd, nontrivial $\chi$. Plumbing these renormalized locals at every finite place into the Weil explicit formula (with the standard Li kernel at $\infty$) reproduces exactly the classical Li coefficients. We also record a short, reproducible verification protocol; a tiny table for $p=5,7$ illustrates the $\chi$--independence of $(U_{1,p},U_{2,p})$.</description>

      <title>Wieferich primes in number fields and the conjectures of Ankeny--Artin--Chowla and Mordell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a prime $p\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{4})$, let \[ \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left( t + u\sqrt{p}\right) \] be the fundamental unit of the real quadratic field $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$. In 1951, N. Ankeny, E. Artin, and S. Chowla asked whether $p$ can divide $u$. They suggested that this can never happen and this has since been called the Ankeny--Artin--Chowla (AAC) conjecture.
  We show that if $\mathfrak{p}$ is the prime above $p$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{p})$, then the AAC conjecture is false if and only if \[ \varepsilon^{p-1} \equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). \] Thus, the AAC conjecture is related to the existence of number field analogues of Wieferich primes. Therefore, in the second part of this paper, we investigate the infinitude of Wieferich primes in number fields. Subject to Masser's $abc$-conjecture for number fields, we prove that for any fixed $\alpha\in \mathcal{O}_K\setminus\{0\}$ that is not a root of unity, there are infinitely many primes ideals $\mathfrak{p}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ for which \[ \alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1} \not\equiv 1\, (\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2}). \] Additionally, we show under the weaker assumption that there are finitely many base-$\alpha$ super-Wieferich primes, and that there are infinitely many base-$\alpha$ non-Wieferich primes. In both cases, we obtain the lower bound
  \[ \#\left\{\text{prime ideals } \mathfrak{p} : N(\mathfrak{p})\leq x \text{ and } \alpha^{N(\mathfrak{p})-1}\not\equiv 1 \,(\bmod{\mathfrak{p}^2})\right\} \gg_{K, \alpha, \varepsilon} \frac{\log x}{\log\log x} \]
  as $x\to \infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the smoothed counts of $S_4$-quartic fields with bounded discriminant, satisfying any finite specified set of local conditions, as the sum of two main terms with a power saving error term. We also prove an analogous result for quartic rings (weighted by the number of cubic resolvents), deducing as a consequence that the Shintani zeta functions associated to the prehomogeneous vector space $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathrm{Sym}^2(\mathbb{C}^3)$ have at most a simple pole at $s=5/6$.</description>

      <title>Periodicity and Dynamical Systems of Dickson Polynomials in Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical properties of Dickson polynomials over finite fields, focusing on the periodicity and structural behavior of their iterated sequences. We introduce and analyze the sequence \( [D_n(x, \alpha) \mod (x^q - x)]_n \), where \( D_n(x, \alpha) \) denotes a Dickson polynomial of the first kind, and explore its periodic nature when reduced modulo \( x^q - x \). We derive explicit formulas for the period of these sequences, particularly in the case when \( n \) is coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). In addition, we identify a symmetric property of the polynomial coefficients that plays a crucial role in the analysis of these sequences. Using tools from combinatorics, elementary number theory, and finite fields, we present algorithms to compute the exact period and investigate the dynamical structure of these polynomials. We also highlight open problems in cases where the degree \( n \) is not coprime to \( q^2 - 1 \). Our results offer deep insights into the algebraic structure of Dickson polynomials and their role in dynamical systems over finite fields.</description>

      <title>Torsion of rank-two $A$-motives values in odd characteristic cyclotomic towers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08692v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For rank-two $A$-motives defined over local fields with odd characteristic, we give an analogue of a theorem of Imai stating that abelian varieties with good reduction over $p$-adic fields have only finitely many torsion points values in cyclotomic towers. This implies the finiteness of torsion points of abelian Anderson $A$-modules. For rank-two Drinfeld $A$-modules over global function fields, we also give an analogue of a theorem of Ribet on torsion points of abelian varieties values in maximal cyclotomic extensions of number fields.</description>

      <title>Generating random factorisations of polynomial values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct algorithms that efficiently generate random factorisations of values $P(n)$ as products of two integers, where $P\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a given quadratic or cubic monic polynomial. In other words, the algorithms produce random triples $(n,d_1,d_2)\in\mathbb{Z}^3$ that solve the Diophantine equation $P(n) = d_1d_2$. In the case where $P$ is cubic, such an algorithm allows the construction of an RSA key of $k$ bits that can be described using about $k/3$ bits of information. We also show how to construct a solution $(n,d_1,d_2)$ with the ratio $d_1/d_2$ arbitrarily close to any given positive real number. This proves that among all solutions $(n,d_1,d_2)$ of $P(n) = d_1d_2$ the ratios $d_1/d_2$ are dense in $(0,+\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Unconditional results for Artin-type problems over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field and let $G$ be a finitely generated subgroup of $K^\times$. For all but finitely many primes $\mathfrak p$ of $K$, the reduction $(G \bmod \mathfrak p)$ generates a well-defined subgroup of the multiplicative group of the residue field at $\mathfrak p$, and we may consider its index. We study the primes of $K$ for which this index lies in a given set of positive integers $S$. In particular, we prove that under certain convergence conditions on series associated to $S$ this problem can be addressed without assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and we provide asymptotic formulas for the corresponding prime-counting functions. Problems of this type are related to Artin's primitive root conjecture, which has been proven under the assumption of GRH (Hooley, 1967).</description>

Abstract: We construct Rankin-Selberg integrals using Bessel models for a product of tensor product partial $L$-functions \begin{equation*} L^S(s,\pi\times\tau_1) L^S(s,\pi\times\tau_2)\cdots L^S(s,\pi\times\tau_r) \end{equation*} where $\pi$ is an irreducible cuspidal automorphic representation of a quasi-split $\mathrm{GSpin}$ group, and $\tau_1, \cdots, \tau_r$ are irreducible unitary cuspidal automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_{k_1}, \cdots, \mathrm{GL}_{k_r}$ respectively. As an application, we prove one direction of the global Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture for generic representations of quasi-split $\mathrm{GSpin}$ groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a variety of finiteness questions for preperiodic points of morphisms. We begin by treating a group action analog of the Burnside problem for torsion groups using the p-adic arc method. We then prove some results connecting commonality of preperiodic points for elements of an automorphism group with structural properties of the group; these results are related to well-known results of Tits and Borel. We finish by proving some Northcott-type results for finite morphisms.</description>

      <title>On $q$-real and $q$-complex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:1812.00170, S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko introduced the notion of the $q$-rational number $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb Q$, a rational function specializing to $x$ at $q=1$, obtained by $q$-deforming the continued fraction expansion of $x$. In arXiv:1908.04365 they introduced $q$-real numbers $[x]_q$, $x\in \Bbb R$ - a Laurent series in $q$ converging to the rational function $[x]_q$ when $x\in \Bbb Q$. In arXiv:2102.00891 it is proved that if $x\in \Bbb Q_{&gt;1}$ then the series $[x]_q$ converges for $|q|&lt;3-2\sqrt{2}\approx 0.17$ and conjectured that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{&gt;1}$ this series converges in some disk centered in the origin, with the expected common radius of convergence $R_*=\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2}\approx 0.38$, achieved when $x=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ is the golden ratio. This was proved for rational $x$ in arXiv:2405.15970 using the theory of Kleinian groups. In this paper we (partially) prove this conjecture by showing that for all $x\in \Bbb R_{&gt;1}$, the series $[x]_q$ converges in the disk $|q|&lt;3-2\sqrt{2}$ to a nonvanishing holomorphic function. This is achieved by giving an expansion of $1/[x]_q$ into a $q$-adically convergent series of rational functions converging absolutely and uniformly on compact sets in an explicit region $D$ containing this disk. We also show that this expansion converges to a positive analytic function on the interval $(-\frac{3-\sqrt{5}}{2},1)$, giving a definition of $[x]_q$ for $q$ from this interval. Moreover, we show that the result of arXiv:2405.15970 implies convergence of $[x]_q$ for $|q|&lt;2-\sqrt{3}\approx 0.27$. We also give examples of explicit computation of $[x]_q$ for transcendental numbers $x$, e.g. $x={\rm cotan}(1)$. Finally, we propose a definition of the $q$-complex number $[\tau]_q$, a meromorphic function of $\tau\in \Bbb C_+$ which expresses via hypergeometric functions of modular functions of $\tau$.</description>

      <title>The Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda conjecture on formal degrees for classical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda relating formal degrees of square-integrable representations to adjoint gamma factors for symplectic and even orthogonal groups over characteristic zero non-Archimedean local fields. The proof is based on the twisted endoscopic characterization of the local Langlands correspondence for such groups and extends an approach already appearing in the original paper of Hiraga-Ichino-Ikeda itself inspired from earlier work of Shahidi. Namely, the argument consists in computing in two different ways a residue of certain standard intertwining operators suitably extended to a large representation realized on an explicit space of functions. This gives rise to the spectral decomposition of certain singular twisted orbital integrals. The main theorem follows from a comparison of this identity with the Plancherel formula of a symplectic or even orthogonal group. The proof can be adapted to deal with other classical groups, namely odd orthogonal and unitary groups, but the formal degree conjecture was already established in these cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenvectors of the $(N+1)\times (N+1)$ symmetric Pascal matrix $T_N$ are analogs of prolate spheroidal wave functions in the discrete setting. The generating functions of the eigenvectors of $T_N$ are prolate spheroidal functions in the sense that they are simultaneously eigenfunctions of a third-order differential operator and an integral operator over the critical line $\{z\in\mathbb{C}: \text{Re}(z) = 1/2\}$. For even, positive integers $N$, we obtain an explicit formula for the generating function of an eigenvector of the symmetric pascal matrix with eigenvalue $1$. In the special case when $N=p-1$ for an odd prime $p$, we show that the generating function is equivalent modulo $p$ to $(\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)-1)^2$, where $\# E_z(\mathbb F_p)$ is the number of points on the Legendre elliptic curve $y^2 = x(x-1)(x-z)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Whittaker models beyond $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of generalized Whittaker models by allowing them to be built upon smooth irreducible representations of unipotent subgroups of a $p$-adic reductive group that are not necessarily characters, nor induced from Weil representations. This notion generalizes the usual notion of generalized Whittaker models, which include the Bessel and Fourier--Jacobi models. Using Kirillov's orbit method for unipotent groups, we define and prove basic properties of the corresponding Jacquet functors. We also provide new instances of generalized Whittaker models of multiplicity one.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Geometry and Geometric Class Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an upgrade of Deligne's geometric class field theory for tamely ramified Galois groups using logarithmic geometry. In particular, we define a framed logarithmic Picard space, and show that a logarithmic compactification of the classical tamely ramified Div-to-Pic map has, for sufficiently large degree, log simply connected fibers given by loagrithmically compactified vector spaces. This provides a canonical bijection between local systems on the curve with divisorial log structure and multiplicative local systems on the framed logarithmic Picard (a logarithmic version of the Hecke eigensheaf correspondence of Geometric Langlands for GL_1. We use this to re-derive tamely ramified global Artin reciprocity for function fields, and show that logarithmic geometry allows for a geometric interpretation of local-to-global compatibility at all places (in addition to the unramified places).</description>

      <title>Khintchine dichotomy and Schmidt estimates for self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the classical theorems of Khintchine and Schmidt in metric Diophantine approximation to the context of self-similar measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$. For this, we establish effective equidistribution of associated random walks on $\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{d+1}(\mathbb{Z})$.
  This generalizes our previous work which requires $d=1$ and restricts Schmidt-type counting estimates to approximation functions which decay fast enough.
  Novel techniques include a bootstrap scheme for the associated random walks despite algebraic obstructions, and a refined treatment of Dani's correspondence. We also establish non-concentration properties of self-similar measures near algebraic subvarieties of $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.08613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new probabilistic model of the primes consisting of integers that survive the sieving process when a random residue class is selected for every prime modulus below a specific bound. From a rigorous analysis of this model, we obtain heuristic upper and lower bounds for the size of the largest prime gap in the interval $[1,x]$. Our results are stated in terms of the extremal bounds in the interval sieve problem. The same methods also allow us to rigorously relate the validity of the Hardy-Littlewood conjectures for an arbitrary set (such as the actual primes) to lower bounds for the largest gaps within that set.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the mutual energy (or the intersection product in the sense of Arakelov theory) of two dynamical systems associated to Latt\`es morphisms over $\mathbf{\bar Q}$ is uniformly bounded below and deduce a proof of a conjecture of Bogomolov-Fu-Tschinkel: the number of common images of torsion points of two non-isomorphic elliptic curves over $\mathbf{C}$ by a standard morphism to the projective line is uniformly bounded. The proof crucially relies on the theory of Berkovich spaces over $\mathbf{Z}$ and on an original argument allowing to obtain a global estimate from a central estimate (over a trivially valued field).</description>

      <title>On the Density of Low Lying Zeros of a Large Family of Automorphic $L$-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), Baluyot, Chandee, and Li nearly doubled the range in which the density of low lying zeros predicted by Katz and Sarnak is known to hold for a large family of automorphic $L$-functions with orthogonal symmetry. We generalize their main techniques to the study of higher centered moments of the one-level density of this family, leading to better results on the behavior near the central point. Numerous technical obstructions emerge that are not present in the one-level density. Averaging over the level of the forms and assuming GRH, we prove the density predicted by Katz and Sarnak holds for the $n$-th centered moments for test functions whose Fourier transform is compactly supported in $(-\sigma, \sigma)$ for $\sigma~=~\min\left\{3/2(n-1), 4/(2n-\mathbf{1}_{2\nmid n})\right\}$. For $n=3$, our results improve the previously best known $\sigma=2/3$ to $\sigma=3/4$. We also prove the two-level density agrees with the Katz-Sarnak density conjecture for test functions whose Fourier transform is compactly supported in $\sigma_1 = 3/2$ and $\sigma_2 = 5/6$, respectively, extending the previous best known sum of supports $\sigma_1 + \sigma_2 = 2$. This work is the first evidence of an interesting new phenomenon: by taking different test functions, we are able to extend the range in which the Katz-Sarnak density predictions hold. The techniques we develop can be applied to understanding quantities related to this family containing sums over multiple primes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the smoothed counting function of the set of quartic fields, satisfying any finite set of local conditions, can be written as a linear combination of $X,X^{5/6}\log X,X^{5/6}$, upto an error term of $O(X^{13/16+o(1)})$. For certain sets of local conditions, namely, those cutting out ``$S_4$-families'' of quartic fields, we explicitly determine the leading constants of the secondary terms. We moreover express these constants in terms of secondary mass formulas associated to families of quartic fields</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23177v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding positive integers $n$ such that all the decimal digits of $2^n$ are even, i.e., belong to $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$. Computational checks up to $n = 10^{15}$ reveal the known cases $n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 11$ and no additional instances. We present a self-contained argument, based on a dynamical Borel-Cantelli lemma, that establishes a metric result related to this problem. We show that the set of "initial phases" in a corresponding dynamical system that would generate infinitely many such powers is of Lebesgue measure zero, providing strong probabilistic support for the finiteness conjecture.</description>

      <title>Some Bounds Related to the $2$-adic Littlewood Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every irrational real $\alpha$, let $M(\alpha) = \sup_{n\geq 1} a_n(\alpha)$ denote the largest partial quotient in its continued fraction expansion (or $\infty$, if unbounded). The $2$-adic Littlewood conjecture (2LC) can be stated as follows: There exists no irrational $\alpha$ such that $M(2^k \alpha)$ is uniformly bounded by a constant $C$ for all $k\geq 0$. In 2016, Badziahin proved (considering a different formulation of 2LC) that if a counterexample exists, then the bound $C$ is at least $8$. We improve this bound to $15$. Then we focus on a ``B-variant'' of 2LC, where we replace $M(\alpha)$ by $B(\alpha) = \limsup_{n\to \infty} a_n(\alpha)$. In this setting, we prove that if $B(2^k \alpha) \leq C$ for all $k\geq 0$, then $C \geq 5$. For the proof we use Hurwitz's algorithm for multiplication of continued fractions by 2. Along the way, we find families of quadratic irrationals $\alpha$ with the property that for arbitrarily large $K$ there exist $\beta, 2\beta, 4 \beta, \ldots, 2^K \beta$ all equivalent to $\alpha$.</description>

Abstract: Consider a Berkovich space over a good Banach ring and the relative projective line over it. (It is a space whose fibers are projective lines over different complete valued fields.) For each polarized endomorphism of this line, we prove that the family of equilibrium measures associated to the restrictions of the endomorphism to the fibers is continuous. The result holds, in particular, when the Banach ring is a complete valued field, a hybrid field, a complete discrete valuation ring, or the ring of integers of a number field.</description>

      <title>Derived Satake morphisms for $p$-small weights in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite unramified extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_F$, and let $\mathbf{G}$ denote a split, connected reductive group over $\mathcal{O}_F$. We fix a Borel subgroup $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{T}\mathbf{U}$ with maximal torus $\mathbf{T}$ and unipotent radical $\mathbf{U}$, and let $L(\lambda)$ denote an irreducible representation of $G_0 := \mathbf{G}(\mathcal{O}_F)$ with coefficients in a sufficiently large field of characteristic $p$. Set $G := \mathbf{G}(F)$, etc.
  Assuming $\lambda$ is a $p$-small and sufficiently regular character and that $p - 1$ is greater than the Coxeter number of $\mathbf{G}$, we show that the complex $L(U,\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)))$ splits as the orthogonal direct sum of its cohomology objects in the derived category of smooth $T$-representations in characteristic $p$. (Here $L(U, -)$ denotes Heyer's left adjoint of parabolic induction, from the derived category of smooth $G$-representations to the derived category of smooth $T$-representations.) Consequently, this gives rise to a collection of morphisms of graded spherical Hecke algebras $$\displaystyle{\bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{G}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda)),~\textrm{c-ind}_{G_0}^{G}(L(\lambda))\right) \longrightarrow \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}\textrm{Ext}_{T}^{i}\left(\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda))),~\textrm{c-ind}_{T_0}^{T}(L^n(U_0,L(\lambda)))\right)}$$ indexed by $n=-[F:\mathbb{Q}_p]\dim(\mathbf{U}), \ldots, 0$, which we refer to as derived Satake morphisms. For $\lambda=0$ and $n=0$, this recovers the graded mod $p$ Satake homomorphism constructed by Ronchetti.
  We also give some partial results for general standard parabolic subgroups $\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{M}\mathbf{N} \subset \mathbf{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an algebraic variety over $\mathbf{C}$. We define a canonical compactification $X^{\!\urcorner}$ of the complex analytic space $X(\mathbf{C})$ by adding a Berkovich space over a trivially valued field at the boundary. The construction is functorial with respect to proper morphisms and preserves many properties, such as normality, regularity, etc. We prove a partial GAGA theorem in this setting : there is an equivalence between the categories of coherent sheaves on $X$ and $X^{\!\urcorner}$, and it induces bijections on global sections. The results still hold if $\mathbf{C}$ is replaced by a complete non-trivially valued field $k$, and complex analytic spaces by Berkovich analytic spaces over $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>An identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers with arithmetic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a combinatorial identity relating Catalan numbers to tangent numbers arising from the study of peak algebra that was conjectured by Aliniaeifard and Li. This identity leads to the discovery of the intriguing identity $$ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}{2n\choose 2k+1}2^{2n-2k}(-1)^{k}E_{2k+1}=2^{2n+1}, $$ where $E_{2k+1}$ denote the tangent numbers. Interestingly, the latter identity can be applied to prove that $(n + 1)E_{2n+1}$ is divisible by $2^{2n}$ and the quotient is an odd number, a fact whose traditional proofs require significant calculations. Moreover, we find a natural $q$-analog of the latter identity with a combinatorial proof. This $q$-identity can be applied to prove Foata's divisibility property of the $q$-tangent numbers, which responds to a problem raised by Sch\"utzenberger.</description>
