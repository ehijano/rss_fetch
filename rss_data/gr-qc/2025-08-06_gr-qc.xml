      <title>Observing an accretion disk inside a wormhole shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper considers the problem of the possibility of observing an accretion disk through the throat of the Ellis-Bronnikov-Morris-Thorne wormhole. It is shown that this image has a complex structure and is fundamentally different from the image of an accretion disk around a black hole. Images of the accretion disk are presented at various angles between the plane of the disk and the observer's line of sight.</description>

      <title>Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a tensor gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background in a calculable manner, for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponent Approach to Phase Structure of Schwarzschild AdS Black Holes Surrounded by a Cloud of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Schwarzschild black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes surrounded by a cloud of strings (BH-AdS-CoS), incorporating both electric- and magnetic-like components of the string bi-vector. Thermodynamically, these systems exhibit small/intermediate/large black hole phases with first- and second-order transitions governed by the string parameter $c_0$. Dynamically, we probe the phase structure using Lyapunov exponents $\lambda$ from unstable circular geodesics. For massless particles ($\delta = 0$), analytical expressions $\lambda$ reveal multivalued behavior in first-order transition regimes ($c_0 &lt; c_{\text{cri}}$), with branches mapping to thermodynamic phases ($\lambda_{\text{SBH}}, \lambda_{\text{IBH}}, \lambda_{\text{LBH}}$). The discontinuity $\Delta\lambda = \lambda_{\text{SBH}} - \lambda_{\text{LBH}}$ at $T_p$ follows mean-field scaling: $\Delta\lambda / \lambda_{\text{cri}} \propto (T_\text{cri} - T)^{1/2} \quad (\beta = 1/2)$. For massive particles ($\delta = 1$), numerical computation of timelike geodesics confirms $\lambda$ as an order parameter, with critical exponent $\beta = 1/2$ universally. Key distinctions emerge: $\lambda\to 1$ asymptotically for photons, while $\lambda\to 0$ in the significant black hole phase for massive particles due to vanishing unstable orbits. The transition of $\lambda$ from multivalued to single-valued at $c_0 = c_{\text{cri}}$ establishes it as a universal dynamical probe of black hole criticality. The universal critical exponent of 1/2 for \(\Delta\lambda\) further reinforces the analogy with conventional thermodynamic systems. Our results confirm a direct connection between the thermodynamic phase structure of BH-AdS-CoS and the dynamics of test particles, with the Lyapunov exponent emerging as a sensitive diagnostic of black hole criticality.</description>

      <title>Traversable Kaluza-Klein wormholes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various authors have suggested that Kaluza--Klein variants of traversable wormholes might to some extent ameliorate the defocussing properties (the curvature condition violations, and implied energy condition violations) inherent in positing the existence of a traversable wormhole throat. We shall show that in a Kaluza--Klein context the price paid for completely eliminating the defocussing properties of the wormhole throat is extremely high -- the 5th dimension has to become truly enormous (formally infinite) in the vicinity of the wormhole throat, in a manner that is fundamentally incompatible with the traditional Kaluza--Klein ansatz. While traversable Kaluza--Klein wormholes might be interesting for other reasons, it must be emphasized that adding a 5th dimension is not particularly useful in terms of ameliorating violations of the curvature conditions.</description>

      <title>Optical Characteristics of the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black hole, a theoretical model of a rotating black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field, has been proposed recently by Podolsky and Ovcharenko. This study investigates the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole based on the exact solution. We analyze the optical image under two illumination models: a celestial light source and a geometrically thin accretion disk. We reveal distinct roles for the fundamental parameters in the model. Specifically, it is found that under both illumination models, the effect of the rotation parameter on the optical image of the Kerr-BR black hole is significantly different from that of the magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, the radii of both the shadow and the Einstein ring enlarge. We also attempt to use the data from M87* and Sgr A* to constrain the magnetic field. These results enhance our understanding of the optical characteristics of the Kerr-BR black hole and establish a theoretical foundation for interpreting future observations on the optical image of the black hole immersed in a uniform magnetic field. Finally, we point out that with advances in the resolution of black hole images, it is possible to detect potential BR-like magnetic fields around black holes.</description>

      <title>On the viability of minimal Ho\v{r}ava gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava gravity is a Lorentz-violating modification of general relativity (GR) with a preferred spacelike foliation. Observational evidence has put strong constraints on the parameter values in this model, so that the remaining viable sector is well-characterized by the Newton constant and a single additional parameter. We analyze this restricted theory, which is called minimal Ho\v{r}ava gravity ($\mathrm{mHg}$), from the Hamiltonian point of view. We find that in order to eliminate a pathological mode that is unstable at high frequencies and strongly coupled at low frequencies the theory must be further restricted so that the slices of the preferred foliation each have constant mean curvature. We dub this theory "minimal minimal Ho\v{r}ava gravity" ($\mathrm{m^2Hg}$). It has two regimes; one in which the mean curvature is time independent, in which case it is equivalent to a particular foliation of GR with nonzero cosmological constant, and another in which the mean curvature is time dependent. In the latter there is an infinite propagation speed since the lapse evolves via an elliptic equation, and the theory thus differs from GR in a peculiar nonlocal fashion. To probe the viability of the sector with time dependent mean curvature, we study in detail the problem of spherical collapse of a thin dust shell. The solution is determined unambiguously from initial conditions until the slice on which the shell first contracts to a point. Afterwards, there is an instantaneously propagating spherical mode with undetermined evolution, demonstrating a failure of the Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>Probing the Weak Gravity Conjecture: Novel Aschenbach Signatures in Superextremal Non-Linear Charged AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the nonlinear charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole solution within the framework of massive gravity, motivated by recent advancements linking the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC) to phenomena such as Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) and photon sphere dynamics. Building on these foundations, we focus on the Aschenbach effect-a relativistic phenomenon intricately tied to the geometry of photon spheres and known to occur in some special sub-extremal non rotating black holes. Our primary objective is to determine whether this effect persists not only up to the extremal limit but also beyond, into the superextremal regime, thus probing the stability and validity of black hole characteristics in these extreme conditions. By analyzing the nonlinear charged AdS black hole solutions in massive gravity, we demonstrate that the Aschenbach effect remains a robust feature across both extremal and superextremal configurations. This extension suggests that key relativistic signatures and the underlying spacetime structures associated with high-spin black holes continue to hold beyond classical boundaries. Our results provide new insights into the behavior of ultra-compact objects and highlight promising directions for exploring the limits of general relativity, as well as potential generalizations of the WGC and WCC in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder Black Hole with Quintessential Dark Energy and a String Clouds: Geodesics, Perturbative Dynamics, and Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a deformed Schwarzschild black hole (BH) within a loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework incorporating both a quintessence field (QF) and a cloud of strings (CS), aiming to understand how these exotic fields collectively influence various physical phenomena in the BH's vicinity. We systematically investigate the quantum Oppenheimer--Snyder (QOS) spacetime by deriving the complete metric and analyzing horizon structures, showing significant modifications to the classical geometry through the interplay of quantum deformation effects, CS, and QF parameters. Our comprehensive geodesic analysis demonstrates that null geodesics exhibit modified effective potentials and altered photon trajectories, while timelike geodesics show enhanced orbital velocities and geodesic precession frequencies compared to classical predictions, providing potentially observable signatures through precision measurements. The BH shadow investigation reveals systematic increases in shadow radius with both CS and QF parameters, offering new possibilities for testing exotic matter configurations through next-generation high-resolution observations. We examine field perturbations of different spins -- including scalar, electromagnetic (EM), and fermionic fields -- demonstrating that the BH remains stable under external disturbances while exhibiting modified quasinormal mode (QNM) spectra that could serve as observational discriminators. Most remarkably, our thermodynamic analysis reveals exotic thermal behavior including negative temperature regimes, fundamentally altered stability conditions, and genuine phase transitions between distinct BH configurations, extending well beyond classical general relativity predictions.</description>

      <title>Particle Dynamics and Thermal Properties in Kalb-Ramond ModMax Black Holes: Theoretical Predictions for Observational Tests of Exotic Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of geodesic motion and thermodynamic behavior in Kalb--Ramond (KR) black hole (BH) spacetimes sourced by ModMax electrodynamics. Both neutral and charged test particle dynamics are investigated, highlighting how the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $\ell$, the ModMax nonlinearity parameter $\gamma$, and the discrete branch parameter $\zeta$ significantly modify orbital structures compared to classical Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) solutions. Effective potential analysis reveals notable shifts in the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO): ordinary branches allow stable orbits closer to the horizon, while phantom branches shift them outward by factors of 5--10. For charged particles, the combined influence of modified gravity and nonlinear electromagnetic fields may induce chaotic trajectories in certain regimes. On the thermodynamic side, we derive full expressions for Hawking temperature, entropy, and Helmholtz free energy. Ordinary branches exhibit divergent specific heat indicating second-order phase transitions, whereas phantom branches yield consistently negative specific heat, implying thermal instability. Phantom BHs are found to possess higher Hawking temperatures and show distinct thermodynamic phase structures, including Hawking--Page-type transitions. Observational features such as BH shadows and gravitational lensing are explored, revealing parameter-dependent changes in photon sphere radii and deflection angles. Notably, the deflection angle analysis via the Gauss--Bonnet theorem method (GBTm) shows opposite-sign electromagnetic corrections for phantom versus ordinary branches, suggesting potential observational discriminants.</description>

      <title>Volume-distance-ratio asymptote and spacetime inextensibility of spatially flat FLRW spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the volume-distance-ratio (VDR) asymptote at a past timelike boundary point of spatially flat FLRW spacetime with scale factor $a(t) = t^{\alpha}$, for $\alpha \geq 1$ or $\alpha \in (0,1)$. We employ the spacetime inextensibility criteria via the volume-distance-ratio asymptote to deduce its inextensibility. We show that for spatial dimensions greater than $2$, there exists at least one nonzero critical exponent $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for which the VDR asymptote along a $\Sigma_t$-orthogonal geodesic is equal to the Minkowski value.</description>

      <title>The shadow and quasinormal modes of the asymptotically flat hairy black holes with a dilaton potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the shadow and the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of an exact asymptotically flat hairy electrically charged black hole solution with a dilaton potential are investigated. Using the {constraint} equation among the integration constant $\eta$ of the gravitational field, the mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$ and the coupling constant $\nu$ between the $U(1)$ field and the dilaton field, we find that the shadow radii, the Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ and the coordinate angular velocity $\Omega_{c}$ only significantly affected by $\nu$ if the $Q$ is close to the extremal value, especially when $\nu$ approaches to one. Furthermore, the QNMs are numerically computed by using the Hatsuda method and verify with the higher-order WKB approximations with the Pad\'e summation. We find that the QNMs are close to that of the low energy limit of the string theory when $\nu$ is large enough. In the eikonal limit, the real and imaginary parts are proved to be given by $\Omega_{c}$ and $\lambda$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Decadal upgrade strategy for KAGRA toward post-O5 gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The KAGRA Collaboration has investigated a ten-year upgrade strategy for the KAGRA gravitational wave detector, considering a total of 14 upgrade options that vary in mirror mass, quantum noise reduction techniques, and the quality of cryogenic suspensions. We evaluated the scientific potential of these configurations with a focus on key targets such as parameter estimation of compact binary coalescences, binary neutron star post-merger signals, and continuous gravitational waves. Rather than aiming to improve all science cases uniformly, we prioritized those most sensitive to the detector configuration. Technical feasibility was assessed based on required hardware developments, associated R\&amp;D efforts, cost, and risk. Our study finds that a high-frequency upgrade plan that enhances sensitivity over a broad frequency range above ~200 Hz offers the best balance between scientific return and technical feasibility. Such an upgrade would enable sky localization of binary neutron star mergers at 100 Mpc to better than 0.5 deg$^2$ in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, and improve the measurement precision of tidal deformability parameter by approximately 10% at median, compared to a network without KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Holographic F(Q,T) Gravity with Lambert Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a model of holographic dark energy using FLRW cosmology in the context of modified gravity. An extension of the symmetric teleparallel gravity is obtained by considering the gravitational action L is given by an arbitrary function f of the nonmetricity Q, where the nonmetricity Q is responsible for the gravitational interaction, and the trace of the matter energy momentum tensor T, so that L=f(Q,T). We expand on the features of the derived cosmological model in view of the relation between cosmic time and redshift as t(z)=kt0/b*f(z) where f(z) = W[b/k*e((b-ln(1+z))/k)] and W denotes the Lambert function, and discuss the evolution of the trajectories of the equation of state parameters and deceleration parameter in the evolving universe using a special then generalized version of the model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Linear Scalar Perturbation in f(Q)+f(T) class of f(Q,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the f(Q,T) model of symmetric teleparallel modified gravity in the framework of cosmological perturbation theory. Using a general approach, we extract the differential matter density equation then we simplify it as a second-order equation by considering the sub-Hubble approximation. Our analysis is then based on two different forms of f(Q,T) that we study in a classic approach and again using Holographic dark energy. Our initial results yield a significant divergence from the perturbed behavior of the LambdaCDM model, imposing stringent constraints on the feasibility of this class of theories but the HDE contribution triggers an interesting discussion.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov exponents and phase transition of charged Ads black hole in quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the phase transitions of RN-AdS black holes immersed in a quintessence field, employing Lyapunov exponents as a dynamical probe to characterize the thermodynamics of black hole. Incorporating quintessence dark energy into the RN-AdS framework, we find that the Lyapunov exponents for null and timelike geodesics display diminished chaotic behavior with increasing normalization factor of the quintessence field. This feature introduces a finite cutoff to the Lyapunov exponent of unstable circular photon orbits, setting it apart from RN-AdS black hole. At phase transition points, both the free energy and Lyapunov exponents display multivalued branches, reflecting the coexistence of distinct black hole phases. Furthermore, the discontinuity in the Lyapunov exponent can serve as an order parameter with a critical exponent of $1/2$ near the critical point, consistent with the thermodynamic criticality of van der Waals fluids.. These work suggest that Lyapunov exponents provide a framework for probing the thermodynamics of black holes.</description>

      <title>The $1/c$ expansion of general relativity in a $3+1$ formulation, revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $1/c$ expansion of general relativity within a formulation that is compatible with both the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner and the Kol-Smolkin decompositions. The Einstein-Hilbert action takes a common form for those decompositions as they are dual to each other. We first develop a method to expand this generic form and then push the expansion up to $c^{-3}$ order within this novel approach. Next, we apply our technique to the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner decomposition and expand it up to $c^{-3}$ order explicitly. In order to demonstrate the applicability of our method and to highlight the duality at the level of expansion, we also perform the expansion in the Kol-Smolkin decomposition up to $c^{-1}$ order. Lastly, we make some all-order observations.</description>

      <title>Testing Gauss-Bonnet Gravity with DESI BAO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we observationally constrain f (G) gravity at the background level using Type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon Plus (PP) sample, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and the recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by DESI. For the analysis, we consider two combinations of datasets: (i) PP + CC, and (ii) PP + CC + DESI BAO. In both cases, we determine the best-fit parameters by numerically solving the modified Friedmann equations for two distinct f (G) models, namely the power-law and exponential forms. This is achieved through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. To assess the statistical significance of the f (G) models, we employ both the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results show that both f (G) models are statistically favored over the standard {\Lambda}CDM model. Notably, the exponential model exhibits an additional future transition at redshift closer to -0.1, indicating a possible return to a decelerating phase. This distinctive behavior sets it apart from both the power-law model and the {\Lambda}CDM scenario, which predict continued acceleration into the future.</description>

      <title>Interferometric signature of higher-order images in a parametrized framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit, focusing particularly on higher-order images produced near compact objects such as black holes and their observable impact through the visibility function. Employing a robust parametrization framework proposed by Rezzolla and Zhidenko, the study systematically explores deviations from the Schwarzschild metric. A detailed theoretical analysis of interferometric observables is provided, highlighting how higher-order images imprint distinctive, measurable patterns in the visibility function, notably characterized by a staircase-like structure. By parametrically varying metric coefficients, the analysis reveals clear dependencies between spacetime deviations and key observational signatures, specifically the step heights and periodicities in the interferometric visibility. The results enhance the theoretical groundwork for interpreting data from advanced interferometric observations, potentially enabling precise tests of general relativity and the discrimination among alternative gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Love beyond Einstein: Metric reconstruction and Love number in quadratic gravity using WEFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study tidal Love numbers of static black holes in four-dimensional quadratic theory of gravity, extending the result of GR. We use worldline effective field theory (WEFT) methods to compute metric perturbations from one-point functions, treating the higher-derivative terms perturbatively. We show that insertions of scalar fields on the worldline induce non-zero tidal tails, and the corresponding Love number displays no RG running. The same conclusion holds for the insertions of tensor fields. Furthermore, for scalar dipole perturbations, we derive a Yukawa-deformed Frobenius solution and match the asymptotic behavior to fix the UV charge, finding agreement with EFT predictions of Wilson coefficients. Our work demonstrates that quadratic higher-curvature corrections induce non-zero but scale-independent tidal responses, offering a robust EFT framework to test deviations from GR in gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>New high-frequency gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions in the early Universe are a well-motivated source of gravitational waves (GWs). In this Letter, we identify a previously overlooked GW production mechanism: gravitational transition radiation, arising from graviton emission by particles whose mass changes as they pass through expanding bubble walls. Unlike conventional sources such as bubble collisions or sound waves, this mechanism operates at the microscopic scale set by the Lorentz-contracted wall thickness, leading to GW emission at significantly higher frequencies. The resulting spectrum features a distinctive shape with a peak frequency redshifting to $f_{\rm peak}\sim \gamma_w T_0\sim \gamma_w\times 10^{10}\,{\rm Hz}$ where $\gamma_w$ is the Lorentz boost factor of the wall velocity and $T_0$ is the current temperature of the Universe. This mechanism is generic and is expected to operate similarly for domain walls and other relativistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Position drift with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proper motion (also known as position drift) field of extragalactic sources at cosmological distances across our sky can be used to measure the acceleration of the Solar System through the aberration effect. If measured very precisely, the signal would also hold cosmological information, for instance about bulk flows of distant sources or the presence of tensor modes. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, the acceleration of the Solar System is by far the dominant contributor to the position drift signal for sources at cosmological distances, and the measurement is therefore expected to yield a constant spheroidal dipole across redshifts as long as convergence to the cosmic restframe has been reached. The aim of this paper is to test this hypothesis. We analyze data from the cosmic reference frame dataset of Gaia data release 3 focusing on constraining the dipole and quadrupole in the position drift signal, with an emphasis on redshift dependence of the signal as a consistency test of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The spheroidal dipole that we find is in mild tension, at the level of $2-3\sigma$, with the constant-in-redshift signature expected from the local acceleration of the Solar System. We also find significant quadrupole components, that however do not have any significant evolution with redshift. The most straightforward interpretation of these findings is (unknown) systematic errors related to the Gaia instrumentation, but a cosmological origin is a possibility. Our analysis remains inconclusive on the cause of the redshift dependence of the dipole and warrants further investigations with upcoming data releases. We discuss possible implications of our results and highlight the importance of proper motion measurements for rest frame determinations in cosmology. In our discussion, we highlight interesting avenues for doing cosmology with Gaia data.</description>

      <title>Bounding anisotropic Lorentz Invariance Violation from measurements of the effective energy scale of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of energy-dependent photon time delays from distant flaring sources provide significant constraints on Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). Such effects originate from modified vacuum dispersion relations, causing differences in propagation times for photons emitted simultaneously from gamma-ray bursts, active galactic nuclei, or pulsars. These modifications are often parametrized within a general framework by an effective quantum gravity energy scale $E_{QG,n}$. While such general constraints are well established in the LIV literature, their translation into specific coefficients of alternative theoretical frameworks, such as the Standard-Model Extension (SME), is rarely carried out. In particular, existing bounds on the quadratic case ($n=2$) of $E_{QG,n}$ can be systematically converted into constraints on the non-birefringent, CPT-conserving SME coefficients $c^{(6)}_{(I)jm}$. This work provides a concise overview of the relevant SME formalism and introduces a transparent conversion method from $E_{QG,2}$ to SME parameters. We review the most stringent time-of-flight-based bounds on $E_{QG,n}$ and standardize them by accounting for systematics, applying missing prefactors, and transforming results into two-sided Gaussian uncertainties where needed. We then use these standardized constraints, along with additional bounds from the literature, to improve bounds on the individual SME coefficients of the photon sector by about an order of magnitude. A consistent methodology is developed to perform this conversion from the general LIV framework to the SME formalism.</description>

      <title>The dyonic Kerr-Schild ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a geometric extension of the Kerr-Schild ansatz that incorporates both electric and magnetic sectors of the Maxwell field in a unified framework, without resorting to duality rotations. We start observing that the known purely electric solution satisfies Maxwell's equations due to a closedness condition obeyed by the Kerr-Schild null congruence. From the associated local exactness property, we construct a new one-form naturally linked to the congruence as a sort of Poincar\'e dualization. This leads us to propose a geometrically motivated dyonic vector potential within the Kerr-Schild ansatz, defined as a superposition of an electric contribution along the congruence and a magnetic one that aligns to the dualized one-form. We then show that for a stationary and axisymmetric Kerr-Schild ansatz, the electrovac circularity theorem uniquely constrains not only the scalar profile of the metric, but also those associated to the electric-magnetic splitting of the gauge field. The resulting formalism provides a transparent derivation of the dyonic Kerr-Newman solution and extends naturally to the (A)dS case, highlighting the intrinsic interplay between geometry and matter in a Kerr-Schild setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravity-mediated entanglement experiments employ concepts from quantum information to argue that if gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems, then gravity cannot be described by a classical system. However, the proposed experiments remain beyond out current technological capability, with optimistic projections placing the experiment outside of short-term future. Here we leverage quantum information techniques to argue that current matter-wave interferometers are sufficient to indirectly prove that gravitational interaction creates entanglement between two systems. Specifically, we prove that if we experimentally verify the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a single delocalized system interacting gravitationally with an external mass, then the time evolution of two delocalized systems will lead to gravity-mediated entanglement. Our findings indicate that the experimental verification of the quantum essence of gravity is on the horizon.</description>

      <title>Visualising relativistic effects in redshift space distortions of large scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing large scale structure in redshift space gives rise to the well known redshift space distortions whereby a spherical distribution of galaxies is distorted into an ellipsoid along the line of sight of the observer. This effect is important on linear scales and so can be thought of as a Newtonian correction to the density perturbation even though their physical origin is in the Doppler effect. On larger scales subtler aspects of the Doppler and gravitational redshift effects give rise to further distortions in redshift space. These further contort objects beyond an ellipsoidal compression, into shapes with broken line-of-sight symmetry such as an egg- or bean-like shapes. In this paper, we aim to qualitatively picture how large over-dense regions, including clusters or superclusters, and under-dense regions, such as voids, undergoing infall or outflow respectively, become distorted in redshift space when higher-order relativistic effects are taken into account. This will contribute when analysing structure in real space such as stacking voids which are no longer radially symmetric when these effects are included.</description>

Abstract: We construct a consistent three-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory as a vector-tensor theory within the generalized Proca class by employing a regularization procedure based on the Weyl geometry, which was introduced recently in arXiv:2504.13084. We then obtain an asymptotically AdS$_3$, static, and circularly symmetric black hole solution with primary Proca hair. Afterwards, we investigate the effect of the scalar-tensor Gauss-Bonnet coupling constructed previously by different regularization schemes. We further generalize these solutions by incorporating an electric charge.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruptions of close white dwarf binaries by intermediate mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a suite of numerical simulations of tidal disruption events, using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for a close binary system consisting of two low-mass white dwarfs, and an intermediate mass non-spinning black hole. The binary components are considered to be detached and on the same plane with the black hole. Our results quantify how the outcomes of these events depend crucially on the positional configuration of the binary components at the orbital pericenter, and we also show how distinctive behaviour for non-identical mass binaries arise, as compared to identical ones. We highlight these differences on observables such as mass fallback rates, kick velocities and gravitational waves, and also compute clump formation time within the stellar debris. In our setup, prograde binary motion, where the angular momentum of the binary is in the same direction as that of the center of mass motion around the black hole, is qualitatively similar to multiple events of single star tidal disruptions. However, we argue that interactions between stellar debris in the corresponding retrograde scenarios result in different and distinct outcomes. Our results should serve as indicative benchmarks in the observational aspects of tidal interactions between close white dwarf binaries and intermediate mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Characterisation of Silicon for the ETpathfinder Test Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of gravitational-wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, is designed to reduce noise in a wide band of frequencies compared to the current generation, through the use of new technologies. ETpathfinder, designed as an R&amp;D facility for these technologies, is a prototype for which the mirrors were chosen to be made of crystalline silicon, produced by the Leibniz-Institut f\"ur Kristallz\"uchtung. This material choice was made to pave the way for a low thermal noise level at cryogenic temperatures in the Einstein Telescope. This paper shows the mechanical loss of silicon designated to become the test masses for ETpathfinder in the range between room temperature and 53K. In addition, the effect of the anisotropic nature of silicon on the measurement procedure is addressed. Predictions are made of the contribution of the mirror substrate material to the overall ETpathfinder noise budget.</description>

      <title>Regular Rotating Black Hole: Probing the boundaries of the Radiative Signatures and Jet Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed observational analysis of several galactic X-ray binaries, focusing on the interplay between black hole spin, jet power, and radiative efficiency within the context of Blandford-Znajek-powered jets. Using updated measurements from continuum fitting and Fe-line methods, we constrain the spin parameter a and the deviation parameter $\beta$ for five key black hole systems: H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, GRS 1124-683, GRO J1655-40, and GRS 1915+105. For each system, we compare the allowed parameter spaces derived independently from observed radiative efficiencies and emitted jet powers under different assumptions for the jet Lorentz factor $\Gamma=2,5$. By overlapping these observational constraints with theoretical expectations for regular black holes, we assess the viability of various spin-deviation combinations in explaining the observed phenomena. Our results reveal significant restrictions on the allowed values of $\beta$, with typical upper bounds around 0.38 - 0.4, except for rapidly spinning sources where the constraint becomes notably tighter. We further present a modified method for generating rotating solutions from static regular black hole spacetimes and provide a robust theoretical framework for relating jet power to black hole angular frequency in curved geometries. We also find that the theoretical jet power is modified by regularization factor for regular black holes. These findings place stringent observational bounds on deviations from the Kerr geometry and provide important insight into the astrophysical mechanisms powering accreting stellar-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Automated Algorithmic Discovery for Gravitational-Wave Detection Guided by LLM-Informed Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset. High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.</description>

      <title>Eikonal gravitational-wave lensing in Einstein-aether theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein-aether theory provides a model to test the validity of local Lorentz invariance in gravitational interactions. The speed of gravitational waves as measured from the binary neutron star event GW170817 sets stringent limits on Einstein-aether theory, but only on a combination of the theory's free parameters. For this reason, a significant part of the theory's parameter space remains unconstrained by observations. Motivated by this, we explore the propagation of gravitational waves in Einstein-aether theory over an inhomogeneous background (i.e., gravitational wave lensing) as a potential mechanism to break the degeneracies between the theory's free parameters, and hence enable new constraints on the theory to be obtained. We reduce our analysis to gravitational waves that pass far from the lens' center and short wavelength signals, both compared to the lens' gravitational radius (eikonal limit). By applying these approximations and bringing the field equations into the form of the so-called kinetic matrix and applying a formalism known as the propagation eigenstate framework, we find that the speed of gravitational waves is modified by inhomogeneities in the aether field. However, the modification is common to both gravitational polarizations and vanishes in the limit in which gravitational waves propagate with luminal speed. This lens-dependent gravitational wave speed contrasts with the lens-induced birefringence observed in other theories beyond general relativity, like Horndeski's theory. While the potential to improve tests based on gravitational-wave speed is limited, our formalism sets the basis to fully describe signal propagation over inhomogeneous spacetimes in Einstein-aether theory and other extensions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction can flip the hierarchical three-body system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the long-term effects of non-linear perturbations were found to be important for the evolution of the hierarchical triple system, which, for the central third body of a larger mass, can significantly suppress the occurrences of orbital flip that changes the sign of angular momentum of inner binary. However, as the third-body mass increases significantly, the ambient dark matter spike becomes much more dense, rendering the effect of dynamical friction non-negligible. In this work, we take the dynamical friction into account for the first time in the hierarchical triple system up to the octupole order and find that the suppressed occurrences of orbital flip could be recovered, and as the spike index increases, the number of flips could increase over a period of time; meanwhile, as both the inner and outer semi-major axes increase while keeping their ratio fixed, the number of flips could also increase over the same number of outer orbital periods, making the detection of orbital flip a potential probe of the dark matter via observations of either electromagnetic waves or gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Black holes and covariance in effective quantum gravity: A solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The issue of general covariance in effective quantum gravity models within the Hamiltonian framework is addressed. The previously proposed equations for the covariance condition in spherically symmetric models are explicitly derived. By solving this equation, a new effective Hamiltonian constraint is obtained, incorporating free functions that can account for quantum gravity effects. The resulting spacetime structure is analyzed by specifying the free functions. Remarkably, in this model, the classical singularity is replaced by a region where the metric asymptotically approaches a Schwarzschild-de Sitter one with negative mass. Thus, this new quantum-corrected black hole model avoids the Cauchy horizons presented typically in previously studied models. The covariant approach is also applicable to matter coupling in the models.</description>

Abstract: We present a Group Field Theory (GFT) quantization of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} (HK) model formulated as a non-interacting GFT. We demonstrate that the path-integral formulation of this HK-GFT provides a complete spinfoam model and a unique Fock representation that describes the quantum three-geometries of the HK model. These results provide a link to the canonical quantization of the HK model and demonstrate how GFTs can bridge distinct quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>Topology of circular orbits for charged particles around multi-horizon black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the topological properties of circular orbits is opening up new perspectives for exploring the spacetime structure around black holes. In this work, we investigate how the charged properties of particles affect the topological characteristics of circular orbits for charged test particles in asymptotically flat, AdS, and dS black holes. Our findings demonstrate that the charged properties not only influence the topological properties of timelike circular orbits but also impact those of null circular orbits. Additionally, we explore scenarios involving multiple horizons and find that for a multi-horizon black hole, if a circular orbit with fixed angular momentum and charge can exist between two neighboring horizons, there will always be at least one unstable null circular orbit and one unstable timelike circular orbit.</description>

      <title>Influence of density-dependent bag function $B(n)$ on strange stars for non-zero strange quark mass ($m_s\neq0$) in $f(R,T)$ gravity consistent with observational validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a new class of solution of the Einstein field equation for an isotropic strange star using the modified Mak-Harko type density profile along with the equation of state as proposed in the MIT bag model and considering finite mass of the strange quark ($m_s$) is presented in the framework of $f(R,T)$ gravity with $f(R,T)=R+2\zeta T$, where, $\zeta$ is the coupling parameter. To incorporate the quark matter hypothesis with a physically viable stellar framework, a baryon number density ($n$) dependent bag function $B(n)$ is analysed, using exponential type parametrisation. The energy per baryon ($E_B$) has been investigated to restrict $B(n)$ and corresponding $n$ within a stable window, specifically satisfying the condition $E_B\leq 930.4~MeV$, which corresponds to the binding energy of $\isotope[56]{Fe}$. We note a lower limit of $n$ below which $E_B&gt;930.4~MeV$ as $E_B$ increases with the decrease of $n$. This value, however, depends on $m_s$. Additionally, $n$ has a maximum value of $0.36~fm^{-3}$ irrespective of $m_s$ depending on the range of bag function. All the essential characteristics are satisfactorily fulfilled within the stellar interior for the selected set of parameter space. In this model, the maximum mass and radius are found by solving the TOV equations numerically which yields $M=2.03~M_{\odot}$ with a radius of $11.49~km$ for $m_s=0~MeV$ and $n=0.36~fm^{-3}$ and $\zeta=-0.1$. It is also noted that the maximum mass and the corresponding radius are the function of $m_s$, $\zeta$ and $n$. The proposed model has been shown to comply with the required energy conditions and satisfies the criterion for dynamical stability, thereby confirming its physical plausibility as a physically consistent stellar model within the parameter space used.</description>

      <title>Circular equatorial orbits of extended bodies with spin-induced quadrupole around a Kerr black hole: Comparing spin-supplementary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The worldline of an extended body in curved spacetime can be described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations when its centroid, i.e., its center of mass, is fixed by a spin supplementary condition (SSC). Different SSC choices result in distinct worldlines. To examine the properties of these choices, we investigate the frequency of circular equatorial orbits of extended bodies within the pole-dipole-(spin-induced) quadrupole approximation moving around a Kerr black hole for the Tulzcyjew-Dixon (TD) and the Mathisson-Pirani (MP) SSCs. First, we examine similarities and discrepancies in the prograde and retrograde orbital frequencies by expanding these frequencies in power series of the spin without taking into account the fact that both the position of the centroid and the spin measure change under the transition from one SSC to another. Then, by taking into account the centroid transition laws we examine the orbital frequencies convergence between the non-helical MP frame to the TD frame. In particular, we demonstrate that, in analogy to the pole-dipole approximation, the transition from one circular orbit to another within the pole-dipole-(spin-induced)quadrupole approximation under a change in the SSC, results in convergence between the SSCs only up to certain terms in the spin expansion and does not extend to the entire power series. Finally, we discuss the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) in the pole-dipole-(spin-induced)quadrupole approximation under TD and MP SSCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inextensibility problem of the spacetime at a future boundary point. We detect the inextensibility of the spacetime by the volume-distance-ratio asymptote of the timelike diamond approaching the future boundary point. The fundamental idea is to compare the asymptote with the one in Minkowski spacetime. By this idea, we establish the inextensibility criteria for both $C^{0,1}$ and $C^0$ regularities. As applications, we prove that i) $C^{0,1}$-inextensibility of the interior solution of the spherically self-similar naked singularity in the gravitational collapse of a massless scalar field constructed by Christodoulou. The key estimate is on the volume form of the interior solution of the naked singularity in a self-similar coordinate system. ii) $C^0$-inextensibility of the spatially flat FLRW spacetime with asymptotically linear scale factor $a(t) \sim |t|$. The key estimate is the volume comparison with the spatially hyperbolic FLRW spacetime with the scale factor $|t|$ which is the causal past of a point in the Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Averaging Dynamics of Scalar Field-Matter Interacting Models in Anisotropic Universes: The Locally Rotationally Symmetric Bianchi I Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an anisotropic cosmological model based on the locally rotational Bianchi I spacetime, incorporating a scalar field and a non-zero cosmological interaction term. The framework of averaging theory is employed to study the associated non-linear differential equations. Through a qualitative analysis of the gravitational field equations, we obtain valuable insights into the structure of the solution space for the anisotropic scalar field model with a generalized harmonic potential. The interaction between the scalar field and matter is described by a general expression that depends on the Hubble parameter, the time derivative of the scalar field, and the energy densities of cold dark matter and dark energy. This formulation involves real parameters that modulate the interaction, as well as a coupling constant with the dimensions of the Hubble parameter. We show that the Hubble parameter serves as a time-dependent perturbation parameter, controlling the discrepancy between the full system and its time-averaged counterpart. As this parameter decreases, both systems converge to the same asymptotic behaviour. This enables the suppression of oscillatory effects, significantly simplifying the dynamical analysis. Finally, we identify conditions on the interaction parameters that ensure the regularity of the system's evolution by preventing the emergence of singularities.</description>

      <title>A Dark Matter Fermionic Quantum Fluid from Standard Model Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a model of dark matter as a superconducting fluid of Cooper pairs of right handed neutrinos or of vector-like quarks. The superconducting dark matter is induced by attractive channels in the Standard Model Higgs and color sectors of the Standard Model, respectively. We show that, for each case, the solution to the gap equation provides viable dark matter candidates for suitable chemical potential values. The mechanism yields an ultra-light neutrino condensate with a mass of $m_{\rm DM} \sim 10^{-19} \text{eV}$ or a vector-like quark condensate with wide range of possible masses. Both cosmological and particle physics constraints on the model lead to a connection between the number of effective relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, and the chemical potential and CMB temperature at the time of fermion creation. We also find a relation between the superconducting fermion and baryon densities, with implications for the coincidence between the dark matter and baryon densities in standard cosmology. Given the natural $\text{eV}$ scale of neutrinos, this mechanism may have implications for the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter induces time-dependent perturbations in the spacetime metric, enabling its gravitational direct detection. In this work, we propose using astrometry to detect dark matter. After reviewing the calculation of the metric in the presence of scalar dark matter, we study the influence of the perturbations on the apparent motion of astrophysical bodies. We apply our results to angular position measurements of quasars, whose vast distances from Earth present an opportunity to discover dark matter with a mass as low as $10^{-33} \, \mathrm{eV} $. We explore the prospects of very long baseline interferometry and optical astrometric survey measurements for detecting ultralight relics, finding that for the smallest masses, current astrometric surveys can detect dark matter moving locally with a velocity of $10^{-3}$ with energy density as low as $10 ^{ - 4} ~{\rm GeV} / {\rm cm} ^3 $.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Scalar one-loop tensor power spectrum during single-field inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum. We also discuss the implications of the logarithmic contribution.</description>

      <title>No-go Theorem for Cosmological Parity Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A no-go theorem for parity-violation in even $D$-dimensional spacetimes invariant under $ISO(d)$ and dilatations (as well as the implications for odd $D$) is derived. For the case of real massless scalar and gravitons (as well as any massless even integer spin-$s$ field) at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the reality of wavefunction coefficients in Fourier space to all orders in perturbation theory (any order in loops) coming from a local, unitary, IR- and UV-finite theory, which start from the initial \CRT-invariant Bunch-Davies state in the infinite past, is proven. From this it is inferred that a parity-odd correlator with any massless scalar fields and even integer spin-$s$ fields vanishes in the presence of any number of interactions of massless fields. The same is true for correlators with an even number of conformally-coupled and massless odd integer spin-$s$ external fields, which is used to derive the cosmological analogue of Furry's theorem. The fundamental implications of \CRT symmetry for theories with chemical potentials, such as Chern-Simons and Axion inflation, is also discussed. Given the recent interest in parity-violation coming from observational claims of parity-violation detection, these results provide clear constraints on parity-violating models of inflation and establish the measurement of any parity-odd correlator as an exceptionally sensitive probe of new physics beyond vanilla inflation.</description>

      <title>Localizing quantum fields with time-dependent potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the effect of localizing quantum field degrees of freedom by dynamically growing cavity walls through a time-dependent potential. We use our results to show that it is possible to do this without introducing non-negligible mixedness in localized modes of the field. We discuss how this addresses the concerns, raised in previous literature, that the high degree of entanglement of regular states in QFT may hinder relativistic quantum information protocols that make use of localized relativistic probes.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Towards the Double Copy Formulation for the Abelian Sector of Heterotic Double Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that double field theory (DFT) action can be constructed in a perturbative manner up to cubic order by using double copy of Yang-Mills. This construction can also be extended by starting with higher-derivative Yang-Mills theory to obtain higher-derivative DFT action. In this work, we extend this classical double copy formulation to the Abelian subsector of heterotic DFT, starting with a Yang-Mills theory that includes a charged scalar field, namely (Y M + \phi^3) theory. The action we constructed by a double copy procedure exactly matches with the Abelian sector of heterotic DFT action up to cubic order.</description>

      <title>Higgs-Modular Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Higgs field as a fundamental scalar in the Standard Model within the framework of modular inflation models, where a modulus field acts as the inflaton and its interactions are governed by an underlying modular symmetry. In general, the Higgs field can participate in the dynamics of modular inflation, leading to a two-field inflationary system-termed \emph{Higgs-Modular inflation}-which exhibits non-trivial dynamics and interesting phenomenological implications. We analyze Higgs-Modular inflation both analytically and numerically, highlighting its attractor behavior and the resulting observational constraints. In particular, we find that Higgs-Modular inflation is favored by the latest data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in certain regions of parameter space. This is in contrast to both pure Higgs inflation and pure modular inflation with a Starobinsky-type potential, which tend to predict a relatively low spectral index. Additionally, we discuss the cutoff scale of this inflationary model and the reheating processes induced by the decays of the modulus and the Higgs field.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gravity-Induced Entanglement via Squeezed Input Light under Finite Measurement Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the advantage of using squeezed input light for generating gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) through Fourier-domain analysis. Based on the findings of [1], which demonstrated the feasibility of detecting GIE in optomechanical systems under quantum control, we further demonstrate that squeezed input light can reduce the optical noise in the mechanical conditional state and enhance GIE. Furthermore, we estimate the systematic and statistical errors in the measurement of GIE using the Fourier transformation over a finite measurement time. Based on the error estimations using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in GIE detection, we find that a total measurement time of 10^6 s is required to achieve SNR=1 when using squeezed input light, whereas 10^{6.8} s is needed without squeezed input light. This result highlights the effectiveness of optomechanical systems and the critical role of squeezed input light in enhancing the detectability of GIE.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Quantum Connections: Assessing the Viability of Weak Gravity and Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjectures in Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses a potential validation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) with the weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC), as a significant challenge in quantum gravity. We explore the viability of the WGC and WCCC in the context of the Kerr-Newman-Kiselev-Letelier (KNKL) black hole. Although these conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these conjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By imposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate that the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the properties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m &gt; (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M )_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present figures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the spin parameter \(a\), the cloud of string parameter \(b\), quintessence parameter \(\gamma\), and equation of state parameter \(\omega\), the black hole either has two event horizons if \(Q^2/M^2 \leq 1\) or none event horizon if \(Q^2/M^2 &gt; 1\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the WCCC. However, when \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) are present, the black hole has event horizons in some regions in the \(Q^2/M^2 &gt; 1\) that ensure the singularity is covered and both the WGC and WCCC are fulfilled. Actually, we face this issue in the extremality state of the black hole viz these conjectures remain viable, with the black hole maintaining an event horizon. We conclude that certain regions of \(a\), \(b\), \(\gamma\), and \(\omega\) parameters can make the WGC and WCCC compatible, indicating their agreement when these parameters are present.</description>
