      <title>On the Connection between the Repeated X-ray Quasi-periodic Oscillation and Warm Absorber in the Active Galaxy RE~J1034+396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an in-depth spectral analysis of $\sim1{\rm ~Ms}$ XMM-Newton data of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxy RE J1034+396. The long exposure ensures high spectral quality and provides us with a detailed look at the intrinsic absorption and emission features toward this target. Two warm-absorber (WA) components with different ionization states ($\log (\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s}^{-1}) \sim 4$ and $\log (\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s}^{-1}) \sim 2.5-3$) are required to explain the intrinsic absorption features in the RGS spectra. The estimated outflow velocities are around $-1400{\rm ~km~s}^{-1}$ and $-(100-300){\rm ~km~s}^{-1}$ for the high- and low-ionization WA components, respectively. Both absorbers are located beyond the broad-line region and cannot significantly affect the host environment. We analyze the warm absorbers in different flux states. We also examine the May-2007 observation in the low and high phases of quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). In contrast to previous analyses showing a negative correlation between the high-ionization WA and the QPO phase, we have found no such variation in this WA component. We discover a broad emission bump in the spectral range of $\sim12-18$ Angstrom, covering the primary features of the high-ionization WA. This emission bump shows a dramatic change in different source states, and its intensity may positively correlate with the QPO phase. The absence of this emission bump in previous work may contribute to the suggested WA-QPO connection.</description>

      <title>Soft no more: gas shielding protects soft binaries from disruption in gas-rich environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binaries in dense environments are traditionally classified as soft or hard based on their binding energy relative to the kinetic energy of surrounding stars. Heggie's law suggests that stellar encounters tend to soften soft binaries and harden hard binaries, altering their separations. However, interactions with gas in such environments can significantly modify this behavior. This study investigates the impact of gas on binary softening and its consequences. We find that gas interactions can actually harden binaries, extending the soft-hard boundary to larger separations. This introduces a "shielding radius" within which binaries are likely to harden due to gas interactions, surpassing the traditional soft-hard limit. Consequently, a notable portion of binaries initially classified as "soft" may become "hard" when both gas and stars are considered. We propose a two-stage formation process for hard binaries: initial soft binary formation, either dynamically or through gas-assisted capture, followed by gas-induced hardening before eventual disruption. In environments with low gas density but high gas content, the shielding radius could exceed the typical hard-soft limit by an order of magnitude, leading to a significant fraction of originally soft binaries effectively becoming hard. Conversely, in high gas-density environments, gas-induced hardening may dominate, potentially rendering the entire binary population hard. Gas hardening emerges as a crucial factor in shaping binary populations in gas-rich settings, such as clusters, star-forming regions, and possibly AGN disks. This highlights the complex interplay between gas dynamics and stellar interactions in binary evolution within dense environments.</description>

      <title>Covariant Guiding Center Equations for Charged Particle Motions in General Relativistic Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low density plasmas in curved spacetimes, such as those found in accretion flows around black holes, are challenging to model from first principles, owing to the large scale separation between the characteristic scales of the microscopic processes and large mean-free-paths comparable to the system sizes. Kinetic approaches become necessary to capture the relevant physics but lack the dynamic range to model the global characteristics of the systems. In this paper, we develop new covariant guiding center equations of motion for charges in general relativistic spacetimes that are computationally tractable. We decompose the particle motion into a fast gyration, which we integrate analytically and a slow drift of the guiding center, which can be solved numerically. We derive covariant conservation laws for the motions of the guiding centers and show, through a number of limiting cases, that the equations contain all known drift mechanisms. Finally, we present the general relativistic expressions for the various drift velocities in Schwarzschild spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Monster shocks, gamma-ray bursts and black hole quasi-normal modes from neutron-star collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first magnetohydrodynamic simulation tracking the magnetosphere of a collapsing magnetar. The collapse is expected for massive rotating magnetars formed in merger events, and it may occur many hours after the merger. The results suggest a novel gamma-ray burst (GRB) scenario, which creates a delayed high- energy counterpart of the merger gravitational waves. The collapse launches an outgoing magnetospheric shock, and a hot magnetized outflow forms behind the shock. The outflow is modulated by the ring-down of the nascent black hole, imprinting its kilohertz quasi-normal modes on the GRB tail.</description>

      <title>Hybrid GRMHD and Force-Free Simulations of Black Hole Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new approach for stably evolving general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations in regions where the magnetization $\sigma=b^2/\rho c^2$ becomes large. GRMHD codes typically struggle to evolve plasma above $\sigma\approx100$ in simulations of black hole accretion. To ensure stability, GRMHD codes will inject mass density artificially to the simulation as necessary to keep the magnetization below a ceiling value $\sigma_{\rm max}$. We propose an alternative approach where the simulation transitions to solving the equations of general relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) above a magnetization $\sigma_{\rm trans}$. We augment the GRFFE equations in the highly magnetized region with approximate equations to evolve the decoupled field-parallel velocity, plasma energy density, and plasma mass density. Our hybrid scheme is explicit and easily added to the framework of standard-volume GRMHD codes. We present a variety of tests of our method, implemented in the GRMHD code KORAL, and we show first results from a 3D hybrid GRMHD+GRFFE simulation of a magnetically arrested disc (MAD) around a spinning black hole. Our hybrid MAD simulation closely matches the average properties of a standard GRMHD MAD simulation with the same initial conditions in low magnetization regions, but it achieves a magnetization $\sigma\approx10^6$ in the evacuated jet funnel. We present simulated horizon-scale images of both simulations at 230 GHz with the black hole mass and accretion rate matched to M87*. Images from the hybrid simulation are less affected by the choice of magnetization cutoff $\sigma_{\rm cut}$ imposed in radiative transfer than images from the standard GRMHD simulation.</description>

      <title>Observations of the Crab Nebula with MACE (Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Major Atmospheric Cherenkov Experiment (MACE) is a large size (21m) Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) installed at an altitude of 4270m above sea level at Hanle, Ladakh in northern India. Here we report the detection of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission from Crab Nebula above 80 GeV. We analysed ~15 hours of data collected at low zenith angle between November 2022 and February 2023. The energy spectrum is well described by a log-parabola function with a flux of ~(3.46 +/- 0.26stat) x 10-10 TeV-1 cm-2 s-1, at 400 GeV with spectral index of 2.09 +/- 0.06stat and a curvature parameter of 0.08 +/- 0.07stat. The gamma-rays are detected in an energy range spanning from 80 GeV to ~5 TeV. The energy resolution improves from ~34% at an analysis energy threshold of 80 GeV to ~21% above 1 TeV. The daily light curve and the spectral energy distribution obtained for the Crab Nebula is in agreement with previous measurements, considering statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature expansion of the dense-matter equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we provide a new, well-controlled expansion of the equation of state of dense matter from zero to finite temperatures ($T$), while covering a wide range of charge fractions ($Y_Q$), from pure neutron to isospin symmetric nuclear matter. Our expansion can be used to describe neutron star mergers and core-collapse supernova explosions using as a starting point neutron star observations, while maintaining agreement with laboratory data, in a model independent way. We suggest new thermodynamic quantities of interest that can be calculated from theoretical models or directly inferred by experimental data that can help constrain the finite $T$ equation of state. With our new method, we can quantify the uncertainty in our finite $T$ and $Y_Q$ expansions in a well-controlled manner without making assumptions about the underlying degrees of freedom. We can reproduce results from a microscopic equation of state up to $T=100$ MeV for baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 1100$ MeV ($\sim1-2 \ n_{\rm sat}$) within $5\%$ error, with even better results for larger $\mu_B$ and/or lower $T$. We investigate the sources of numerical and theoretical uncertainty and discuss future directions of study.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of 3D explosion asymmetries of stripped-envelope supernovae by nebular line profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution -- with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the $\texttt{Prometheus-HotB}$ code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code $\texttt{ExTraSS}$ (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling -- circumventing the difficulties of representing $^{56}$Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models -- we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Diversity in hydrogen-rich envelope mass of type II supernovae (I): V -band light curve modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic study on the light curves of type II supernovae (SNe II) to investigate how they are affected by the physical properties of the progenitor and the nature of the explosion. The calculations of pre-supernova evolution, the launch of the explosion, and the light curve are carried out by \texttt{MESA} and \texttt{STELLA}. Our study encompasses a wide range of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) masses (10 - 20 $M_{\rm \odot}$), wind mass-loss rates (which control the range of hydrogen-rich envelope mass to be 3 - 12 $M_{\rm \odot}$), explosion energies (0.1 - 2.5 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg), and $^{56}$Ni masses (0 - 0.15 $M_{\rm \odot}$). Our analyses reveal that when the explosion energy is fixed, the light curve is primarily determined by the properties of the hydrogen-rich envelope, despite the large variation in the ZAMS masses. The dependencies of the light-curve characteristics on the envelope mass, radius, and explosion energy are investigated, and we establish the scaling relations connecting these quantities. We further derive a formula that corrects for effects of the $^{56}$Ni heating based on observables. Using the derived equations, we develop a method that can constrain the envelope mass with uncertainty within 1 $M_{\rm \odot}$ based on photometry. This method is applied to a large sample of $\sim$ 100 SNe II, which reveals a considerably broader range of the envelope masses estimated from observables as compared to those predicted by single star models evolving with standard stellar wind; this finding indicates that a large fraction of SNe II experience substantial mass-loss beyond the standard mass-loss prescription prior to their explosions, highlighting the uncertainties involved in the massive star evolution and pre-SN mass-loss mechanism.</description>

      <title>New polarimetric study of the galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly magnetized neutron stars (WMNS) are complicated sources with challenging phenomenology. For decades, they have been studied via spectrometry and timing. It has been established that the spectrum of WMNSs consists of several components traditionally associated with the accretion disk, the boundary or spreading layer, and the wind and their interactions with each other. Since 2022, WMNSs have been actively observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). Polarimetric studies provided new information about the behavior and geometry of these sources. One of the most enigmatic sources of the class, galactic X-ray burster GX 13+1 was first observed with IXPE in October 2023. A strongly variable polarization at the level 2-5$\%$ was detected with the source showing a rotation of the polarization angle (PA) that hinted towards the misalignment within the system. The second observation was performed in February 2024 with a complementary observation by Swift/XRT. IXPE measured an overall polarization degree (PD) of 2.5$\%$ and the PA of 24 degrees, and the Swift/XRT data helped us evaluate the galactic absorption and fit the continuum. Here we study the similarities and differences between the polarimetric properties of the source during the two observations. We confirm the expectation of the misalignment in the system and the assignment of the harder component to the boundary layer. We emphasize the importance of the wind in the system. We note the difference in the variation of polarimetric properties with energy and with time.</description>

      <title>Synchro-curvature description of $\gamma$-ray light curves and spectra of pulsars: global properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a methodological approach to generate realistic $\gamma$-ray light curves of pulsars, resembling reasonably well the observational ones observed by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope instrument, fitting at the same time their high-energy spectra. The theoretical light curves are obtained from a spectral and geometrical model of the synchro-curvature emission. Despite our model relies on a few effective physical parameters, the synthetic light curves present the same main features observed in the observational $\gamma$-ray light curve zoo, such as the different shapes, variety in the number of peaks, and a diversity of peak widths. The morphological features of the light curves allows us to statistically compare the observed properties. In particular, we find that the proportion on the number of peaks found in our synthetic light curves is in agreement with the observational one provided by the third Fermi-LAT pulsar catalog. We also found that the detection probability due to beaming is much higher for orthogonal rotators (approaching 100%) than for small inclination angles (less than 20%).The small variation on the synthetic skymaps generated for different pulsars indicates that the geometry dominates over timing and spectral properties in shaping the gamma-ray light curves. This means that geometrical parameters like the inclination angle can be in principle constrained by gamma-ray data alone independently on the specific properties of a pulsar. At the same time, we find that $\gamma$-ray spectra seen by different observers can slightly differ, opening the door to constraining the viewing angle of a particular pulsar.</description>

      <title>Impact of The Newly Revised Gravitational Redshift of X-ray Burster GS 1826-24 on The Equation of State of Supradense Neutron-Rich Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the recent advancement in producing rare isotopes and measuring their masses with unprecedented precision, the updated nuclear masses around the waiting-point nucleus $^{64}$Ge in the rapid-proton capture process have led to a significant revision of the surface gravitational redshift of the neutron star (NS) in GS 1826-24 by re-fitting its X-ray burst light curve ({\it X. Zhou et al., Nature Physics {\bf 19}, 1091 (2023)}) using Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA). The resulting NS compactness $\xi$ is between 0.244 and 0.342 at 95\% confidence level and its upper boundary is significantly smaller than the maximum $\xi$ previously known. Incorporating this new data within a comprehensive Bayesian statistical framework, we investigate its impact on the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich matter and the required spin frequency for GW190814's minor $m_2$ with mass $2.59\pm 0.05$M$_{\odot}$ to be a rotationally stable pulsar. We found that the EOS of high-density symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) has to be softened significantly while the symmetry energy at supersaturation densities stiffened compared to our prior knowledge from earlier analyses using data from both astrophysical observations and terrestrial nuclear experiments. In particular, the skewness $J_0$ characterizing the stiffness of high-density SNM decreases significantly, while the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ of nuclear symmetry energy all increase appreciably compared to their fiducial values. We also found that the most probable spin rate for the $m_2$ to be a stable pulsar is very close to its mass-shedding limit once the revised redshift data from GS 1826-24 is considered, making the $m_2$ unlikely the most massive NS observed so far.</description>

      <title>The Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT XIII: Timing, flux density, rotation measure and dispersion measure timeseries of 597 pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report here on the timing of 597 pulsars over the last four years with the MeerKAT telescope. We provide Times-of-Arrival, pulsar ephemeris files and per-epoch measurements of the flux density, dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) for each pulsar. In addition we use a Gaussian process to model the timing residuals to measure the spin frequency derivative at each epoch. We also report the detection of 11 glitches in 9 individual pulsars. We find significant DM and RM variations in 87 and 76 pulsars respectively. We find that the DM variations scale approximately linearly with DM, which is broadly in agreement with models of the ionised interstellar medium. The observed RM variations seem largely independent of DM, which may suggest that the RM variations are dominated by variations in the interstellar magnetic field on the line of sight, rather than varying electron density. We also find that normal pulsars have around 5 times greater amplitude of DM variability compared to millisecond pulsars, and surmise that this is due to the known difference in their velocity distributions.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC Galactic Bulge deep survey. I. Maximum likelihood source detection algorithm for X-ray surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an X-ray source detection method entirely based on the maximum likelihood analysis, in application to observations with the ART-XC telescope onboard the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory. The method optimally combines the data taken at different conditions, a situation commonly found in scanning surveys or mosaic observations with a telescope with a significant off-axis PSF distortion. The method can be naturally extended to include additional information from the X-ray photon energies, detector grades, etc. The likelihood-based source detection naturally results in a stable and uniform definition of detection thresholds under different observing conditions (PSF, background level). This greatly simplifies the statistical calibration of the survey needed to, e.g., obtain the $\log N - \log S$ distribution of detected sources or their luminosity function. The method can be applied to the data from any imaging X-ray telescope.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for AGILE Anticoincidence System's Background Prediction from Orbital and Attitude Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGILE is an Italian Space Agency (ASI) space mission launched in 2007 to study X-ray and gamma-ray phenomena in the energy range from $\sim$20 keV to $\sim$10 GeV. The AGILE AntiCoincidence System (ACS) detects hard-X photons in the 50 - 200 keV energy range and continuously stores each panel's count rates in the telemetry. We developed a new Deep Learning (DL) model to predict the background of the AGILE ACS top panel using the satellite's orbital and attitude parameters. This model aims to learn how the orbital and spinning modulations of the satellite impact the background level of the ACS top panel. The DL model executes a regression problem, and is trained with a supervised learning technique on a dataset larger than twenty million orbital parameters' configurations. Using a test dataset, we evaluated the trained model by comparison of the predicted count rates with the real ones. The results show that the model can reconstruct the background count rates of the ACS top panel with an accuracy of 96.7\%, considering the orbital modulation and spinning of the satellite. Starting from these promising results, we are developing an anomaly detection method to detect Gamma-ray Bursts when the differences between predicted and real count rates exceed a predefined threshold.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Wave Memory in the Next Galactic Core-Collapse Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach to detecting (linear) gravitational wave memory in a Galactic core-collapse supernova using current interferometers. Gravitational wave memory is an important prediction of general relativity that has yet to be confirmed. Our approach uses a combination of Linear Prediction Filtering and Matched-Filtering. We present the results of our approach on data from core-collapse supernova simulations that span a range of progenitor mass and metallicity. We are able to detect gravitational wave memory out to 10 kpc. We also present the False Alarm Probabilities assuming an On-Source Window compatible with the presence of a neutrino detection.</description>

      <title>Numerical relativity surrogate models for exotic compact objects: the case of head-on mergers of equal-mass Proca stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present several high-accuracy surrogate models for gravitational-wave signals from equal-mass head-on mergers of Proca stars, computed through the Newman-Penrose scalar $\psi_4$. We also discuss the current state of the model extensions to mergers of Proca stars with different masses, and the particular challenges that these present. The models are divided in two main categories: two-stage and monolithic. In the two-stage models, a dimensional reduction algorithm is applied to embed the data in a reduced feature space, which is then interpolated in terms of the physical parameters. For the monolithic models, a single neural network is trained to predict the waveform from the input physical parameter. Our model displays mismatches below $10^{-3}$ with respect to the original numerical waveforms. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of our model in full Bayesian parameter inference through the accurate recovery of numerical relativity signals injected in zero-noise, together with the analysis of GW190521. For the latter, we observe excellent agreement with existing results that make use of full numerical relativity.</description>

      <title>General relativistic force-free electrodynamics with a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic plasmas around compact objects can sometimes be approximated as being force-free. In this limit, the plasma inertia is negligible and the overall dynamics is governed by global electric currents. We present a novel numerical approach for simulating such force-free plasmas, which allows for high accuracy in smooth regions as well as capturing dissipation in current sheets. Using a high-order accurate discontinuous Galerkin method augmented with a conservative finite-difference method, we demonstrate efficient global simulations of black hole and neutron star magnetospheres. In addition to a series of challenging test problems, we show that our approach can-depending on the physical properties of the system and the numerical implementation-be up to 10x more efficient than conventional simulations, with a speedup of 2-3x for most problems we consider in practice.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called ``Gaia BHs'' and ``Gaia NSs'', respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $2$ and $\sim 20$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

      <title>CME Deflection and East-West Asymmetry of ESP Intensity in Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the East-West asymmetry in energetic storm particle (ESP) heavy ion intensities at interplanetary shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. We use observations from NASA's ACE and STEREO missions of helium (He), oxygen (O), and iron (Fe) intensities from ~0.13 to 3 MeV/nucleon. We examine the longitudinal distribution of ESP intensities and the correlation of ESP intensities with the near-Sun CME speed and the average transit CME speed for eastern and western events. We observed an East-West asymmetry reversal of ESP heavy ion intensities from SC 23 to 24. We have determined that this change in asymmetry is caused by a shift in the heliolongitude distribution of the CME speed ratio (the ratio of CME near-Sun speed to CME average transit speed) from west to east.</description>

      <title>On the model uncertainties for the predicted muon content of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the excess of the muon content of cosmic ray induced extensive air showers (EAS), relative to EAS modeling, observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and by the tension between Auger data and air shower simulations on the maximal muon production depth $X^{\mu}_{\max}$, we investigate the possibility to modify the corresponding EAS simulation results, within the Standard Model of particle physics. We start by specifying the kinematic range for secondary hadron production, which is of relevance for such predictions. We further investigate the impact on the predicted EAS muon number and on $X^{\mu}_{\max}$ of various modifications of the treatment of hadronic interactions, in the framework of the QGSJET-III model, in particular the model calibration to accelerator data, the amount of the "glue" in the pion, and the energy dependence of the pion exchange process. None of the considered modifications of the model allowed us to enhance the EAS muon content by more than 10\%. On the other hand, for the maximal muon production depth, some of the studied modifications of particle production give rise up to $\sim 10$ g/cm$^2$ larger $X^{\mu}_{\max}$ values, which increases the difference with Auger observations.</description>

      <title>Evidence for 3XMM J185246.6+003317 as a massive magnetar with a low magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3XMM J185246.6+003317 is a transient magnetar located in the vicinity of the supernova remnant Kes\,79. So far, observations have only set upper limits to its surface magnetic field and spindown, and there is no estimate for its mass and radius. Using ray-tracing modelling and Bayesian inference for the analysis of several light curves spanning a period of around three weeks, we have found that it may be one of the most massive neutron stars to date. In addition, our analysis suggests a multipolar magnetic field structure with a subcritical field strength and a carbon atmosphere composition. Due to the time-resolution limitation of the available light curves, we estimate the surface magnetic field and the mass to be $\log_{10} (B/{\rm G}) = 11.89^{+0.19}_{-0.93}$ and $M=2.09^{+0.16}_{-0.09}$~$M_{\odot}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence level, while the radius is estimated to be $R=12.02^{+1.44}_{-1.42}$ km at $2\sigma$ confidence level. They were verified by simulations, i.e., data injections with known model parameters, and their subsequent recovery. The best-fitting model has three small hot spots, two of them in the southern hemisphere. These are, however, just first estimates and conclusions, based on a simple ray-tracing model with anisotropic emission; we also estimate the impact of modelling on the parameter uncertainties and the relevant phenomena on which to focus in more precise analyses. We interpret the above best-fitting results as due to accretion of supernova layers/interstellar medium onto 3XMM J185246.6+003317 leading to burying and a subsequent re-emergence of the magnetic field, and a carbon atmosphere being formed possibly due to hydrogen/helium diffusive nuclear burning. Finally, we briefly discuss some consequences of our findings for superdense matter constraints.</description>

      <title>Search for Nonthermal X-ray Emission in the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of our study of the X-ray emission from the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster based on INTEGRAL/IBIS data in the energy range 20-120 keV. Our goal is the search for a nonthermal emission component from the cluster. Using the INTEGRAL data over the period of observations 2003-2009, we have constructed the images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster in different energy bands from 20 to 120 keV with the extraction of spectral information. We show that in the hard X-ray energy band the source is an extended one with an angular size of 4.9 +/- 0.1 arcmins. Assuming a fixed intracluster gas temperature of 8.5 keV, a power-law component of the possible nonthermal X-ray emission is observed at a 5.5 sigma significance level, the flux from which is consistent with previous studies. However, in view of the uncertainty in constraining the thermal emission component in the X-ray spectrum at energies above 20 keV, we cannot assert that the nonthermal emission of the cluster has been significantly detected. Based on the fact of a confident detection of the cluster up to 70 keV, we can draw the conclusion only about the possible presence of a nonthermal excess at energies above 60 keV.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos play pivotal roles in determining fluid dynamics, nucleosynthesis, and their observables in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) and binary neutron star merger (BNSM). In this paper, we present a novel phenomenon, collisional flavor swap, in which neutrino-matter interactions trigger the complete interchange of neutrino spectra between two different flavors, aided by neutrino self-interactions. We find that a necessary condition to trigger the collisional swap is occurrences of resonance-like collisional flavor instability. In cases where neutrino self-interactions substantially dominate over the collision rate, the collisional swap occurs in the entire neutrino energy spectrum, while intriguing energy dependent features can emerge after the completion of flavor swap. Since flavor swaps correspond to the most extreme case in flavor conversions, they have a great potential to affect CCSN and BNSM phenomena.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino natal kicks from black-hole binary VFTS 243</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently reported observation of VFTS 243 is the first example of a massive black-hole binary system with negligible binary interaction following black-hole formation. The black-hole mass ($\approx 10\ M_{\odot}$) and near-circular orbit ($e\approx 0.02$) of VFTS 243 suggest that the progenitor star experienced complete collapse, with energy-momentum being lost predominantly through neutrinos. VFTS 243 enables us to constrain the natal kick and neutrino-emission asymmetry during black-hole formation. At 68% C.L., the natal kick velocity (mass decrement) is $\lesssim 10$ km/s ($\lesssim 1.0\ M_{\odot}$), with a full probability distribution that peaks when $\approx 0.3\ M_{\odot}$ were ejected, presumably in neutrinos, and the black hole experienced a natal kick of $4$ km/s. The neutrino-emission asymmetry is $\lesssim 4$%, with best fit values of $\sim$0-0.2%. Such a small neutrino natal kick accompanying black-hole formation is in agreement with theoretical predictions.</description>

Abstract: Recent studies by LHAASO have shown the presence of high-luminosity PeVatrons in our Galaxy. We examine two notable sources, each consisting of two pulsars, detected by LHAASO. We study gamma and cosmic-ray emissions from these surrounding pulsars. We simulated particle propagation throughout the Galaxy using the GALPROP software, accounting for emission from energy losses due to spin-down. As a result, we present the particle spectra generated during this propagation phase along with the corresponding gamma-ray emission. Furthermore, we used the Gammapy software to perform gamma-ray measurements from these sources in anticipation of future analyses to be carried out with the CTA observatory, which is now under development. The findings suggest that CTA may have the capability to detect these sources and show that the data can be explained by gamma rays coming from a leptonic model.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast compact binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02269v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The duration of orbital decay induced by gravitational waves (GWs) is often the bottleneck of the evolutionary phases going from star formation to a merger. We show here that kicks imparted to the newly born compact object during the second collapse generically result in a GW merger time distribution behaving like $dN/d\log t \propto t^{2/7}$ at short durations, leading to ultrafast mergers. Namely, a nonnegligible fraction of neutron star binaries, formed in this way, will merge on a time scale as short as 10 Myr, and a small fraction will merge even on a time scale less than 10 kyr. The results can be applied to different types of compact binaries. We discuss here the implications for binary neutron star mergers. These include unique short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), eccentric and misaligned mergers, $r$-process enrichment in the very early Universe and in highly star-forming regions, and possible radio precursors. Interestingly, we conclude that among the few hundred short GRBs detected so far, a few must have formed via this ultrafast channel.</description>

Abstract: Burst with memory events are potential transient gravitational wave sources for the maturing pulsar timing array (PTA) efforts. We provide a computationally efficient prescription to model pulsar timing residuals induced by supermassive black hole pairs in general relativistic hyperbolic trajectories employing a Keplerian-type parametric solution. Injection studies have been pursued on the resulting bursts with linear GW memory (LGWM) events with simulated datasets to test the performance of our pipeline, followed by its application to the publicly available NANOGrav 12.5-year (NG12.5) dataset. Given the absence of any evidence of LGWM events within the real NG12.5 dataset, we impose 95\% upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude as a function of the sky location of the source and certain characteristic frequency ($n$) of the signal. The upper limits are computed using a signal model that takes into account the presence of intrinsic timing noise specific to each pulsar, as well as a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise, alongside the LGWM signal. Our investigations reveal that the $95\%$ upper limits on LGWM amplitude, marginalized over all other parameters, is 3.48 $\pm 0.51 \ \mu$s for $n&gt;3.16$ nHz. This effort should be relevant for constraining both burst and memory events in the upcoming International Pulsar Timing Array data releases.</description>

      <title>Bulk properties of PSR J0030+0451 inferred with the compactness measurement of NICER</title>

Abstract: In 2019, Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) mission released its findings on the mass and radius of the isolated neutron star (INS) PSR J0030+0451, revealing a mass of approximately 1.4 solar masses ($M_{\odot}$) and a radius near 13 kilometers. However, the recent re-analysis by the NICER collaboration \citep{vinciguerra2024updated} suggests that the available data primarily yields a precise inference of the compactness for this source while the resulting mass and radius are strongly model-dependent and diverse (the 68.3\% credible regions just overlap slightly for the ST+PDT and PDT-U models). By integrating this compactness data with the equation of state (EoS) refined by our latest investigations, we have deduced the mass and radius for PSR J0030+0451, delivering estimates of $M=1.48^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~M_\odot$ and $R=12.38_{-0.70}^{+0.51}~{\rm km}$ for the compactness found in ST+PDT model, alongside $M=1.47^{+0.14}_{-0.20}~M_\odot$ and $R=12.37_{-0.69}^{+0.50}~{\rm km}$ for the compactness in PDT-U model. These two groups of results are well consistent with each other and the direct X-ray data inference within the ST+PDT model seems to be favored. Additionally, we have calculated the tidal deformability, moment of inertia, and gravitational binding energy for this NS. Furthermore, employing these refined EoS models, we have updated mass-radius estimates for three INSs with established gravitational redshifts.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes triggered by QCD axion bubbles</title>

Abstract: The supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are ubiquitous in the center of galaxies, although the origin of their massive seeds is still unknown. In this paper, we investigate the SMBHs formation from the QCD axion bubbles. In this case, the primordial black holes (PBHs) are considered as the seeds of SMBHs, which are generated from the QCD axion bubbles due to an explicit Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking after inflation. The QCD axion bubbles are formed when the QCD axion starts to oscillate during the QCD phase transition. We consider a general case in which the axion bubbles are formed with the bubble effective angle $\theta_{\rm eff}\in(0, \, \pi]$, leading to the minimum PBH mass $\sim\mathcal{O}(10^4-10^7)M_\odot$ for the axion decay constant $f_a\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{16})\, \rm GeV$. The PBHs at this mass region may account for the seeds of SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Rapid Spectral Parameter Prediction for Black Hole X-Ray Binaries using Physicalised Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries (BHBs) offer insights into extreme gravitational environments and the testing of general relativity. The X-ray spectrum collected by NICER offers valuable information on the properties and behaviour of BHBs through spectral fitting. However, traditional spectral fitting methods are slow and scale poorly with model complexity. This paper presents a new semi-supervised autoencoder neural network for parameter prediction and spectral reconstruction of BHBs, showing an improvement of up to a factor of 2,700 in speed while maintaining comparable accuracy. The approach maps the spectral features from the numerous outbursts catalogued by NICER and generalises them to new systems for efficient and accurate spectral fitting. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in the spectral fitting of BHBs and holds promise for use in other areas of astronomy and physics for categorising large datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the nuclear symmetry energy slope ($L$) can affect the hadron-quark phase transition and neutron star properties. We show that the main physical quantities as the critical chemical potential and pressure are strongly influenced by the symmetry energy slope. In extreme cases, the total amount of deconfined quarks can reach up to 99$\%$ of the hybrid star mass.</description>

      <title>Detectability of stochastic gravitational wave background from weakly hyperbolic encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background generated by black hole-black hole (BH-BH) hyperbolic encounters with eccentricities close to one and compare them with the respective sensitivity curves of planned GW detectors. We use the Keplerian potential to model the orbits of the encounters and the quadrupole formula to compute the emitted GWs. We take into account hyperbolic encounters that take place in clusters up to redshift $5$ and with BH masses spanning from $5 M_{\odot}$ to $55 M_{\odot}$. We assume the clusters to be virialized and study several cluster models with different mass and virial velocity, and finally obtain an accumulative result, displaying the background as an average. Using the maxima and minima of our accumulative result for each frequency, we provide analytical expressions for both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Our results suggest that the background from these encounters is likely to be detected by the third-generation detectors Cosmic explorer and Einstein telescope, while the tail section at lower frequencies intersects with DECIGO, making it a potential target source for both ground- and space-based future GW detectors.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Transition Energy Measurements of Neonlike Fe XVII Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve by a factor of 4-20 the energy accuracy of the strongest soft X-ray transitions of Fe XVII ions by resonantly exciting them in an electron beam ion trap with a monochromatic beam at the P04 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron facility. By simultaneously tracking instantaneous photon-energy fluctuations with a high-resolution photoelectron spectrometer, we minimize systematic uncertainties down to 10-15 meV, or velocity-equivalent +/- ~5 km/s in their rest energies, substantially improving our knowledge of this key astrophysical ion. Our large-scale configuration-interaction computations include more than four million relativistic configurations and agree with the experiment at a level without precedent for a ten-electron system. Thereby, theoretical uncertainties for interelectronic correlations become far smaller than those of quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections. The present QED benchmark strengthens our trust in future calculations of many other complex atomic ions of interest to astrophysics, plasma physics, and for the development of optical clocks with highly charged ions.</description>

      <title>Observational signatures of Rotating compact objects in Plasma space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the characteristics of shadows cast by the Kerr black hole in the presence of plasma and compared them to those of a rotating wormhole in a uniform plasma space-time for an observer at infinity. Interestingly, for the same uniform plasma density, the apparent shadow size of the rotating wormhole is always greater than that of the Kerr black hole. To further distinguish the two compact objects we studied the deflection angle and did a comparative study in the presence of the uniform and non-uniform plasma profiles. The goal of this whole exercise is to deepen our understanding of the observational phenomena of these astrophysical objects. The analysis reveals the importance of specific plasma distribution profiles, the impact of plasma on the shadow diameter, and the behavior of deflection angles in different plasma scenarios. We have calculated constraints on the plasma parameters by considering observational data and employing analytical formulations. Our work therefore provides valuable insights into the behavior of light rays near compact objects in plasma space-time.</description>
