      <title>Schemora: schema matching via multi-stage recommendation and metadata enrichment using off-the-shelf llms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schema matching is essential for integrating heterogeneous data sources and enhancing dataset discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive problem. We introduce SCHEMORA, a schema matching framework that combines large language models with hybrid retrieval techniques in a prompt-based approach, enabling efficient identification of candidate matches without relying on labeled training data or exhaustive pairwise comparisons. By enriching schema metadata and leveraging both vector-based and lexical retrieval, SCHEMORA improves matching accuracy and scalability. Evaluated on the MIMIC-OMOP benchmark, it establishes new state-of-the-art performance, with gains of 7.49% in HitRate@5 and 3.75% in HitRate@3 over previous best results. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based schema matching method with an open-source implementation, accompanied by analysis that underscores the critical role of retrieval and provides practical guidance on model selection.</description>

      <title>Towards Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment (TKGA) seeks to identify equivalent entities across heterogeneous temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) for fusion to improve their completeness. Although some approaches have been proposed to tackle this task, most assume unified temporal element standards and simplified temporal structures across different TKGs. They cannot deal with TKGA in the wild (TKGA-Wild), where multi-scale temporal element entanglement and cross-source temporal structural imbalances are common. To bridge this gap, we study the task of TKGA-Wild and propose HyDRA, a new and effective solution. HyDRA is the first to reformulate the task via multi-scale hypergraph retrieval-augmented generation to address the challenges of TKGA-Wild.In addition, we design a new scale-weave synergy mechanism for HyDRA, which incorporates intra-scale interactions and cross-scale conflict detection. This mechanism is designed to alleviate the fragmentation caused by multi-source temporal incompleteness and resolves inconsistencies arising from complex and uneven temporal event density distributions, thereby enhancing the model capacity to handle the intricacies of real-world temporal alignment. Finally, there is no standard benchmark that captures these challenges of TKGA-Wild and effectively evaluates existing methods. To this end, we formally propose to benchmark challenges for TKGA-Wild and validate the effectiveness of the method by establishing two new datasets(BETA and WildBETA). Extensive experiments on the new datasets and six representative benchmarks show that BETA and WildBETA better reflect real-world challenges. Meanwhile, HyDRA proposes a new paradigm for TKGA-Wild, consistently outperforming 24 competitive baselines, while maintaining strong efficiency and scalability.</description>

      <title>Opening The Black-Box: Explaining Learned Cost Models For Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Cost Models (LCMs) have shown superior results over traditional database cost models as they can significantly improve the accuracy of cost predictions. However, LCMs still fail for some query plans, as prediction errors can be large in the tail. Unfortunately, recent LCMs are based on complex deep neural models, and thus, there is no easy way to understand where this accuracy drop is rooted, which critically prevents systematic troubleshooting. In this demo paper, we present the very first approach for opening the black box by bringing AI explainability approaches to LCMs. As a core contribution, we developed new explanation techniques that extend existing methods that are available for the general explainability of AI models and adapt them significantly to be usable for LCMs. In our demo, we provide an interactive tool to showcase how explainability for LCMs works. We believe this is a first step for making LCMs debuggable and thus paving the road for new approaches for systematically fixing problems in LCMs.</description>

      <title>IDSS, a Novel P2P Relational Data Storage Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate at which data is generated has been increasing rapidly, raising challenges related to its management. Traditional database management systems suffer from scalability and are usually inefficient when dealing with large-scale and heterogeneous data. This paper introduces IDSS (InnoCyPES Data Storage Service), a novel large-scale data storage tool that leverages peer-to-peer networks and embedded relational databases. We present the IDSS architecture and its design, and provide details related to the implementation. The peer-to-peer framework is used to provide support for distributed queries leveraging a relational database architecture based on a common schema. Furthermore, methods to support complex distributed query processing, enabling robust and efficient management of vast amounts of data are presented.</description>

      <title>Mayura: Exploiting Similarities in Motifs for Temporal Co-Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal graphs serve as a critical foundation for modeling evolving interactions in domains ranging from financial networks to social media. Mining temporal motifs is essential for applications such as fraud detection, cybersecurity, and dynamic network analysis. However, conventional motif mining approaches treat each query independently, incurring significant redundant computations when similar substructures exist across multiple motifs. In this paper, we propose Mayura, a novel framework that unifies the mining of multiple temporal motifs by exploiting their inherent structural and temporal commonalities. Central to our approach is the Motif-Group Tree (MG-Tree), a hierarchical data structure that organizes related motifs and enables the reuse of common search paths, thereby reducing redundant computation. We propose a co-mining algorithm that leverages the MG-Tree and develop a flexible runtime capable of exploiting both CPU and GPU architectures for scalable performance. Empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that Mayura achieves substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques that mine each motif individually, with an average speed-up of 2.4x on the CPU and 1.7x on the GPU, while maintaining the exactness required for high-stakes applications.</description>

      <title>LOVO: Efficient Complex Object Query in Large-Scale Video Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in video data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic management and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from large-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing massive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query requirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis methods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or suffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system designed to efficiently handle comp$\underline{L}$ex $\underline{O}$bject queries in large-scale $\underline{V}$ide$\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to user queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained visual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build an efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding boxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector database, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO transforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate nearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal rerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with detailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates that LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with near-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while significantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the state-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new benchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient approach that excels in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Text-to-SQL for Enterprise Data Analytics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of large language models has brought rapid progress on Text-to-SQL benchmarks, but it is not yet easy to build a working enterprise solution. In this paper, we present insights from building an internal chatbot that enables LinkedIn's product managers, engineers, and operations teams to self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs, wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set. Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise Text-to-SQL solutions.</description>

      <title>Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML) capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection. Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First, we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties, architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations. This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited budgets.</description>

      <title>Enabling Data Dependency-based Query Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK) constraints are widely used for query optimization. Knowledge about additional data dependencies, such as order dependencies, enables further substantial performance improvements. However, such dependencies are not maintained by database systems or are even unknown to the user. Identifying and validating relevant dependencies automatically and efficiently remains an unsolved problem. This paper presents a system that (i) recognizes dependency candidates for optimization, (ii) efficiently validates their applicability, and (iii) optimizes query plans using valid dependencies.
  First, we demonstrate the performance impact of optimization techniques using data dependencies additional to PKs and FKs. Using rewritten SQL queries, we empirically show that data dependencies improve performance for a wide range of analytical database systems and benchmarks. Second, we present how to integrate data dependencies into a system to use them without (i) manual declaration and maintenance or (ii) SQL rewrites. Our integrated and fully automated system matches the performance of dedicated SQL rewrites: compared to using only PKs and FKs, queries improve with geometric mean speedups of 35 % for TPC-DS and 29 % for JOB. Individual query latencies drop by more than 90 %. The dependency discovery overhead is orders of magnitude lower than the latency improvement of a single workload execution.</description>

      <title>SigSPARQL: Signals as a First-Class Citizen When Querying Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) integrate computation and physical processes, producing time series data from thousands of sensors. Knowledge graphs can contextualize these data, yet current approaches that are applicably to monitoring CPS rely on observation-based approaches. This limits the ability to express computations on sensor data, especially when no assumptions can be made about sampling synchronicity or sampling rates.
  Methodology: We propose an approach for integrating knowledge graphs with signals that model run-time sensor data as functions from time to data. To demonstrate this approach, we introduce SigSPARQL, a query language that can combine RDF data and signals. We assess its technical feasibility with a prototype and demonstrate its use in a typical CPS monitoring use case.
  Findings: Our approach enables queries to combine graph-based knowledge with signals, overcoming some key limits of observation-based methods. The developed prototype successfully demonstrated feasibility and applicability.
  Value: This work presents a query-based approach for CPS monitoring that integrates knowledge graphs and signals, alleviating problems of observation-based approaches. By leveraging system knowledge, it enables operators to run a single query across different system instances within the same domain. Future work will extend SigSPARQL with additional signal functions and evaluate it in large-scale CPS deployments.</description>

      <title>SIEVE: Effective Filtered Vector Search with Collection of Indexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many real-world tasks such as recommending videos with the kids tag can be reduced to finding most similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This task, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art graph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when hard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered similarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most similar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works propose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy predicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide range of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose efficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.
  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build many indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective construction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing relationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a workload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a collection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to discern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show superior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and forms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1% build time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW graph and modest knowledge of past workloads.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Attack Investigation via Human-in-the-Loop Security Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System auditing is a vital technique for collecting system call events as system provenance and investigating complex multi-step attacks such as Advanced Persistent Threats. However, existing attack investigation methods struggle to uncover long attack sequences due to the massive volume of system provenance data and their inability to focus on attack-relevant parts. In this paper, we present Provexa, a defense system that enables human analysts to effectively analyze large-scale system provenance to reveal multi-step attack sequences. Provexa introduces an expressive domain-specific language, ProvQL, that offers essential primitives for various types of attack analyses (e.g., attack pattern search, attack dependency tracking) with user-defined constraints, enabling analysts to focus on attack-relevant parts and iteratively sift through the large provenance data. Moreover, Provexa provides an optimized execution engine for efficient language execution. Our extensive evaluations on a wide range of attack scenarios demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Provexa in facilitating timely attack investigation.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Estimation of Jaccard Containment and Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10019v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating the containment and similarity between two sets using only random samples from each set, without relying on sketches of full sets. The study introduces a binomial model for predicting the overlap between samples, demonstrating that it is both accurate and practical when sample sizes are small compared to the original sets. The paper compares this model to previous approaches and shows that it provides better estimates under the considered conditions. It also analyzes the statistical properties of the estimator, including error bounds and sample size requirements needed to achieve a desired level of accuracy and confidence. The framework is extended to estimate set similarity, and the paper provides guidance for applying these methods in large scale data systems where only partial or sampled data is available.</description>
