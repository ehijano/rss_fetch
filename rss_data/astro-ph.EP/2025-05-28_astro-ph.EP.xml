      <title>Burned to ashes: How the thermal decomposition of refractory organics in the inner protoplanetary disc impacts the gas-phase C/O ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The largest reservoir of carbon in protoplanetary discs is stored in refractory organics, which thermally decompose into the gas-phase at the organics line, well interior to the water iceline. Because this region is so close to the host star, it is often assumed that the released gaseous material is rapidly accreted and plays little role in the evolution of the disc composition. However, laboratory experiments show that the thermal decomposition process is irreversible, breaking macromolecular refractory organics into simpler, volatile carbon-bearing compounds. As a result, unlike the iceline of other volatiles, which traps vapor inwards due to recondensation, the organics line remains permeable, allowing gaseous carbon to diffuse outward without returning to the solid phase. In this paper, we investigate how this process affects the disc composition, particularly the gas-phase C/H and C/O ratios, by incorporating it into a 1D evolution model for gas and solids, and assuming refractory organics dominantly decompose into C$_2$H$_2$. Our results show that this process allows this carbon-rich gas to survive well beyond the organics line (out to $7 \mathrm{~au}$ around a solar-mass star) and for much longer timescales, such that its abundance is increased by an order of magnitude. This has several implications in planet formation, notably by altering how the composition of solids and gas relate, and the fraction of heavy elements available to giant planets. In the framework of our model, refractory organics significantly influence the evolution of the gas-phase C/O ratio, which may help interpreting measurements made with Spitzer and JWST.</description>

      <title>Jupiter's UV auroral response to a magnetospheric compression event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly elliptical polar orbit of the Juno mission provides a unique opportunity to simultaneously measure the compression state of Jupiter's magnetosphere and the total power emitted by the planet's ultraviolet aurora, using a single spacecraft. This allows us to study how Jupiter's aurora respond to a compression event. In this paper, we present a case study of an extreme compression event that occurred on December 6-7 2022 when Juno was a distance of 70 R$_{J}$ from Jupiter. This extreme compression was accompanied by a very large increase in the ultraviolet auroral emissions to 12 TW, a factor of six higher than the baseline level. This event coincided with the predicted arrival of a powerful interplanetary shock, which was expected to cause the largest increase in the solar wind dynamic pressure seen thus far during the Juno mission. The simultaneous occurrence of the interplanetary shock, the extreme compression and the bright ultraviolet aurora suggests that in this case, the auroral brightening was caused by the solar wind shock compressing the magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Ten Aligned Orbits: Planet Migration in the Era of JWST and Ariel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the diverse formation and migration pathways that shape exoplanetary systems requires characterizing both their atmospheric properties and their orbital dynamics. A key dynamical diagnostic is the projected spin-orbit angle - the alignment between the stellar spin and the planetary orbit-which provides crucial tests for theoretical models. This angle can be determined using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Although measurements exist for over 200 planets, the overall distribution of these angles is not fully understood, motivating further observations across the full parameter space. We analyze archival HARPS and HARPS-N spectroscopic transit time series of nine gas giant exoplanets on short orbits and one brown dwarf. We derive their projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$. We find aligned projected orbits for all nine gas giants as well as the brown dwarf. Furthermore, we are able to derive the true spin-orbit angle for the brown dwarf EPIC 219388192b, $\psi = $25$^{+11}_{-14}$ deg. These projected prograde orbits are consistent with quiet disc migration disfavoring violent events exciting the orbits in the history of these systems. Finally, we investigate the current overlap between spin-orbit angle measurements and atmospheric characterization targets. While we find no strong observational biases due to the spin-orbit angle, we note that the majority of planets with atmospheric data still lack spin-orbit measurements. This incompleteness of the dynamical information may limit the interpretation of upcoming atmospheric surveys.</description>

      <title>Highlights from Exoplanet Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has started a revolution in exoplanetary science. From studying in exquisite detail the chemical inventories and physical processes in gas giant exoplanets, the structure and chemical diversity of the enigmatic sub-Neptune population to even providing constraints on the atmospheric make-up of rocky exoplanets, the observatory is enabling cutting-edge science that is touching virtually every sub-area in the field. In this review Chapter, we showcase key highlights from exoplanet science being conducted with this state-of-the-art space observatory, which we believe is representative of the transformational science it is producing. One of the key takeaways from these pioneering JWST observations is how they are starting to reshape not only how we think, study and interpret exoplanet observations -- but how they are also reshaping our intuition about our very own Solar System planets.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model for the dynamical evolution of planetary systems via giant impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard model of terrestrial planet formation, planets are formed through giant impacts of planetary embryos after the dispersal of the protoplanetary gas disc. Traditionally, $N$-body simulations have been used to investigate this process. However, they are computationally too expensive to generate sufficient planetary populations for statistical comparisons with observational data. A previous study introduced a semi-analytical model that incorporates the orbital and accretionary evolution of planets due to giant impacts and gravitational scattering. This model succeeded in reproducing the statistical features of planets in $N$-body simulations near 1 au around solar-mass stars. However, this model is not applicable to close-in regions (around 0.1 au) or low-mass stars because the dynamical evolution of planetary systems depends on the orbital radius and stellar mass. This study presents a new semi-analytical model applicable to close-in orbits around stars of various masses, validated through comparison with $N$-body simulations. The model accurately predicts the final distributions of planetary mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity for the wide ranges of orbital radius, initial planetary mass, and stellar mass, with significantly reduced computation time compared to $N$-body simulations. By integrating this model with other planet-forming processes, a computationally low-cost planetary population synthesis model can be developed.</description>

      <title>Multiverse Predictions for Habitability: The Habitability of Exotic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative abundances of exotic environments provides us with (uninformed) bounds on the habitability of those environments relative to our own, on the basis that our presence here is not too atypical. For instance, since red stars outnumber yellow stars 7 to 3, we can infer that red stars must be less than 8.1 times as habitable as yellow, as otherwise our presence around a yellow star would be a statistical outlier at the level of $5\%$. In the multiverse context, the relative abundances of exotic environments can be drastically different from those in our universe, which sometimes allows us to place much stronger bounds on their relative habitability than we would get by restricting our attention to our universe. We apply this reasoning to a variety of different exotic environments: tidally locked planets, binary star systems, icy moons, rogue planets, liquids with properties different from water, and waterworlds. We find that the bounds on the relative habitability of rogue planets and waterworlds are at least an order of magnitude stronger in a multiverse context than from our universe alone. Additionally, the belief that some of water's special properties are essential for life, such as the fact that ice floats and, with some caveats, that it acts as a universal solvent, are incompatible with the multiverse hypothesis. If any of these bounds are found to be violated in the future, the multiverse hypothesis can be falsified to a high degree of confidence.</description>

      <title>Continuous Habitable Zone Metric for Prioritizing Habitable Worlds Observatory Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future direct imaging space telescopes, such as NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), will be the first capable of both detecting and characterizing terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones (HZ) of nearby Sun-like stars. Since this will require a significant amount of time and resources for even a single system or exoplanet, the likelihood that a system will host detectable life should be considered when prioritizing observations. One method of prioritization is to estimate the likelihood that an exoplanet has remained continuously within the HZ long enough for life to emerge and make a detectable impact on the atmosphere. We utilize a Bayesian method to calculate the likelihood that a given orbital radius around a star is currently in the 2 Gyr continuous habitable zone (CHZ$_2$), the approximate time it took life on Earth to significantly oxygenate the atmosphere. We apply this method to the 164 stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program Mission Star List (EMSL) for HWO, representing a preliminary sample of Sun-like stars with HZs most accessible to a future direct imaging mission. By considering the CHZ$_2$ likelihood at all orbital radii outside a hypothetical inner working angle for HWO, we define a metric for prioritizing targets according to the accessibility and total extent of the CHZ$_2$. We find that the CHZ$_2$ metric peaks between $3-4$ Gyr for late-F and early-G dwarfs, but tentatively determine that stars earlier than $\sim {F3}$ or hotter than $\sim 6600$ K are unlikely to have a CHZ$_2$ at the time of observation.</description>

      <title>Continuous helium absorption from the leading and trailing tails of WASP-107b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of helium escaping the atmosphere of exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of atmospheric escape and exoplanetary evolution. Using high-precision spectroscopic observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRISS-SOSS mode, we report the detection of significant helium absorption during the pre-transit phase of WASP-107b (17$\sigma$), as well as in the transit and post-transit phases. This unique continuous helium absorption begins approximately 1.5 hours before the planet's ingress and reveals the presence of an extended thermosphere. The observations show a maximum transit depth of 2.395$\% \pm$ 0.01$\%$ near the helium triplet (36$\sigma$; at NIRISS-SOSS resolution $\sim$ 700). Our ellipsoidal model of the planetary thermosphere matches well the measured light curve suggesting an outflow extending to tens of planetary radii. Furthermore, we confidently detect water absorption (log10 H2O=-2.5 $\pm$ 0.6), superimposed with a short-wavelength slope which we attribute to a prominent signature from unocculted stellar spots (5.2$\sigma$), rather than a small-particle haze slope. We place an upper limit on the abundance of K (log10 K$&lt;$-4.86, or K/H$&lt;$ 75$\times$ stellar) at 2$\sigma$, which is consistent with the O/H super-solar metallicity estimate. This study underscores the transformative potential of JWST for tracing atmospheric and mass-loss processes, while offering a benchmark for future studies targeting helium escape and its implications for planetary evolution.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Ephemerides Change Observations (ExoEcho). II. Transit timing variation analysis of Brown Dwarfs around Solar-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transit timing variation (TTV) is a useful tool for studying the orbital properties of transiting objects. However, few TTV studies have been done on transiting brown dwarfs (BDs) around solar-type stars. Here we study the long-term TTV of a population of close BD companions around solar-type stars using TESS data. We use the measured orbital period change rate to constrain the tidal interaction strength between the host star and the BD companion and put limits on the destruction timescale of these transiting BDs. However, we find no statistically significant evidence of orbital decay or expansion in our sample based on the current data. This may be due to either poor observational data or inherently weak tidal dissipation. We then perform simulations to investigate future observation strategies for detecting orbital decay of transiting BDs, which show NGTS-7A b, TOI-263~b and LP 261-75 b are the most promising targets in the next few years. Our study demonstrates the potential of TTV technique to probe the formation and evolution of close BD companions around solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfv\'en waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfv\'en waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfv\'en waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfv\'en waves.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec-PRISM Transmission Spectrum of the Super-Puff, Kepler-51d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kepler-51 is a 500 Myr G dwarf hosting three "super-puffs" and one low-mass non-transiting planet. Kepler-51d, the coolest (T_eq ~ 350 K) transiting planet in this system, is also one of the lowest density super-puffs known to date (rho_p = 0.038 +/- 0.009 g/cm^3). With a planetary mass of Mp = 5.6 +/- 1.2 Earth masses and a radius of Rp = 9.32 +/- 0.18 Earth radii, the observed properties of this planet are not readily explained by most planet formation theories. Hypotheses explaining Kepler-51d's low density range from a substantial H/He envelope comprising more than 30% of its mass, to a high-altitude haze layer, to a tilted ring system. To test these hypotheses, we present the NIRSpec-PRISM 0.6-5.3 micron transmission spectrum of Kepler-51d observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. We find a spectrum best fit by a sloped line covering the entire wavelength range. Based on forward modeling and atmosphere retrievals, Kepler-51d likely possesses a low-metallicity atmosphere with high-altitude hazes of submicron particle sizes spanning pressures of 1-100 microbars. However, the spectrum could also be explained by a tilted ring with an estimated lifetime on the order of ~0.1 Myr. We also investigate the stellar activity of this young Sun-like star, extracting a spot temperature significantly hotter than sunspots and spot covering fractions on the order of 0.1-10%, depending on the assumed spot parameters.</description>

      <title>Changing disc compositions via internal photoevaporation II: M dwarf systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs is a complex process. Several factors influence it, one being the inward drift and evaporation of volatile-rich pebbles. During the disc's evolution, its inner part is first enriched with evaporating water-ice, resulting in a low C/O ratio. Afterwards, C-rich gas from the outer disc is transported inwards. Consequently, the C/O ratio of the inner disc increases again after 2 Myr. Previously, we studied how internal photoevaporation influences these processes in discs around Sun-like stars. We now extend our study to lower-mass stars, where the time evolution of the disc's C/O ratio is different due to the closer-in position of the evaporation fronts and differences in disc mass, size and structure. Our simulations are carried out with the semi-analytical 1D disc model chemcomp, which includes viscous evolution and heating, pebble growth and drift, pebble evaporation and condensation, as well as a simple chemical partitioning model. We show that internal photoevaporation plays a major role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs: As for Sun-like stars, photoevaporation opens a gap, which stops inward drifting pebbles. In addition, volatile-rich gas from the outer disc is carried away by the photoevaporative winds. Consequently, the C/O ratio in the inner disc remains low, contradicting observations of discs around low-mass stars. Our model implies that young inner discs (&lt; 2 Myr) should be O-rich and C-poor, while older discs (&gt; 2 Myr) should be C-rich. The survival of discs to this age can be attributed to lower photoevaporation rates, which either originate from a large spread of observed X-ray luminosities or from the photoevaporation model used here, which likely overestimates the photoevaporation efficiency. A reduction of the latter brings the calculated elemental abundances into better agreement with observations.</description>

Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) have become a common tool in astronomy for analysing time series data, particularly in exoplanet science and stellar astrophysics. However, choosing the appropriate covariance structure for a GP model remains a challenge in many situations, limiting model flexibility and performance. This work provides an introduction to recent advances in GP structure learning methods, which enable the automated discovery of optimal GP kernels directly from the data, with the aim of making these methods more accessible to the astronomical community. We present gallifrey, a JAX-based Python package that implements a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian kernel structure learning. This approach defines a prior distribution over kernel structures and hyperparameters, and efficiently samples the GP posterior distribution using a novel involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. We applied gallifrey to common astronomical time series tasks, including stellar variability modelling, exoplanet transit modelling, and transmission spectroscopy. We show that this methodology can accurately interpolate and extrapolate stellar variability, recover transit parameters with robust uncertainties, and derive transmission spectra by effectively separating the background from the transit signal. When compared with traditional fixed-kernel approaches, we show that structure learning has advantages in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Structure learning can enhance the performance of GP regression for astronomical time series modelling. We discuss a road map for algorithmic improvements in terms of scalability to larger datasets, so that the methods presented here can be applied to future stellar and exoplanet missions such as PLATO.</description>

      <title>The role of interior dynamics and differentiation on the surface and atmosphere of lava planets</title>

Abstract: Lava planets are rocky exoplanets that orbit so close to their host star that their day-side is hot enough to melt silicate rock. Their short orbital periods ensure that lava planets are tidally locked into synchronous rotation, with permanent day and night hemispheres. Such asymmetric magma oceans have no analogs in the Solar System and will exhibit novel fluid dynamics.
  Here we report numerical simulations of lava planet interiors showing that solid-liquid fractionation in the planetary interior has a major impact on the compositional structure and evolution of the planet. We explored two styles of dynamics that depend primarily on the interior thermal state : 1) a hot fully molten interior, and 2) a mostly solid interior with a shallow day-side magma ocean.
  In the hot interior scenario, the atmosphere reflects the planet's bulk silicate composition and the night-side crust is gravitationally unstable and constantly replenished. In the cool interior scenario, the distilled atmosphere will lack Na, K and FeO, and the night-side mantle is entirely solid, with a cold surface. These two end-member cases can be distinguished with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, offering an avenue to probe the diversity of terrestrial exoplanet evolutions.</description>

      <title>Dark skies of the slightly eccentric WASP-18 b from its optical-to-infrared dayside emission</title>

Abstract: We performed a joint analysis of phase-curve observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18 b from the visible to the mid-infrared, using data from CHEOPS, TESS and Spitzer. We aim to characterise the planetary atmosphere with a consistent view over the large wavelength range covered using GCMs and retrieval analyses, and including JWST data. We obtained new ephemerides with unprecedented precisions of 1 second and 1.4 millisecond on the time of inferior conjunction and orbital period, respectively. We computed a planetary radius of $R_p = 1.1926 \pm 0.0077 R_J$ with a precision of 0.65% (or 550 km). Based on a timing inconsistency with JWST, we discuss and confirm orbital eccentricity ($e = 0.00852 \pm 0.00091$). We also constrain the argument of periastron to $\omega = 261.9^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$ deg. We show that the large dayside emission implies the presence of magnetic drag and super-solar metallicity. We find a steep thermally inverted gradient in the planetary atmosphere, which is common for UHJs. We detected the presence of strong CO emission lines at 4.5 $\mu$m from an excess of dayside brightness in the Spitzer/IRAC/Ch2 passband. Using these models to constrain the reflected contribution in the CHEOPS passband, we derived an extremely low geometric albedo of $A_g^\text{CHEOPS} = 0.027 \pm 0.011$.</description>

      <title>The Great Comets of 1843 and 1882 at Their Previous Return to Perihelion in the Twelfth Century: One Spectacular, the Other Dull</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14662</link>

Abstract: New insights into the history of C/1843 D1 and C/1882 R1, the two celebrated Kreutz sungrazers, are provided by assessing evidence on their appearance at the previous perihelion return, known as X/1106 C1 and the Chinese comet of 1138 (Ho's No. 403), respectively. The conditions differed vastly because of disparities in geocentric distance, solar elongation, and phase correction (forward scattering), all linked to the arrival times (early February vs early August). The conclusions include: the daytime sighting of the 1106 comet by Sigebert de Gembloux is consistent with expectation and so are the accounts of an exceptionally long tail observed later in twilight; the comet reached perihelion only hours before its daytime detection; the 1138 comet could have never been sighted in daylight or discovered much earlier than it actually was, in early September, one month after perihelion; at discovery, the tail is predicted to have reached elevations of 15-30 deg, while the head was only 10 deg above horizon, when observed from moderate northern latitudes; the notion that Kreutz sungrazers at perihelion between mid-May and mid-August could not be seen from the ground except possibly in daylight is misleading; the appearance of the 1138 comet's nucleus after its tidal fragmentation at perihelion is modeled on the assumption that it consisted of five major fragments (including C/1882 R1 and C/1965 S1); and unpredictable morphological changes with time in the 1882 sungrazer's split nucleus are discussed.</description>
