      <title>How to manipulate nanoparticle morphology with vacancies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacking defects in noble metal nanoparticles significantly impact their optical, catalytic, and electrical properties. While some mechanisms behind their formation have been studied, the ability to deliberately manipulate nanoparticle bulk morphology remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a pioneering mechanism - vacancy-driven twinning - that enables the transformation of face-centered cubic (fcc) gold into locally hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures. This innovative approach, demonstrated through computational simulations, facilitates the creation of realistic , randomly multi-twinned nanoparticle models. By employing a recently developed multidomain X-ray diffraction method (MDXRD), we quantitatively assess the degree of twinning. It is a crucial step in transferring theoretical studies into practical applications. Our work aims to develop tools for modifying and controlling the bulk structure of fcc nanoparticles</description>

      <title>Path-based packing of icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for designing a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. The predictions of our design strategy are confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations for several multi-component atomic clusters and nanoparticles.</description>
