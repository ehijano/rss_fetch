      <title>Identification and characterization of dominant microflora isolated from selected ripened cheese varieties produced in Uganda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were obtained from Gouda, Jack, Cheddar, and Parmesan cheeses produced in Uganda. The isolates were identified through Gram staining, catalase and oxidase tests, and 16S rDNA sequencing. Approximately 90% of the isolates were cocci (n=192), including Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus. The remaining 10% were identified as rod-shaped bacteria, primarily belonging to the Lactobacillus species (n=23). BLAST analysis revealed that Pediococcus pentosaceus dominated in all cheese samples (23.7%, of the total 114 isolates). This was followed by uncultured bacterium (15.8%), uncultured Pediococcus species (13.2%), Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (8.8%) among others</description>

      <title>Absolute concentration robustness: Algebra and geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of how biological systems maintain homeostasis in changing environments, Shinar and Feinberg introduced in 2010 the concept of absolute concentration robustness (ACR). A biochemical system exhibits ACR in some species if the steady-state value of that species does not depend on initial conditions. Thus, a system with ACR can maintain a constant level of one species even as the environment changes. Despite a great deal of interest in ACR in recent years, the following basic question remains open: How can we determine quickly whether a given biochemical system has ACR? Although various approaches to this problem have been proposed, we show that they are incomplete. Accordingly, we present new methods for deciding ACR, which harness computational algebra. We illustrate our results on several biochemical signaling networks.</description>
