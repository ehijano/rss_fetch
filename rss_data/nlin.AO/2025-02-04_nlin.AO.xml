      <title>Synchronization of the time-delayed Kuramoto model in a regular network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of delayed coupling on the global and local synchronization of identical coupled oscillators residing in a ring. Utilizing the Kuramoto model, we examine the effects of delayed coupling on collective dynamics. Our analytical and numerical results reveal distinct synchronization behaviors across various time delay regimes, including fully synchronized states, helical patterns, dynamically incoherent states, and random phase-locked states. We identify the regime in which time delay inhibits synchrony, which aligns with theoretical predictions derived from stability analysis. In the region between the synchrony-possible and synchrony-forbidden zones, a coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized dynamics is observed, referred to as Chimera states. We ascertain that the type of Chimera states present is moving-turbulent.</description>

      <title>L{\'e}vy-noise-induced wavefront propagation for bistable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of the L{\'e}vy noise's properties on wavefront propagation is analyzed on examples of ensembles of locally coupled bistable oscillators and a single bistable delayed-feedback oscillator considered as a spatially-extended system evolving in the quasi-space. It is shown that the additive L{\'e}vy noise allows to induce wavefront propagation in ensembles of symmetric bistable oscillators. In such a case, the direction and velocity of the noise-sustained propagation is determined both by the noise's skewness parameter and by the coupling topology (bidirectional and unidirectional kinds of coupling are distinguished). In addition, the additive L{\'e}vy noise induces wavefront propagation in a bistable delayed-feedback oscillator assumed to be symmetric such that its dynamics replicates the collective behaviour in the ensemble with unidirectional coupling. The wavefront propagation velocity used in this analysis is shown to be varied when adjusting the noise parameters. The revealed effects are demonstrated in the ensembles by using numerical simulation, whereas the numerical exploration of the delayed-feedback oscillator is complemented by physical experiments, showing a good correspondence and disclosing thereby the robustness of the observed phenomena.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Opinion Formation: The Adaptive Voter Model on a Hypergraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive voter model is widely used to model opinion dynamics in social complex networks. However, existing adaptive voter models are limited to only pairwise interactions and fail to capture the intricate social dynamics that arises in groups. This paper extends the adaptive voter model to hypergraphs to explore how forces of peer pressure influence collective decision-making. The model consists of two processes: individuals can either consult the group and change their opinion or leave the group and join a different one. The interplay between those two processes gives rise to a two-phase dynamics. In the initial phase, the topology of the hypergraph quickly reaches a new stable state. In the subsequent phase, opinion dynamics plays out on the new topology depending on the mechanism by which opinions spread. If the group always follows the majority, the network rapidly converges to fragmented communities. In contrast, if individuals choose an opinion proportionally to its representation in the group, the system remains in a metastable state for an extended period of time. The results are supported both by stochastic simulations and an analytical mean-field description in terms of hypergraph moments with a moment closure at the pair level.</description>
