      <title>Refractive index for the mechanical refraction of a relativistic particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analytically determined the refractive index for the mechanical refraction of a relativistic particle for its all possible speeds. We have critically analysed the importance of Descartes' metaphysical theory and extended it in this regard. We have considered the conservation of the tangential component of the relativistic momentum and the relativistic energy of the particle in the process of the mechanical refraction within the optical-mechanical analogy. Our result for the mechanical refractive index exactly matches with the forms of both the Fermat's result on Snell's law of optical refraction at the ultra-relativistic limit and the Descartes' metaphysical result on the pseudo-Snell law of optical refraction at the non-relativistic limit.</description>

      <title>The two-thirds power law derived from an higher-derivative action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-thirds power law is a link between angular speed $\omega$ and curvature $\kappa$ observed in voluntary human movements: $\omega$ is proportional to $\kappa^{2/3}$. Squared jerk is known to be a Lagrangian leading to the latter law. We propose that a broader class of higher-derivative Lagrangians leads to the two-thirds power law and we perform the Hamiltonian analysis leading to action-angle variables through Ostrogradski's procedure. In this framework, squared jerk appears as an action variable and its minimization may be related to power expenditure minimization during motion. The identified higher-derivative Lagrangians are therefore natural candidates for cost functions, i.e. movement functions that are targeted to be minimal when one individual performs a voluntary movement.</description>

      <title>The Scattering Matrix-Based Characteristic Mode for Structure amidst Arbitrary Background: Theory, Benchmark and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for computing substructure characteristic modes. This method leverages electromagnetic scattering matrices and spherical wave expansion to directly decompose electromagnetic fields. Unlike conventional methods that rely on the impedance matrix generated by the method of moments (MoM), our technique simplifies the problem into a small-scale ordinary eigenvalue problem, improving numerical dynamics and computational efficiency. We have developed analytical substructure characteristic mode solutions for a scenario involving two spheres, which can serve as benchmarks for evaluating other numerical solvers. A key advantage of our method is its independence from specific MoM frameworks, allowing for the use of various numerical methods. This flexibility paves the way for substructure characteristic mode decomposition to become a universal frequency technique.</description>
