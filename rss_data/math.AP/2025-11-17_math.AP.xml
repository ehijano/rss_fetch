      <title>Local controllability of free boundary three-dimensional semilinear radial parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a free boundary semilinear heat equation with Stefan boundary condition and radially symmetric data is locally null controllable. The strategy involves reducing the problem to the corresponding one-dimensional formulation and adapting a Carleman inequality in that setting. The local null controllability of the free-boundary problem is then established via the Schauder fixed-point theorem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first controllability result for this problem with Stefan boundary condition in more than one spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Higher Order Convergence Rates for Accelerated Wasserstein Gradient Flow Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study higher-order-accurate-in-time minimizing movements schemes for Wasserstein gradient flows. We introduce a novel accelerated second-order scheme, leveraging the differential structure of the Wasserstein space in both Eulerian and Lagrangian coordinates. For sufficiently smooth energy functionals, we show that our scheme provably achieves an optimal quadratic convergence rate. Under the weaker assumptions of Wasserstein differentiability and $\lambda$-displacement convexity (for any $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$), we show that our scheme still achieves a first-order convergence rate and has strong numerical stability. In particular, we show that the energy is nearly monotone in general, while when the energy is $L$-smooth and $\lambda$-displacement convex (with $\lambda&gt;0$), we prove the energy is non-increasing and the norm of the Wasserstein gradient is exponentially decreasing along the iterates. Taken together, our work provides the first fully rigorous proof of accelerated second-order convergence rates for smooth functionals and shows that the scheme performs no worse than the classical scheme JKO scheme for functionals that are $\lambda$-displacement convex and Wasserstein differentiable.</description>

      <title>The energy scaling behaviour of singular perturbation models of staircase type in linearized elasticity for higher order laminates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behaviour of a singular perturbation model within the geometrically linearized theory of elasticity involving data of higher lamination order. We study boundary data which are of staircase type and show rather general lower scaling bounds, both in the setting of prescribed Dirichlet data and for periodic configurations with a mean value constraint. In contrast to the setting without gauge invariances, these lower scaling bounds depend on \emph{two} parameters -- the order of lamination of the boundary data as well as the number of involved (non-)degenerate symmetrized rank-one directions. By discussing upper bounds in specific geometries and for a specific constellation of wells, we give evidence of the sharpness of these lower bound estimates. Hence, it is necessary to keep track of the outlined \emph{two} parameters in deducing scaling laws within the geometrically linearized theory of elasticity.</description>

      <title>On non-uniqueness of solutions to degenerate parabolic equations in the context of option pricing in the Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the price of call options in the Heston model is determined in a non-unique way. In this paper, this problem is analyzed from the point of view of the existing mathematical theory of uniqueness classes for degenerate parabolic equations. For the special case of degeneracy, a new example is constructed demonstrating the accuracy of the uniqueness theorem for a solution in the class of functions with sublinear growth at infinity.</description>

      <title>A quantitative Talenti-type comparison result with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a quantitative version of the Talenti comparison principle for solutions to the Poisson equation with Robin boundary conditions. This quantitative enhancement is proved in terms of the asymmetry of domain. The key role is played by a careful analysis of the propagation of asymmetry for the level sets of the solutions of a PDE. As a byproduct, we obtain an alternative proof of the quantitative Saint-Venant inequality for the Robin torsion and, in the planar case, of the quantitative Faber-Krahn inequality for the first Robin eigenvalue. In addition, we complete the framework of the rigidity result of the Talenti inequalities with Robin boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Global attractor for a Cahn-Hilliard-chemotaxis model with logistic degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a mathematical model coupling the Cahn-Hilliard system for phase separation with an additional equation describing the diffusion process of a chemical quantity whose concentration influences the physical process. The main application of the model refers to tumor progression, where the phase variable denotes the local proportion of active cancer cells and the chemical concentration may refer to a nutrient transported by the blood flow or to a drug administered to the patient. The resulting system is characterized by cross-diffusion effects similar to those appearing in the Keller-Segel model for chemotaxis; in particular, the nutrient tends to be attracted towards the regions where more active tumor cells are present (and consume it in a quickier way). Complementing various recent results on related models, we investigate here the long-time behavior of solutions under the perspective of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems. To this aim, we first identify a regularity setting in which the system is well posed and generates a closed semigroup according to the terminology introduced by Pata and Zelik. Then, partly based on the approach introduced by Rocca and the first author for the Cahn-Hilliard system with singular potential, we prove that the semigroup is strongly dissipative and asymptotically compact so guaranteeing the existence of the global attractor in a suitable phase space. Finally, we discuss the sign properties of the nutrient and prove that, under additional assumptions on the initial data, its concentration is uniformly larger than some strictly positive constant at least on finite time intervals.</description>

      <title>Entire Nodal Solutions with Prescribed Symmetry to Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of sign-changing entire solutions to weighted critical $p$-Laplace equations of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type. In doing so, we investigate classes of symmetry and show that, for suitable symmetry configurations, there exists a non-trivial solution which changes sign and respects the corresponding prescribed symmetry. In addition, we describe conditions under which these symmetry-types are incompatible. Especially, we demonstrate the existence of entire nodal solutions for an infinite number of distinct symmetry types.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new estimates for the size and structure of the nodal set $\{u=0\}$ and the singular set $\{u=|\nabla u|=0\}$ of solutions $u$ to parabolic inequalities with parabolic Lipschitz coefficients. In particular, we show that almost all of the nodal and singular sets are covered by regular parabolic Lipschitz graphs with estimates, and that both sets satisfy parabolic Minkoswki estimates depending only on a doubling quantity at a point. Many of our results are new even for the heat equation on $\mathbb{R}^{n}\times \mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Lenard-Balescu thermalization: rigorous derivation from a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a tagged particle coupled to a background of $N$ other particles, all interacting through long-range pairwise forces in the mean-field scaling, with the background initially at thermal equilibrium. Starting from the $N$-particle BBGKY hierarchy, we introduce a simplified (truncated) hierarchical model and show, in sufficiently large spatial dimension, that the tagged-particle density converges, on timescales $t\sim N$, to the solution of a linear Fokker-Planck equation, viewed as the linearization of the Landau equation. This provides, in a simplified setting, a rigorous derivation of the slow thermalization predicted by Lenard-Balescu theory. Our approach relies on a rigorous Dyson expansion in terms of Feynman diagrams and on a novel renormalization scheme that removes leading recollisions. The main technical challenge is to control the effect of phase-space filamentation within the diagrams, which we achieve by combining phase mixing and hypoelliptic regularity. Although restricted to a simplified model, our analysis offers new insight into Lenard-Balescu thermalization: notably, the renormalization appears to transform free propagators into hypoelliptic ones, providing a key mechanism that compensates for filamentation.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence of a diffeomorphism-natural MDL functional to Einstein-Hilbert with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a \(\Gamma\)-convergence result for a diffeomorphism-natural discrete MDL-type functional to the Einstein-Hilbert action with the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. On boundary-fitted, shape-regular meshes we establish interior and boundary blow-ups, identify the Carath\'eodory densities \(f_{\mathrm{in}}=\alpha_0+\alpha_1 R\) and \(f_{\mathrm{bdry}}=\beta_1 K\), and obtain the \(\liminf/\limsup\) bounds via a recovery sequence based on reflected Fermi smoothing. A boundary first-layer asymptotics shows that boundary cells contribute at order \(h^{d-1}\), yielding a global \(O(h)\) boundary remainder, while the interior remainder is \(O(h^2)\). The paper is foundational; Appendix~E specifies a reproducible protocol for rate checks and calibration of \(\alpha_0,\alpha_1,\beta_1\).</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for the fractional Calder\'on problem with a single measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the consistency of a posterior distribution in the single-measurement fractional Calder\'on problem with additive Gaussian noise. We consider a Bayesian framework with rescaled and Gaussian sieve priors, using a collection of noisy, discrete observations taken from a suitable exterior domain. Our main result shows that the posterior distribution concentrates around the true parameter as the number of measurements increases. Furthermore, we establish tight convergence rates for the reconstruction error of the posterior mean. A central technical challenge is to obtain refined stability estimates for both the forward and inverse problems. In particular, the required forward estimates are delicate to obtain because the fractional elliptic problems do not enjoy as strong regularity theory as their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic models for time-domain scattering by small particles of arbitrary shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate time-dependent wave scattering by multiple small particles of arbitrary shape. To approximate the solution of the associated boundary-value problem, we derive an asymptotic model that is valid in the limit as the particle size tends to zero. Our method relies on a boundary integral formulation, semi-discretized in space using a Galerkin approach with appropriately chosen basis functions, s.t. convergence is achieved as the particle size vanishes rather than by increasing the number of basis functions. Since the computation of the Galerkin matrix involves double integration over particles, the method can become computationally demanding when the number of obstacles is large. To address this, we also derive a simplified model and consider the Born approximation to improve computational efficiency. For the high-order models, we provide an error analysis, supported and validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers critical points of the length-penalized elastic bending energy among planar curves whose endpoints are fixed. We classify all critical points with an explicit parametrization. The classification strongly depends on a special penalization parameter $\hat{\lambda}\simeq 0.70107$. Stability of all the critical points is also investigated, and again the threshold $\hat{\lambda}$ plays a decisive role. In addition, our explicit parametrization is applied to compare the energy of critical points, leading to uniqueness of minimal nontrivial critical points. As an application we obtain eventual embeddedness of elastic flows.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of hyperbolic Busemann functions in the Newtonian N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the N-body problem we prove that any two hyperbolic rays having the same limit shape define the same Busemann function. We localize a region of differentiability for these functions, of which we know that they are viscosity solutions of the stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As a first corollary, we deduce that every hyperbolic motion of the $N$-body problem must become, after some time, a calibrating curve for the Busemann function associated to its limit shape. This implies that every hyperbolic motionof the $N$-body problem is eventually a minimizer, that is, it must contain a geodesic ray of the Jacobi-Maupertuis metric. Since the viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation are almost everywhere differentiable, we also deduce the generic uniqueness of geodesic rays with a given limit shape without collisions. That is to say, if the limit shape is given, then for almost every initial configuration the geodesic ray is unique.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multidimensional inverse scattering problem under the time-dependent repulsive Hamiltonians of quadratic type. The time-dependent coefficient on the repulsive term decays as the inverse square of time, which is the threshold between the standard free Schroedinger operator and the time-independent repulsive Hamiltonians of quadratic type. Applying the Enss-Weder time-dependent method, we can determine uniquely the short-range potential functions with Coulomb-like singularities from the velocity limit of the scattering operator.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Cauchy problem for a semilinear damped wave equation with the nonlinear term $|u|^{1+2/n} \mu(|u|)$, where $\mu$ is a modulus of continuity. In recent papers by Ebert,Girardi,Reissig (Math. Ann. 378 (2020)) and Girardi (Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 32 (2025)), the authors obtained a sharp critical condition on $\mu$ in low space dimensions $n=1,2,3$, which determines the threshold between global (in time) existence of small data solutions and blow-up of solutions in finite time. Our new results are to prove that this condition remains valid in dimension $n=4$, together with the asymptotic profiles of global solutions. From this, we see that the behavior of the solution at $t \to \infty$ is identified by the Gauss kernel. Finally, a sharp lifespan estimate for local solutions is also derived in the case when blow-up occurs.</description>

      <title>Propagation of singularities for equations with $C^{r}$ coefficients for $r&gt;1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that, for $r&gt;1$, $s$ in an $r$-dependent interval, $p$ a homogeneous pseudodifferential symbol of order $m$ having $C^{r}$ regularity in space, and $u\in H^{s+m-r}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ such that $p(x,D)u\in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, each point in the $H^{s+m-1}$ wavefront set of $u$ lies on a maximally extended null bicharacteristic of $p$ which is contained in the $H^{s+m-1}$ wavefront set of $u$. In fact, for $r=2$ slightly less than $C^{1,1}$ regularity suffices, and here the results apply to manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Plankton-Oxygen Dynamics in the Context of Climate Change: A Fractional Model with A Probability Density Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze how climate change affects marine oxygen production by modeling plankton--oxygen dynamics with a fractional-order nonlinear system and establishing rigorous conditions for the model's well-posedness. We formulate a three-dimensional system $d^\alpha x(t)/dt^\alpha = A x(t) + f(x(t))$, where $A$ is a diagonal $3\times 3$ matrix and $f$ is nonlinear. We (i) rigorously state the model, (ii) derive a Lipschitz constant for $f$ under suitable assumptions, and (iii) prove existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data using a fractional formula with a probability density kernel and a generalized Gr"onwall inequality. Under the stated conditions, $f$ satisfies a computable Lipschitz bound that yields existence and uniqueness of solutions for the fractional system, and the solutions depend continuously on initial conditions, establishing the well-posedness of the plankton--oxygen model. We introduce a fractional, PDF-kernel--based framework for plankton--oxygen dynamics and provide general proofs of well-posedness via a generalized Gr"onwall approach, capturing memory effects that classical integer-order models miss. These results justify numerical simulations and sensitivity analyses of fractional marine-ecosystem models, providing a sound basis for testing mitigation and management strategies affecting oxygen dynamics and supporting evidence-based policies for protecting marine ecosystems under global warming.</description>

      <title>Segregated solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger systems with sublinear coupling terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of infinitely many nonnegative, segregated solutions for the sublinearly coupled Schr\"odinger system \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{aligned}-\Delta u+K_1(x)u&amp;=\mu u^{p-1}+ (\sigma_1+1)\beta u^{\sigma_1}v^{\sigma_2+1}, &amp;x\in\mathbb{R}^N&amp;,
  -\Delta v+K_2(x)v&amp;=\nu v^{p-1}+(\sigma_2+1)\beta u^{\sigma_1+1}v^{\sigma_2}, &amp;x\in\mathbb{R}^N&amp;,\end{aligned}\right.
  \end{equation*}where $N \geq 2$, $p \in (2,2^*)$, $2^* = 2N/(N-2)$ ($2^* = \infty$ if $N=2$), $K_j$ are radial potentials, $\mu, \nu &gt; 0$, $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and critically $\sigma_j \in (0,1)$. The sublinear coupling exponents $\sigma_j$ introduce fundamental challenges due to nonsmooth nonlinearities and singularities in standard reduction methods. To overcome this, we develop an enhanced Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction framework. By recasting the problem within a specially constructed metric space of local minimizers for an outer boundary value problem, we derive sharp a priori estimates enabling contraction mapping arguments. This approach circumvents the limitations of classical methods for sublinear couplings. We further uncover a novel "dead core" phenomenon: solutions $(u_\ell, v_\ell)$ exhibit non-strict positivity with topological segregation. Specially, for $N=2$ and large integers $\ell$, there exist radii $0 &lt; R_1 &lt; R_2$ such that $\text{supp } u_\ell \subset B_{R_2}(0)$, $\text{supp } v_\ell \subset \mathbb{R}^N \setminus B_{R_1}(0)$, and $u_\ell + v_\ell \to 0$ uniformly in $B_{R_2}(0) \setminus B_{R_1}(0)$ as $\ell \to \infty$. Our methodology provides a versatile framework for handling nonsmooth nonlinearities in reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Failure of famous functional inequalities on Finsler manifolds: the influence of $S$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity of functional inequalities on Finsler metric measure manifolds is based on three non-Riemannian quantities, namely, the reversibility, flag curvature and $S$-curvature induced by the measure. Under mild assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature, it turned out that famous functional inequalities -- as Hardy inequality, Heisenberg--Pauli--Weyl uncertainty principle and Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg inequality -- usually hold on forward complete Finsler manifolds with non-positive $S$-curvature, cf. Huang, Krist\'aly and Zhao [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2020]. In this paper however we prove that -- under similar assumptions on the reversibility and flag curvature as before -- the aforementioned functional inequalities fail whenever the $S$-curvature is positive. Accordingly, our results clearly reveal the deep dependence of functional inequalities on the $S$-curvature. As a consequence of these results, we establish analytic aspects of Finsler manifolds, e.g., if the flag curvature is non-positive, the Ricci curvature is bounded from below and the $S$-curvature is positive, then the reversibility turns out to be infinite. Further topological properties and examples are presented on general Funk metric spaces, where the $S$-curvature plays again a decisive role.</description>

      <title>Active Contour Models Driven by Hyperbolic Mean Curvature Flow for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parabolic mean curvature flow-driven active contour models (PMCF-ACMs) are widely used for image segmentation, yet they suffer severe degradation under high-intensity noise because gradient-descent evolutions exhibit the well-known zig-zag phenomenon. To overcome this drawback, we propose hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs). This novel framework incorporates an adjustable acceleration field to autonomously regulate curve evolution smoothness, providing dual degrees of freedom for adaptive selection of both initial contours and velocity fields. We rigorously prove that HMCF-ACMs are normal flows and establish their numerical equivalence to wave equations through a level set formulation with signed distance functions. An efficient numerical scheme combining spectral discretization and optimized temporal integration is developed to solve the governing equations, and its stability condition is derived through Fourier analysis. Extensive experiments on natural and medical images validate that HMCF-ACMs achieve superior performance under high-noise conditions, demonstrating reduced parameter sensitivity, enhanced noise robustness, and improved segmentation accuracy compared to PMCF-ACMs.</description>
