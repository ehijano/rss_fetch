      <title>Further Evaluations of a Didactic CPU Visual Simulator (CPUVSIM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses further evaluations of the educational effectiveness of an existing CPU visual simulator (CPUVSIM). The CPUVSIM, as an Open Educational Resource, has been iteratively improved over a number of years following an Open Pedagogy approach, and was designed to enhance novices understanding of computer operation and mapping from high-level code to assembly language. The literature reports previous evaluations of the simulator, at K12 and undergraduate level, conducted from the perspectives of both developers and students, albeit with a limited sample size and primarily through qualitative methods. This paper describes additional evaluation activities designed to provide a more comprehensive assessment, across diverse educational settings: an action research pilot study recently carried out in Singapore and the planning of a more quantitative-oriented study in Dubai, with a larger sample size. Results from the pilot study in Singapore confirm the effectiveness and high level of appreciation of the tool, alongside a few identified challenges, which inform the planning of the more comprehensive evaluation in Dubai.</description>

      <title>MicroScopiQ: Accelerating Foundational Models through Outlier-Aware Microscaling Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization of foundational models (FMs) is significantly more challenging than traditional DNNs due to the emergence of large magnitude features called outliers. Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Palermo: Improving the Performance of Oblivious Memory using Protocol-Hardware Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oblivious RAM (ORAM) hides the memory access patterns, enhancing data privacy by preventing attackers from discovering sensitive information based on the sequence of memory accesses. The performance of ORAM is often limited by its inherent trade-off between security and efficiency, as concealing memory access patterns imposes significant computational and memory overhead. While prior works focus on improving the ORAM performance by prefetching and eliminating ORAM requests, we find that their performance is very sensitive to workload locality behavior and incurs additional management overhead caused by the ORAM stash pressure.
  This paper presents Palermo: a protocol-hardware co-design to improve ORAM performance. The key observation in Palermo is that classical ORAM protocols enforce restrictive dependencies between memory operations that result in low memory bandwidth utilization. Palermo introduces a new protocol that overlaps large portions of memory operations, within a single and between multiple ORAM requests, without breaking correctness and security guarantees. Subsequently, we propose an ORAM controller architecture that executes the proposed protocol to service ORAM requests. The hardware is responsible for concurrently issuing memory requests as well as imposing the necessary dependencies to ensure a consistent view of the ORAM tree across requests. Using a rich workload mix, we demonstrate that Palermo outperforms the RingORAM baseline by 2.8x, on average, incurring a negligible area overhead of 5.78mm^2 (less than 2% in 12th generation Intel CPU after technology scaling) and 2.14W without sacrificing security. We further show that Palermo also outperforms the state-of-the-art works PageORAM, PrORAM, and IR-ORAM.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Reconfigurable, Physically Composable Hybrid Diffractive Optical Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs), leveraging free-space light wave propagation for ultra-parallel, high-efficiency computing, have emerged as promising artificial intelligence (AI) accelerators. However, their inherent lack of reconfigurability due to fixed optical structures post-fabrication hinders practical deployment in the face of dynamic AI workloads and evolving applications. To overcome this challenge, we introduce, for the first time, a multi-dimensional reconfigurable hybrid diffractive ONN system (MDR-HDONN), a physically composable architecture that unlocks a new degree of freedom and unprecedented versatility in DONNs. By leveraging full-system learnability, MDR-HDONN repurposes fixed fabricated optical hardware, achieving exponentially expanded functionality and superior task adaptability through the differentiable learning of system variables. Furthermore, MDR-HDONN adopts a hybrid optical/photonic design, combining the reconfigurability of integrated photonics with the ultra-parallelism of free-space diffractive systems. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MDR-HDONN has digital-comparable accuracy on various task adaptations with 74x faster speed and 194x lower energy. Compared to prior DONNs, MDR-HDONN shows exponentially larger functional space with 5x faster training speed, paving the way for a new paradigm of versatile, composable, hybrid optical/photonic AI computing. We will open-source our codes.</description>

      <title>StoX-Net: Stochastic Processing of Partial Sums for Efficient In-Memory Computing DNN Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossbar-based in-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising platform for hardware acceleration of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the energy and latency of IMC systems are dominated by the large overhead of the peripheral analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To address such ADC bottleneck, here we propose to implement stochastic processing of array-level partial sums (PS) for efficient IMC. Leveraging the probabilistic switching of spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junctions, the proposed PS processing eliminates the costly ADC, achieving significant improvement in energy and area efficiency. To mitigate accuracy loss, we develop PS-quantization-aware training that enables backward propagation across stochastic PS. Furthermore, a novel scheme with an inhomogeneous sampling length of the stochastic conversion is proposed. When running ResNet20 on the CIFAR-10 dataset, our architecture-to-algorithm co-design demonstrates up to 16x, 8x, and 10x improvement in energy, latency, and area, respectively, compared to IMC with standard ADC. Our optimized design configuration using stochastic PS achieved 130x (24x) improvement in Energy-Delay-Product compared to IMC with full precision ADC (sparse low-bit ADC), while maintaining near-software accuracy at various benchmark classification tasks.</description>
