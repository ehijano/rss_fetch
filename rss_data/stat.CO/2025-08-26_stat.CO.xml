      <title>Algebraic Approach to Ridge-Regularized Mean Squared Error Minimization in Minimal ReLU Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a perceptron, a simple neural network model, with ReLU activation and a ridge-regularized mean squared error (RR-MSE). Our approach leverages the fact that the RR-MSE for ReLU perceptron is piecewise polynomial, enabling a systematic analysis using tools from computational algebra. In particular, we develop a Divide-Enumerate-Merge strategy that exhaustively enumerates all local minima of the RR-MSE. By virtue of the algebraic formulation, our approach can identify not only the typical zero-dimensional minima (i.e., isolated points) obtained by numerical optimization, but also higher-dimensional minima (i.e., connected sets such as curves, surfaces, or hypersurfaces). Although computational algebraic methods are computationally very intensive for perceptrons of practical size, as a proof of concept, we apply the proposed approach in practice to minimal perceptrons with a few hidden units.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Bounds for Sequential Monte Carlo and Adaptive Path Selection Using the $L_2$ Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.01346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a bound on the finite sample error of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) on static spaces using the $L_2$ distance between interpolating distributions and the mixing times of Markov kernels. This result is unique in that it is the first finite sample convergence result for SMC that does not require an upper bound on the importance weights. Using this bound we show that careful selection of the interpolating distributions can lead to substantial improvements in the computational complexity of the algorithm. This result also justifies the adaptive selection of SMC distributions using the relative effective sample size commonly used in the literature, and we establish conditions guaranteeing the approximation accuracy of the adaptive SMC approach. We show that the commonly used data tempering approach fails to satisfy these conditions, and introduce a modified data tempering algorithm under which our guarantees do hold. We then demonstrate empirically that this procedure provides nearly-optimal sequences of distributions in an automatic fashion for realistic examples.</description>

      <title>Adaptive reduced tempering For Bayesian inverse problems and rare event simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an adaptive sequential Monte Carlo sampling algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems in scenarios where likelihood evaluations are costly but can be approximated using a surrogate model built from previous evaluations of the true likelihood. A rough estimate of the surrogate error is required. The method relies on an adaptive SMC framework that simultaneously adjusts both the likelihood approximations and a standard tempering scheme of the target posterior distribution. This algorithm is well-suited for cases where the posterior is concentrated in a rare and unknown region of the prior. It is also suitable for solving low-temperature and rare event simulation problems. The main contribution is to propose an entropy criterion that relates the accuracy of the current surrogate to a maximum inverse temperature for the likelihood approximation. The latter is instrumental to sample a so-called snapshot, on which is performed an exact likelihood evaluation, used to update the surrogate and its error quantification. Some consistency results are presented in an idealized framework for the proposed algorithm. Our numerical experiments use in particular a reduced basis approach to construct approximate parametric solutions to a partially observed solution of an elliptic partial differential equation. They demonstrate the convergence of the algorithm and show a significant cost reduction (close to a factor of $10$) for comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fairmetrics: An R package for group fairness evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fairness is a growing area of machine learning (ML) that focuses on ensuring models do not produce systematically biased outcomes for specific groups, particularly those defined by protected attributes such as race, gender, or age. Evaluating fairness is a critical aspect of ML model development, as biased models can perpetuate structural inequalities. The {fairmetrics} R package offers a user-friendly framework for rigorously evaluating numerous group-based fairness criteria, including metrics based on independence (e.g., statistical parity), separation (e.g., equalized odds), and sufficiency (e.g., predictive parity). Group-based fairness criteria assess whether a model is equally accurate or well-calibrated across a set of predefined groups so that appropriate bias mitigation strategies can be implemented. {fairmetrics} provides both point and interval estimates for multiple metrics through a convenient wrapper function and includes an example dataset derived from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version II (MIMIC-II) database (Goldberger et al., 2000; Raffa, 2016).</description>

      <title>An Approximate Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Discretely Observed Linear Birth-and-Death Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear birth-and-death processes (LBDPs) are foundational stochastic models in population dynamics, evolutionary biology, and hematopoiesis. Estimating parameters from discretely observed data is computationally demanding due to irregular sampling, noise, and missing values. We propose a novel approximate maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for LBDPs based on a Gaussian approximation to transition probabilities. The approach transforms estimation into a univariate optimization problem, achieving substantial computational gains without sacrificing accuracy.
  Through simulations, we show that the approximate MLE outperforms Gaussian and saddlepoint-based estimators in speed and precision under realistic noise and sparsity. Applied to longitudinal clonal hematopoiesis data, the method produces biologically meaningful growth estimates even with noisy, compositional input. Unlike Gaussian and saddlepoint approximations, our estimator is invariant to data scaling, making it ideal for real-world applications such as variant allele frequency analyses.</description>

      <title>Fitting Multilevel Factor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a special case of the multilevel factor model, with covariance given by multilevel low rank (MLR) matrix~\cite{parshakova2023factor}. We develop a novel, fast implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm, tailored for multilevel factor models, to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method accommodates any hierarchical structure and maintains linear time and storage complexities per iteration. This is achieved through a new efficient technique for computing the inverse of the positive definite MLR matrix. We show that the inverse of positive definite MLR matrix is also an MLR matrix with the same sparsity in factors, and we use the recursive Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity to obtain the factors of the inverse. Additionally, we present an algorithm that computes the Cholesky factorization of an expanded matrix with linear time and space complexities, yielding the covariance matrix as its Schur complement. This paper is accompanied by an open-source package that implements the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Improved estimation of the positive powers ordered restricted standard deviation of two normal populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present manuscript is concerned with component-wise estimation of the positive power of ordered restricted standard deviation of two normal populations with certain restrictions on the means. We propose several improved estimators under a general scale invariant bowl-shaped loss function. Also, we proposed a class of improved estimators. It has been shown that the boundary estimator of this class is a generalized Bayes. As an application, the improved estimators are obtained with respect to quadratic loss, entropy loss, and a symmetric loss function. We have conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to study and compare the risk performance of the proposed estimators. Finally, a real life data analysis is given to illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange Monte Carlo methods for eigenfunction and related nonlinear problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and develop a novel particle exchange Monte Carlo method. Whereas existing methods apply to eigenfunction problems where the eigenvalue is known (e.g., integrals with respect to a Gibbs measure, which can be interpreted as corresponding to eigenvalue zero), here the focus is on problems where the eigenvalue is not known a priori. To obtain an appropriate particle exchange rule we must consider a pair of processes, with one evolving forward in time and the other backward. Applications to eigenfunction problems corresponding to quasistationary distributions and ergodic stochastic control are discussed.</description>
