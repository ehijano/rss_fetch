      <title>Data Governance and Data Management in Operations and Supply Chain: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the dynamic landscape of contemporary business, the wave in data and technological advancements has directed companies toward embracing data-driven decision-making processes. Despite the vast potential that data holds for strategic insights and operational efficiencies, substantial challenges arise in the form of data issues. Recognizing these obstacles, the imperative for effective data governance (DG) becomes increasingly apparent. This research endeavors to bridge the gap in DG research within the Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSCM) domain through a comprehensive literature review. Initially, we redefine DG through a synthesis of existing definitions, complemented by insights gained from DG practices. Subsequently, we delineate the constituent elements of DG. Building upon this foundation, we develop an analytical framework to scrutinize the collected literature from the perspectives of both OSCM and DG. Beyond a retrospective analysis, this study provides insights for future research directions. Moreover, this study also makes a valuable contribution to the industry, as the insights gained from the literature are directly applicable to real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Implementing the Typed Graph Data Model Using Relational Database Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent standardization work for database languages has reflected the growing use of typed graph models (TGM) in application development. Such data models are frequently only used early in the design process, and not reflected directly in underlying physical database. In previous work, we have added support to a relational database management system (RDBMS) with role-based structures to ensure that relevant data models are not separately declared in each application but are an important part of the database implementation. In this work, we implement this approach for the TGM: the resulting database implementation is novel in retaining the best features of the graph-based and relational database technologies.</description>

      <title>Relational Perspective on Graph Query Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a relational perspective of graph database querying. Such a perspective underlies various graph database systems but very few theoretical investigations have been conducted on it. This perspective offers a powerful and unified framework to study graph database querying, by which algorithms and complexity follow from classical results. We provide two concrete applications.
  The first is querying property graphs. The property graph data model supersedes previously proposed graph models and underlies the new standard GQL for graph query languages. We show that this standard can be, by and large, expressed by extensions of relational calculus with transitive closure operators (FO[TC]) and existential second-order quantifiers (ESO). With this, we obtain optimal data complexity bounds, along with extensions including schema validation.
  The second application is incorporating data from concrete domains (e.g., numbers) in graph database querying. We use embedded finite model theory and, by exploiting a generic Restricted Quantifier Collapse (RQC) result for FO[TC] and ESO, we obtain optimal data complexity bounds for GQL with arithmetics and comparisons. Moreover, we show that Regular Data Path Querying with operations on data (i.e. using register automata formalisms) can be captured in FO[TC] over embedded finite graphs while preserving nondeterministic logspace data complexity.</description>

      <title>iASiS: Towards Heterogeneous Big Data Analysis for Personalized Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vision of IASIS project is to turn the wave of big biomedical data heading our way into actionable knowledge for decision makers. This is achieved by integrating data from disparate sources, including genomics, electronic health records and bibliography, and applying advanced analytics methods to discover useful patterns. The goal is to turn large amounts of available data into actionable information to authorities for planning public health activities and policies. The integration and analysis of these heterogeneous sources of information will enable the best decisions to be made, allowing for diagnosis and treatment to be personalised to each individual. The project offers a common representation schema for the heterogeneous data sources. The iASiS infrastructure is able to convert clinical notes into usable data, combine them with genomic data, related bibliography, image data and more, and create a global knowledge base. This facilitates the use of intelligent methods in order to discover useful patterns across different resources. Using semantic integration of data gives the opportunity to generate information that is rich, auditable and reliable. This information can be used to provide better care, reduce errors and create more confidence in sharing data, thus providing more insights and opportunities. Data resources for two different disease categories are explored within the iASiS use cases, dementia and lung cancer.</description>

      <title>CAGRA: Highly Parallel Graph Construction and Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in various disciplines spanning data mining and artificial intelligence, from information retrieval and computer vision to natural language processing and recommender systems. Data volumes have soared in recent years and the computational cost of an exhaustive exact nearest neighbor search is often prohibitive, necessitating the adoption of approximate techniques. The balanced performance and recall of graph-based approaches have more recently garnered significant attention in ANNS algorithms, however, only a few studies have explored harnessing the power of GPUs and multi-core processors despite the widespread use of massively parallel and general-purpose computing. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel parallel computing hardware-based proximity graph and search algorithm. By leveraging the high-performance capabilities of modern hardware, our approach achieves remarkable efficiency gains. In particular, our method surpasses existing CPU and GPU-based methods in constructing the proximity graph, demonstrating higher throughput in both large- and small-batch searches while maintaining compatible accuracy. In graph construction time, our method, CAGRA, is 2.2~27x faster than HNSW, which is one of the CPU SOTA implementations. In large-batch query throughput in the 90% to 95% recall range, our method is 33~77x faster than HNSW, and is 3.8~8.8x faster than the SOTA implementations for GPU. For a single query, our method is 3.4~53x faster than HNSW at 95% recall.</description>
