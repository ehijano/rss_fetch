      <title>Bayesian Earthquake Location with a Neural Travel-Time Surrogate: Fast, Robust, and Fully Probabilistic Inference in 3-D Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian earthquake location framework that couples a Deep Learning Surrogate with Gibbs sampling to enable uncertainty-aware hypocenter estimation. The surrogate model is trained to reproduce the three-dimensional first-arrival travel-time field by enforcing the Eikonal equation, thereby removing the need for computationally intensive ray tracing. Within a fully probabilistic formulation, Gibbs sampling is used to explore the posterior distribution of source parameters, yielding comprehensive uncertainty quantification. Application to the 2021 Luding aftershock sequence shows that the proposed approach attains location accuracy comparable to that of NonLinLoc while reducing computational cost by more than an order of magnitude. In addition, it produces detailed posterior probability maps that explicitly characterize spatial uncertainty. This integration of physics-informed learning and Bayesian inference provides a scalable, physically consistent, and computationally efficient solution for real-time earthquake location in complex velocity structures.</description>

      <title>Mount Rainier and Liberty Cap Elevation Survey 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2024, we discovered that Columbia Crest, the historical summit of Mount Rainier, was no longer the highest point on the mountain. Instead, a point 133 m (436 ft) to the south along the southwest rim (SW Rim) was determined to be the new highest point on Mount Rainier. The Columbia Crest icecap melted down 6.64 m (21.8 ft) since 1998. A nearby peak, Liberty Cap, melted down 8.02 m (26.3 ft) since 2007. For this report, updated elevation measurements were taken in late summer 2025 of Columbia Crest and Liberty Cap. Columbia Crest melted an additional 0.37 m (1.2 ft) and Liberty Cap melted 0.67 m (2.2 ft) over the last year. To understand how Mount Rainier's summit may continue to evolve, we used ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to measure the thickness of the Columbia Crest icecap and Liberty Cap. As of 2025, ice is approximately 2 m - 5 m (6.6 ft - 16.5 ft) thick near the summit of Columbia Crest and 10 m - 13 m (32.8 ft - 42.7ft) thick near the summit of Liberty Cap. Using recent measurements by our team and other surveyors, melt rates for Columbia Crest have been -0.27 m/year (-0.9 ft/year) since 1998 (R squared = 0.990) and -0.49 m/year (-1.6 ft/year) for Liberty Cap since 2007 (R squared = 0.998). Based on the elevation of the nearest high-elevation visible rock, Liberty Cap will lose its status as an ice-capped peak by 2041. Assuming recent rates of change continue, it will melt to bedrock by 2047. Columbia Crest is already no longer the highest point on Mount Rainier, and it will likely melt to bedrock by 2045. As of 2025, our results indicate that the summit of Mount Rainier on the SW Rim is at an elevation of 4391.04 m (14406.3 ft +/- 0.1 ft) (NAVD88).</description>

      <title>Calendar Time Local Earthquake Forecasts from Earthquake Nowcasts: A Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Ensemble Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A previous paper discussed a method that builds on local earthquake nowcasts to produce fixed natural time forecasts, where natural time represents counts of small earthquakes since the last large earthquake. In this second paper we extend the natural time forecast to calendar time forecasts using an ensemble approach. The Gutenberg-Richter (GR) magnitude-frequency relation, which was the basis for both methods, states that for every large target earthquake of magnitude greater than MT , there are on average NGR small earthquakes of magnitude MS. The only assumption in our method is that the statistics of the local region are the same as in the larger surrounding regions. The method has significant skill, as defined by the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) test, which improves as time since the last major earthquake increases. The probability is conditioned on the number of small earthquakes n(t) that have occurred since the last large earthquake. We do not need to assume a probability model, the probability is instead computed directly as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) associated with the ROC curve. We find that for short time intervals (months), the forecast shows strong main shock clustering, followed by a gradual buildup of probability over the following years leading to the next large earthquake ("elastic rebound"). We apply the method to the same local region as in our first paper around Los Angeles, California, following the January 17, 1994 magnitude M6.7 Northridge earthquake.</description>

      <title>Microseismic event classification with a lightweight Fourier Neural Operator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of induced seismicity is crucial for mitigating operational hazards, relying on the rapid and accurate classification of microseismic events from continuous data streams. However, while many deep learning models excel at this task, their high computational requirements often limit their practical application in real-time monitoring systems. To address this limitation, a lightweight model based on the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is proposed for microseismic event classification, leveraging its inherent resolution-invariance and computational efficiency for waveform processing. In the STanford EArthquake Dataset (STEAD), a global and large-scale database of seismic waveforms, the FNO-based model demonstrates high effectiveness for trigger classification, with an F1 score of 95% even in the scenario of data sparsity in training. The new FNO model greatly decreases the computer power needed relative to current deep learning models without sacrificing the classification success rate measured by the F1 score. A test on a real microseismic dataset shows a classification success rate with an F1 score of 98%, outperforming many traditional deep-learning techniques. A combination of high success rate and low computational power indicates that the FNO model can serve as a methodology of choice for real-time monitoring of microseismicity for induced seismicity. The method saves computational resources and facilitates both post-processing and real-time seismic processing suitable for the implementation of traffic light systems to prevent undesired induced seismicity.</description>

      <title>Earth radius from a single sunrise image: a classroom-ready activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a photograph of the shadow of Mont Blanc taken from Geneva at sunrise, we derive an upper limit for the Earth radius. After presenting the observational context and the model underlying assumptions, we determine the direction of the solar rays relative to the local vertical. This direction constrains the Earth maximum diameter which -- once corrected for atmospheric refraction -- amounts to roughly 1.7 times its presently accepted value. This work illustrates a pedagogical approach to scientific inquiry, showing how simple observations, combined with reasoning and elementary mathematical and geometrical tools, can yield meaningful physical estimates.</description>

      <title>Recorded Versus Synthetic Spectral-compatible Ground Motions: A Comparative Analysis of Structural Seismic Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative analysis of structural seismic responses under two types of ground motion inputs: (i) synthetic motions generated by stochastic spectral-compatible ground motion models and (ii) recorded motions from an earthquake database. Both ground motion datasets are calibrated to a shared target response spectrum to ensure consistent spectral median, variance, and correlation structure. Five key stochastic response metrics-probability distributions, statistical moments, correlations, tail indices, and variance-based global sensitivity indices-are systematically evaluated for two representative structures: a medium-period building and a limiting case of a long-period tower. The comparison accounts for uncertainties both from ground motion and structural parameters. The results reveal that synthetic motions closely replicate recorded motions in terms of global response behavior-including distributions, mean and variance, correlation structure, and dominant uncertainty sources-indicating their suitability for routine seismic design and parametric studies. However, substantial differences emerge in response extremes for long-period structures, particularly in metrics governed by rare events, such as higher-order moments and tail behavior. These differences, which often exceed 50%, can be attributed to the non-Gaussian features and complex characteristics inherent in recorded motions, which are less pronounced in synthetic datasets. The findings support the use of synthetic ground motions for evaluating global seismic response characteristics, while highlighting their limitations in capturing rare-event behavior and long-period structural dynamics.</description>
