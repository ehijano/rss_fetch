      <title>A brief review of evolutionary game dynamics in the reinforcement learning paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation, fairness, trust, and resource coordination are cornerstones of modern civilization, yet their emergence remains inadequately explained by the persistent discrepancies between theoretical predictions and behavioral experiments. Part of this gap may arise from the imitation learning paradigm commonly used in prior theoretical models, which assumes individuals merely copy successful neighbors according to predetermined, fixed rules. This review examines recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics that employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative paradigm. In RL, individuals learn through trial and error and introspectively refine their strategies based on environmental feedback. We begin by introducing key concepts in evolutionary game theory and the two learning paradigms, then synthesize progress in applying RL to elucidate cooperation, trust, fairness, optimal resource coordination, and ecological dynamics. Collectively, these studies indicate that RL offers a promising unified framework for understanding the diverse social and ecological phenomena observed in human and natural systems.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in Island-based Ecosystem Services and Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small and medium-sized islands are acutely exposed to climate change and ecosystem degradation, yet the extent to which uncertainty is systematically addressed in scientific assessments of their ecosystem services remains poorly understood. This study revisits 226 peer-reviewed articles drawn from two global systematic reviews on island ecosystem services and climate change, applying a structured post hoc analysis to evaluate how uncertainty is treated across methods, service categories, ecosystem realms, and decision contexts. Studies were classified according to whether uncertainty was explicitly analysed, just mentioned, or ignored. Only 30 percent of studies incorporated uncertainty explicitly, while more than half did not address it at all. Scenario-based approaches dominated uncertainty assessment, whereas probabilistic and ensemble-based frameworks remained limited. Cultural ecosystem services and extreme climate impacts exhibited the lowest levels of uncertainty integration, and few studies connected uncertainty treatment to policy relevant decision frameworks. Weak or absent treatment of uncertainty emerges as a structural challenge in island systems, where narrow ecological thresholds, strong land-sea coupling, limited spatial buffers, and reduced institutional redundancy amplify the consequences of decision-making under incomplete knowledge. Systematic mapping of how uncertainty is framed, operationalised, or neglected reveals persistent methodological and conceptual gaps and informs concrete directions for strengthening uncertainty integration in future island-focused ecosystem service and climate assessments. Embedding uncertainty more robustly into modelling practices, participatory processes, and policy tools is essential for enhancing scientific credibility, governance relevance, and adaptive capacity in insular socio-ecological systems.</description>

      <title>How seed banks evolve in plants: a stochastic dynamical system subject to a strong drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how changes in population size and fluctuating environmental conditions influence the establishment of seed banks in plants. Our model is a modification of the Wright-Fisher model with seed bank, introduced by Kaj, Krone and Lascoux. We distinguish between wild type individuals, producing only nondormant seeds, and mutants, producing seeds with dormancy. To understand how changing population size shapes the establishment of seed banks, we analyse the process under a diffusive scaling. The results support the biological insight that seed banks are favoured in a declining population, and disfavoured if population size is constant or increasing. The surprise is that this is true even when population sizes are changing very slowly -- over evolutionary timescales. We also investigate the influence of short-term fluctuations, such as annual variations in rainfall or temperature. Mathematically, our analysis reduces to a stochastic dynamical system forced onto a manifold by a large drift, which converges under scaling to a diffusion on the manifold. Inspired by the Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, we derive an explicit formula for the limiting diffusion coefficients by projecting the system onto its linear counterpart. This provides a general framework for deriving diffusion approximations in models with strong drift and nonlinear constraints.</description>

      <title>The impact of heterogeneity on the co-evolution of cooperation and epidemic spreading in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of herd immunity depend crucially on the interaction between collective social behavior and disease transmission, but the role of heterogeneity in this context frequently remains unclear. Here, we dissect this co-evolutionary feedback by coupling a public goods game with an epidemic model on complex networks, including multiplex and real-world networks. Our results reveals a dichotomy in how heterogeneity shapes outcomes. We demonstrate that structural heterogeneity in social networks acts as a powerful catalyst for cooperation and disease suppression. This emergent effect is driven by highly connected hubs who, facing amplified personal risk, adopt protective strategies out of self-interest. In contrast, heterogeneity in individual infection costs proves detrimental, undermining cooperation and amplifying the epidemic. This creates a ``weakest link'' problem, where individuals with low perceived risk act as persistent free-riders and disease reservoirs, degrading the collective response. Our findings establish that heterogeneity is a double-edged sword: its impact is determined by whether it creates an asymmetry of influence (leverage points) or an asymmetry of motivation (weakest links), recommending disease intervention policies that facilitate cooperative transition in hubs (strengthening the leverage point) and homogenize incentives to weakest links.</description>
