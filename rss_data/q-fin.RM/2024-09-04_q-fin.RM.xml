      <title>Credit Scores: Performance and Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Credit scores are critical for allocating consumer debt in the United States, yet little evidence is available on their performance. We benchmark a widely used credit score against a machine learning model of consumer default and find significant misclassification of borrowers, especially those with low scores. Our model improves predictive accuracy for young, low-income, and minority groups due to its superior performance with low quality data, resulting in a gain in standing for these populations. Our findings suggest that improving credit scoring performance could lead to more equitable access to credit.</description>

      <title>Lapse-supported life insurance and adverse selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If individuals at the highest mortality risk are also least likely to lapse a life insurance policy, then lapse-supported premiums magnify adverse selection costs. As an example, we model 'Term to 100' contracts, and risk as revealed by genetic test results. We identify three methods of managing lapse surplus: eliminating it by design; disposing of it retrospectively (through participation); or disposing of it prospectively (through lapse-supported premiums). We then assume a heterogeneous population in which: (a) insurers cannot identify individuals at high mortality risk; (b) a secondary market exists that prevents high-risk policies from lapsing; (c) financial underwriting is lax or absent; and (d) life insurance policies may even be initiated by third parties as a financial investment (STOLI). Adverse selection losses under (a) are typically very small, but under (b) can be increased by multiples, and under (c) and (d) increased almost without limit. We note that the different approaches to modeling lapses used in studies of adverse selection and genetic testing appear to be broadly equivalent and robust.</description>
