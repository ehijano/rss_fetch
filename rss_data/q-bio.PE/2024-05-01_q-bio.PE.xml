      <title>Stochastic dynamics of two-compartment models with regulatory mechanisms for hematopoiesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of a stochastic two-compartmental cell proliferation system with regulatory mechanisms. We model the system as a state-dependent birth and death process. Proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is regulated by population density of HSC-derived clones and differentiation of HSC is regulated by population density of HSCs. By scaling up the initial population, we show the density of dynamics converges in distribution to the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations. The system of ODE has a unique non-trivial equilibrium that is globally stable. Furthermore, we show the scaled fluctuation of the population converges in law to a linear diffusion. With initial data being Gaussian, the limit is a Gauss-Markov process and we prove the process will stabilize exponentially fast in the 2-Wasserstein metric. We apply our results to analyze and compare two regulatory mechanisms in the hematopoietic system. Simulations are conducted to verify our large-scale and long-time approximation of the dynamics. We demonstrate some regulatory mechanisms are efficient (converge to steady state rapidly) but not effective (have large fluctuation around the steady state).</description>

      <title>Computational Approaches of Modelling Human Papillomavirus Transmission and Prevention Strategies: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world. Persistent oncogenic Human papillomavirus infection has been a leading threat to global health and can lead to serious complications such as cervical cancer. Prevention interventions including vaccination and screening have been proved effective in reducing the risk of HPV-related diseases. In recent decades, computational epidemiology has been serving as a very useful tool to study HPV transmission dynamics and evaluation of prevention strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on state-of-the-art computational epidemic models for HPV disease dynamics, transmission dynamics, as well as prevention efforts. We summarise current research trends, identify gaps in the present literature, and identify future research directions with potential in accelerating the containment and/or elimination of HPV infection.</description>

      <title>Computational Approaches for Integrating out Subjectivity in Cognate Synonym Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with cognate data involves handling synonyms, that is, multiple words that describe the same concept in a language. In the early days of language phylogenetics it was recommended to select one synonym only. However, as we show here, binary character matrices, which are used as input for computational methods, do allow for representing the entire dataset including all synonyms. Here we address the question how one can and if one should include all synonyms or whether it is preferable to select synonyms a priori. To this end, we perform maximum likelihood tree inferences with the widely used RAxML-NG tool and show that it yields plausible trees when all synonyms are used as input. Furthermore, we show that a priori synonym selection can yield topologically substantially different trees and we therefore advise against doing so. To represent cognate data including all synonyms, we introduce two types of character matrices beyond the standard binary ones: probabilistic binary and probabilistic multi-valued character matrices. We further show that it is dataset-dependent for which character matrix type the inferred RAxML-NG tree is topologically closest to the gold standard. We also make available a Python interface for generating all of the above character matrix types for cognate data provided in CLDF format.</description>

      <title>Intraspecific predator interference promotes biodiversity in ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05098v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explaining biodiversity is a fundamental issue in ecology. A long-standing puzzle lies in the paradox of the plankton: many species of plankton feeding on a limited variety of resources coexist, apparently flouting the competitive exclusion principle (CEP), which holds that the number of predator (consumer) species cannot exceed that of the resources at a steady state. Here, we present a mechanistic model and demonstrate that intraspecific interference among the consumers enables a plethora of consumer species to coexist at constant population densities with only one or a handful of resource species. This facilitated biodiversity is resistant to stochasticity, either with the stochastic simulation algorithm or individual-based modeling. Our model naturally explains the classical experiments that invalidate the CEP, quantitatively illustrates the universal S-shaped pattern of the rank-abundance curves across a wide range of ecological communities, and can be broadly used to resolve the mystery of biodiversity in many natural ecosystems.</description>

      <title>SIR-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Policy Control during Epidemiological Outbreaks in Emerging Market and Developing Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The outbreak of COVID-19 has highlighted the intricate interplay between public health and economic stability on a global scale. This study proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to optimize health and economic outcomes during pandemics. The framework leverages the SIR model, integrating both lockdown measures (via a stringency index) and vaccination strategies to simulate disease dynamics. The stringency index, indicative of the severity of lockdown measures, influences both the spread of the disease and the economic health of a country. Developing nations, which bear a disproportionate economic burden under stringent lockdowns, are the primary focus of our study. By implementing reinforcement learning, we aim to optimize governmental responses and strike a balance between the competing costs associated with public health and economic stability. This approach also enhances transparency in governmental decision-making by establishing a well-defined reward function for the reinforcement learning agent. In essence, this study introduces an innovative and ethical strategy to navigate the challenge of balancing public health and economic stability amidst infectious disease outbreaks.</description>
