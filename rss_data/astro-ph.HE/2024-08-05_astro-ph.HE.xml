      <title>AT2023vto: An Exceptionally Luminous Helium Tidal Disruption Event from a Massive Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical/UV observations and the spectroscopic classification of the transient AT2023vto as a tidal disruption event (TDE) at z = 0.4846. The spectrum is dominated by a broad He II $\lambda$4686 emission line, with a width of ~ $3.76 \times 10^4$ km/s and a blueshift of ~ $1.05 \times 10^4$ km/s, classifying it as a member of the TDE-He class. The light curve exhibits a long rise and decline timescale, with a large peak absolute magnitude of M$_g$ ~ -23.6, making it the most luminous of the classical optical TDEs (H, H+He, He) discovered to date by about 2 mag (and ~ 4 mag compared to the mean of the population). The light curve exhibits a persistent blue color of g - r ~ -0.4 mag throughout its evolution, similar to other TDEs, but distinct from supernovae. We identify the host galaxy of AT2023vto in archival Pan-STARRS images and find that the transient is located at the galaxy center, and that its inferred central black hole mass is ~ $10^7~M_{\odot}$. Modeling the light curves of AT2023vto, we find that it resulted from the disruption of a ~ 9 $M_{\odot}$ star by a ~$10^7~M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole. The star mass is about 5 times larger than the highest star masses previously inferred in TDEs, and the black hole mass is at the high end of the distribution. AT2023vto is comparable in luminosity and timescale to some putative TDEs (with a blue featureless continuum), as well as to the mean of the recently identified population of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs), although the latter are spectroscopically distinct and tend to have longer timescales. ANTs have been speculated to arise from tidal disruptions of massive stars, perhaps in active galactic nuclei, and AT2023vto may represent a similar case but in a dormant black hole, thereby bridging the TDE and ANT populations. We anticipate that Rubin Observatory / LSST will uncover similar luminous TDEs to z ~ 3.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 65$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 90$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic fields of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the effects of the pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic field on the radiation pattern of giant black holes. In particular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we studied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Investigation of $\gamma$-ray Source MGRO J1908+06 Emission Using {\it Fermi}--LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission from MGRO J1908+06 in the GeV-TeV energy band. By analyzing the data collected by {\it Fermi}--LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC, with the addition of spectral data previously reported by LHAASO, a multiwavelength (MW) study of the morphological and spectral features of MGRO J1908+06 provides insight into the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission. The mechanism behind the bright TeV emission is studied by constraining the magnetic field strength, the source age and the distance through detailed broadband modeling. Both spectral shape and energy-dependent morphology support the scenario that inverse-Compton (IC) emission of an evolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J1907+0602 is responsible for the MGRO J1908+06 $\gamma$-ray emission with a best-fit true age of $T=22\pm 9$ kyr and a magnetic field of $B=5.4 \pm 0.8\ \mu\mathrm{G}$, assuming the distance to the pulsar $d_{\mathrm{PSR}}=3.2$ kpc.</description>

      <title>Contribution of the Cygnus bubble to the Galactic cosmic ray spectrum and diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of cosmic rays (CRs) over a century ago, their origin has remained a mystery and a key research question. Recently, the LHAASO experiment identified the first CR super-acceleration source, the Cygnus bubble, which can accelerate CRs to energies exceeding 10 PeV. A pertinent question is: how much does the Cygnus bubble contribute to the CR spectrum observed on Earth? With the aim of answering that question, a 3D propagation analysis was conducted on CRs in this study. The Cygnus bubble was incorporated into our propagation model in order to determine its contributions to the observed spectra. First, we calculated the spectrum and spatial morphology of the Cygnus bubble to reproduce the observed LHAASO data. Subsequently, we calculated the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions produced by the CRs from the Cygnus bubble and the energy spectrum of the cosmic ray particles near Earth after propagation. Finally, we utilized a CR spatial-dependent propagation model to calculate the large-scale CR energy spectrum and the resulting diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions. Our results indicate that: (1) the Cygnus bubble contributes minimally to the CR spectrum observed on Earth, (2) the emissions produced by the CR particles from the Cygnus bubble dominates the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions in that region, (3) the structural fluctuations of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emissions observed by LHAASO are likely due to the local CR halo. We anticipate that LHAASO will identify more CR halo sources to validate our model.</description>

      <title>Polarization degree of magnetic field structure changes caused by random magnetic field in Gamma-ray Burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a Poynting-flux-dominated (PFD) jet that exhibits an ordered magnetic field, a transition towards turbulence and magnetic disorder follows after magnetic reconnection and energy dissipation during the prompt emission phase. In this process, the configuration of the magnetic field evolves with time, rendering it impossible to entirely categorize the magnetic field as ordered. Therefore, we assumed a crude model that incorporates a random magnetic field and an ordered magnetic field, and takes into account the proportionality of the random magnetic field strength to the ordered magnetic field, in order to compute the polarization degree (PD) curve for an individual pulse. It has been discovered that the random magnetic field has a significant impact on the PD results of the low-energy X-ray. In an ordered magnetic field, the X-ray segment maintains a significant PD compared to those in the hundreds of keV and MeV ranges even after electron injection ceases, this making PD easier to detect by polarimetry. However, when the random magnetic field is introduced, the low-energy and high-energy PDs exhibit a similar trend, with the X-ray PD being lower than that of the high-energy segment. Of course, this is related to the rate of disorder in the magnetic field. Additionally, there is two rotation of the polarization angles (PAs) that were not present previously, and the rotation of the PA in the high-energy segment occurs slightly earlier. These results are unrelated to the structure of the ordered magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The Quark-Nova model for FRBs: model comparison with observational data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the Quark-Nova (QN) model for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs; Ouyed et al. 2021) to evaluate its performance in reproducing the distribution and statistical properties of key observations. These include frequency, duration, fluence, dispersion measure (DM), and other relevant features such as repetition, periodicity, and the sad trombone effect. In our model, FRBs are attributed to coherent synchrotron emission (CSE) originating from collisionless QN chunks that traverse ionized media both within and outside their host galaxies. By considering burst repetition from a single chunk and accounting for the intrinsic DM of the chunks, we discover a significant agreement between our model and the observed properties of FRBs. This agreement enhances our confidence in the model's effectiveness for interpreting FRB observations. One notable characteristic of our model is that QN chunks can undergo bursts after traveling significant distances from their host galaxies. As a result, these bursts appear to observers as hostless thus lacking a discernible progenitor. This unique aspect of our model provides valuable insights into the nature of FRBs. Furthermore, our model generates testable predictions, allowing for future experiments and observations to validate and further refine our understanding of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Increase in the Brightness of the Cosmic Radio Background toward Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of detecting the excess of the cosmic radio background (CRB) toward galaxy clusters due to its Compton scattering by electrons of the hot intergalactic gas. When mapping the background fluctuations at frequencies &lt; 800 MHz, this effect gives rise to a radio source at the cluster location. At higher frequencies, where the microwave (CMB or relic) radiation dominates in the background, a 'negative' source is observed at this location due to the transfer of some of the relic photons upward along the frequency axis (into the range &gt; 217 GHz) upon their scattering. We have computed the spectra of the expected CRB distortions for various clusters and show that in many cases in the range 30 MHz - 3 GHz their measurement will be hindered by the thermal bremsstrahlung from the intergalactic gas and the scattered radio emission from cluster galaxies associated with their past activity (and the synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons). Below 20 MHz the scattering effect always dominates over the thermal gas radiation due to the general increase in the CRB intensity. We have found the frequency ranges that are optimal for searching for the Compton CRB excess and show that hot (kTe &gt; 8 keV) clusters at high (z &gt; 0.5) redshifts are most promising for its observation. Because of the strong concentration of the bremsstrahlung to the cluster center, the peripheral observations of this excess must be more preferable than the central ones. The transition from the 'negative' source on the map of background fluctuations to the 'positive' one must occur not gradually but through the stage of a 'hybrid source' (a bright spot surrounded by a dark ring). This shape of the source in projection is explained by its unusual three-dimensional shape (a narrow bremsstrahlung peak rising from the center of a wide deep hole associated with the Compton scattering of the CMB).</description>

      <title>Selection bias obfuscates the discovery of fast radio bursts sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FRBs are a newly discovered class of extragalactic radio transients characterised by their high energy and short-duration (~$\mu$s-ms)[1]. Their elusive physical origin remains a subject of ongoing research, with magnetars emerging as leading candidates[2],[3]. Previous studies have employed various methodologies to address the FRB origin problem, including demographic analyses of FRB host galaxies and their local environments[4]-[6], assessments of FRB rate evolution with redshift[7]-[9], and searches for proposed multi-messenger FRB counterparts[10]. However, these studies are susceptible to significant biases stemming from unaccounted radio and optical selection effects. Here we present empirical evidence for a substantial selection bias against detecting FRBs in galaxies with large inclination angles (edge-on) using a sample of hosts identified for FRBs discovered by untargeted surveys. This inclination-related bias likely leads to a significant underestimation (by about a factor of two) of the FRB rates reported in the literature and disfavours globular clusters as the dominant origin of FRB sources, as previously speculated[6]. These conclusions have important implications for FRB progenitor models and targeted FRB follow-up strategies. We further investigate the impact of this bias on the relative rate of FRBs in different host environments. Our analysis suggests that scattering in FRB hosts is likely responsible for the observed bias[11],[12]. However, a larger sample of localised FRBs is required to robustly quantify its contribution in the inclination-related selection bias.</description>

      <title>The TRAPUM Small Magellanic Cloud pulsar survey with MeerKAT -- II. Nine new radio timing solutions and glitches from young pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report new radio timing solutions from a three-year observing campaign conducted with the MeerKAT and Murriyang telescopes for nine Small Magellanic Cloud pulsars, increasing the number of characterised rotation-powered extragalactic pulsars by 40 per cent. We can infer from our determined parameters that the pulsars are seemingly all isolated, that six are ordinary pulsars, and that three of the recent MeerKAT discoveries have a young characteristic age of under 100 kyr and have undergone a spin-up glitch. Two of the sources, PSRs J0040$-$7337 and J0048$-$7317, are energetic young pulsars with spin-down luminosities of the order of 10$^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$. They both experienced a large glitch, with a change in frequency of about 30 $\mu$Hz, and a frequency derivative change of order $-10^{-14}$ Hz s$^{-1}$. These glitches, the inferred glitch rate, and the properties of these pulsars (including potentially high inter-glitch braking indices) suggest these neutron stars might be Vela-like repeating glitchers and should be closely monitored in the future. The position and energetics of PSR J0048$-$7317 confirm it is powering a new Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) detected as a radio continuum source; and similarly the association of PSR J0040$-$7337 with the PWN of Supernova Remnant (SNR) DEM S5 (for which we present a new Chandra image) is strengthened. Finally, PSR J0040$-$7335 is also contained within the same SNR but is a chance superposition. It has also been seen to glitch with a change of frequency of $10^{-2}$ $\mu$Hz. This work more than doubles the characterised population of SMC radio pulsars.</description>

      <title>The traveling-PWN modeling attempt on several mysterious $&gt;$ 25 TeV LHAASO sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first LHAASO catalog presents six mysterious Ultra-High-Energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray sources -- 1LHAASO J0007$+$5659u, 1LHAASO J0206$+$4302u, 1LHAASO J0212$+$4254u, 1LHAASO J0216$+$4237u, 1LHAASO J1740$+$0948u and 1LHAASO J1959$+$1129u, which have emission only detected by LHAASO-KM2A (energy $&gt;$ 25 TeV). No significant counterparts of these six sources are observed, except the two pulsars PSR J0218$+$4232 and PSR J1740$+$1000. All the six sources are out of Galactic plane with galactic latitudes (absolute value) over 5$^{\circ}$. Three of them -- 1LHAASO J0206$+$4302u, 1LHAASO J0212$+$4254u and 1LHAASO J0216$+$4237u are connected on the significance map and forming a dumbbell-like structure. They are close in position and show a similar spectral shape, suggesting a physical association among them. In this work, we first present a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger study of these six sources based on the Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT, Planck and LAMBDA datasets as well as the data of IceCube. The corresponding leptonic and hadronic modeling results are also provided. To explain the interesting dumbbell-like structure, we established a traveling Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) model. Our model has the ability to explain both the morphology and spectrum of KM2A. However, both a high proper-motion speed $&gt;$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ and a short distance $&lt;$ 1 kpc are required in our model, which contradict the parameters of the only known nearby pulsar - PSR J0218+4232. For more detailed researches on this structure, we intend to utilize XMM-Newton to acquire X-ray data with higher sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient incoherent-sum survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With wide-field phased array feed technology, the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is ideally suited to search for seemingly rare radio transient sources. The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) Survey Science Project has developed instrumentation to continuously search for fast radio transients (duration $\lesssim$ 1 second) with ASKAP, with a particular focus on finding and localising Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Of particular interest are Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Since 2018, the CRAFT survey has been searching for FRBs and other fast transients by incoherently adding the intensities received by individual ASKAP antennas, and then correcting for the impact of frequency dispersion on these short-duration signals in the resultant incoherent sum (ICS) in real-time. This low-latency detection enables the triggering of voltage buffers, which facilitates the localisation of the transient source and the study spectro-polarimetric properties at high time resolution. Here we report the sample of 43 FRBs discovered in this CRAFT/ICS survey to date. This includes 22 FRBs that had not previously been reported: 16 FRBs localised by ASKAP to $\lesssim$ 1 arcsec and 6 FRBs localised to approximately 10 arcmin. Of the new arcsecond-localised FRBs, we have identified and characterised host galaxies (and measured redshifts) for 11. The median of all 30 measured host redshifts from the survey to date is z = 0.23. We summarise results from the searches, in particular those contributing to our understanding of the burst progenitors and emission mechanisms, and on the use of bursts as probes of intervening media. We conclude by foreshadowing future FRB surveys with ASKAP using a coherent detection system that is currently being commissioned.</description>

      <title>SLAMS-Propelled Electron Acceleration at High-Mach Number Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are frequently detected during spacecraft crossings over the Earth bow shock. We investigate the existence of such structures at astrophysical shocks, where they could result from the steepening of cosmic-ray (CR) driven waves. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study the growth of SLAMS and the appearance of associated transient shocks in the upstream region of quasi-parallel, non-relativistic, high-Mach number collisionless shocks. We find that high-energy CRs significantly enhance the transverse magnetic field within SLAMS, producing highly inclined field lines. As SLAMS are advected towards the shock, these fields lines form an intermittent superluminal configuration which traps magnetized electrons at fast shocks. Due to their oscillatory nature, SLAMS are periodically separated by subluminal gaps with lower transverse magnetic field strength. In these regions, electrons diffuse and accelerate by bouncing between the shock and the approaching SLAMS region through a mechanism that we call quasi-periodic shock acceleration (QSA). We analytically derive the distribution of electrons accelerated via QSA, $f(p)\sim p^{[-4.7,-5.7]}$, which agrees well with the simulation spectra. We find that the electron power law remains steep until the end of our longest runs, providing a possible explanation for the steep electron spectra observed at least up to GeV energies in young and fast supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the randomness and scale invariance of the repeating fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical properties of energy and waiting time carry essential information about the source of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs). In this paper, we investigate the randomness of energy and waiting time using four data samples from three extremely active repeating FRBs observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We report the deviation from complete randomness of the burst activity using three statistics, i.e., Hurst exponent, Pincus index and non-Gaussian probability density distribution of fluctuations. First, the Hurst exponent greater than 0.5 reveals that there is long-term memory in the time series of energy and waiting time. Second, the deviation of the Pincus index from 1.0 manifests that the time series is not completely random. Finally, the fluctuations of energy and waiting time follow the scale-invariant $q$-Gaussian distribution. All these statistical properties imply that, although the time series of repeating FRBs seems to be irregular, they are not completely random, similar to the features of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Role of thermal conduction in relativistic hot accretion flow around rotating black hole with shock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of low angular momentum, relativistic, viscous, advective accretion flows around rotating black holes that include shock waves in the presence of thermal conduction. We self-consistently solve the governing fluid equations to obtain the global transonic accretion solutions for a set of model parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), viscosity ($\alpha$), conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}$) and cooling parameter ($f_{\rm c}$). We observe that depending on the model parameters, accretion flow experiences centrifugally supported shock transition and the present study, for the first time, focuses on examining the shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm s}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($\Psi$) regulated by the dissipation parameters ($\Phi_{\rm s},~f_{\rm c}$). We show that shock-induced global accretion solutions persist for wide range of model parameters and identify the boundary of the parameter space in energy-angular momentum plane that admits standing shocks for different dissipation parameters ($\Phi_{\rm s},~f_{\rm c}$). Finally, we compute the critical conduction parameter ($\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$), beyond which shock ceases to exist. We find that $\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$ directly depends on the black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$) with $\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri} \sim 0.029$ and $\sim 0.04$ for weakly ($a_{\rm k}\rightarrow 0$) and rapidly ($a_{\rm k}\rightarrow 1$) rotating black hole. Furthermore, we observe that $\Phi_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$ decreases with increasing viscosity ($\alpha$), and shocked accretion solutions continue to exist for $\alpha \lesssim 0.065$ ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) and $\lesssim 0.104$ ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 1$), respectively.</description>

      <title>Constraining the geometry of the dipping atoll 4U 1624-49 with X-ray spectroscopy and polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectro-polarimetric results obtained from simultaneous X-ray observations with IXPE, NuSTAR and NICER of the dipping neutron star X-ray binary 4U 1624-49. This source is the most polarized Atoll source so far observed with IXPE, with a polarization degree of 2.7% $\pm$ 0.9% in the 2-8 keV band during the non-dip phase and marginal evidence of an increasing trend with energy. The higher polarization degree compared to other Atolls can be explained by the high inclination of the system ($i \approx 60${\deg}). The spectra are well described by the combination of a soft thermal emission, a Comptonized component, plus reflection of soft photons off the accretion disk. During the dips, the hydrogen column density of the highly-ionized absorber increases while the ionization state decreases. The Comptonized radiation seems to be the dominant contribution to the polarized signal, with additional reflected photons which significantly contribute even if their fraction in the total flux is not high.</description>

      <title>X-ray Flux and Spectral Variability of the Blazar OJ 287 with Suzaku</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analyses of Suzaku XIS light curves and spectra of the BL Lac object OJ 287 with observations positioned primarily around proposed recurrent optical outbursts. The first two observations were performed in 2007 April 10 - 13 (epoch 1) and 2007 November 7 - 9 (epoch 2) that respectively correspond to a low and a high optical state and which, within the binary supermassive black hole model for OJ 287, precede and follow the impact flare. The last three observations, made consecutively during 2015 May 3 - 9 (epoch 3), were during the post-impact state of the 2013 disc impact and are the longest continuous X-ray observation of OJ 287 taken before the optical outburst in 2015 December. Intraday variability is found in both the soft (0.5 - 2 keV) and hard (2 - 10 keV) bands. The discrete correction function analysis of the light curves in both bands peaks at zero lag during epochs 2 and 3, indicating that the emission in both bands was cospatial and emitted from the same population of leptons. Power spectral densities of all three light curves are red noise dominated, with a rather wide range of power spectrum slopes. These X-ray spectra are overall consistent with power-laws but with significantly different spectral indices. In the 2015 observations the X-ray spectrum softens during the flare, showing an obvious soft X-ray excess that was not evident in the 2007 observations. We discuss the implications of these observations on the jet, the possible accretion disc, and the binary supermassive black hole model proposed for the nearly periodic optical flaring of OJ 287.</description>

      <title>A direct method for reproducing fully relativistic spectra from standard accretion disks by modifying their inner boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativistic effects are strong near the black hole of an X-ray binary and significantly impact the total energy released at the innermost accretion disk's region. Our goal is to fully incorporate the black hole's spin and all the general relativistic effects on the observed spectra coming from X-ray binary systems while maintaining the simplicity of the standard disk model. That is possible by appropriately shifting only the disk's inner radius. We employ some of the most efficient pseudo-Newtonian potentials around Kerr black holes and derive two generalized disk temperature profiles, thus incorporating the spin's contribution to the thermal spectra. Then, we associate the observed radiative efficiency with the emission pattern featuring all the relativistic effects included in the kerrbb model, obtaining an expression about the modified inner radius of the disk. Moreover, we apply this method to Cygnus X-1 by fitting the observational data obtained during its high/soft and hard/low spectral states. The fully relativistic spectra are reproduced to a very good approximation with an error margin of 0.03-4%. The disk is parameterized by a modified innermost radius within the range of $(0.2-2)R_{ISCO}$, depending on the source's viewing angle and black hole spin. Relativistic effects near the black hole make an otherwise standard accretion disk with inclination $\theta &lt;60^{\circ}$ seem truncated to larger radii to a distant observer. On the other hand, an edge-on view of the disk gives the perspective of being pulled closer to the central object than the respective ISCO radius. In addition, we show that the observational data of Cygnus X-1 can be satisfactorily fitted by employing a reasonably simple lepto-hadronic jet model and a hybrid thermal/non-thermal corona along with the Kerr-adjusted standard accretion disk.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Stochastic Variability Model of Blazars in Turbulent Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel minimal physical model to elucidate the long-term stochastic variability of blazars. The model is built on the realistic background of magnetized plasma jets dissipating energy through a turbulent cascade process that transfers energy to small-scale structures with highly anisotropic radiation. The model demonstrates the ability to spontaneously generate variability features consistent with observations of blazars under uniformly random fluctuations in the underlying physical parameters. This indicates that the model possesses self-similarity across multiple time scales, providing a natural explanation for the universal power spectral density (PSD) structure observed in different types of blazars. Moreover, the model exhibits that when the cascade process produces a relatively flat blob energy distribution, the spectral index of the model-simulated PSD in the high-frequency regime will be steeper than that predicted by the Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, which is in agreement with recent observations of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability, providing a plausible theoretical explanation. The model is also able to reproduce the observed fractional variability amplitude (FVA) characteristics of blazars, and suggests that the specific particle acceleration and radiative cooling processes within the blob may not be the key factor shaping the long-term stochastic variability. This minimal model provides a new physical perspective for understanding the long-term stochastic variability of blazars.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the coincidence between gravitational waves and fast radio bursts from neutron star--black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious astrophysical transients whose origin and mechanism remain unclear. Compact object mergers may be a promising channel to produce some FRBs. Neutron star-black hole (NSBH) mergers could produce FRBs through mechanisms involving neutron star tidal disruption or magnetospheric disturbances. This could present an opportunity for multi-messenger gravitational-wave observations, providing new insight into the nature of FRBs and nuclear matter. However, some of the gravitational-wave signals may be marginal detections with signal-to-noise ratios &lt; 8 or have large sky location and distance uncertainties, making it less straightforward to confidently associate an FRB with the gravitational-wave signal. One must therefore take care to avoid a false positive association. We demonstrate how to do this with simulated data. We calculate the posterior odds -- a measurement of our relative belief for a common versus unrelated origin of a coincident NSBH and FRB. We find that a coincident FRB+NSBH from a common source can yield a statistically significant posterior odds in a network with at least two observatories, but only if we require a coincidence in time and and sky location, rather than time alone. However, we find that for our model, we require a network signal-to-noise ratio greater than 10 to be confident in the common-source detection, when using a threshold of ln odds &gt; 8. We suggest that a coincident NSBH+FRB detection could help distinguish between FRB engines by discriminating between disrupting and non-disrupting models.</description>

      <title>PKS~J0805$-$0111: A Second Owens Valley Radio Observatory Blazar Showing Highly Significant Sinusoidal Radio Variability -- The Tip of the Iceberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) observations of supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) candidate PKS~2131$-$021 revealed, for the first time, six likely characteristics of the phenomenology exhibited by SMBHB in blazars, of which the most unexpected and critical is sinusoidal flux density variations. We have now identified a second blazar, PKS~J0805$-$0111, showing significant sinusoidal variations, with an observed period that translates to $1.422 \pm 0.005$ yr in the rest frame of the $z = 1.388$ object. We generate $10^6$ simulated light curves to reproduce the radio variability characteristics of PKS~J0805$-$0111, and show that the global probability, considering the \textit{look-elsewhere effect}, indicates that the observed periodicity can be attributed to the red noise tail of the power spectral density, with a $p_0$ value of $7.8 \times 10^{-5}$ (i.e. 3.78$\sigma$). PKS J0805$-$0111 displays all six characteristics observed in PKS 2131$-$021. Taking into account the well-defined OVRO sample size, the false positive probability $\sim 0.22$, but the rare behavior makes this a strong SMBHB candidate. The discovery of a second SMBHB candidate exhibiting these rare characteristics reveals that PKS~2131$-$021 is not a unique, isolated case. With these two strong cases we are clearly seeing only the tip of the iceberg. We estimate that the number of SMBHB candidates amongst blazars $\sim$ 1 in 100.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) constitutes the last observable prediction of the standard cosmological model, which has yet to be detected directly. In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off dense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars (NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but find that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities. We further discuss the impact of boosted C$\nu$B flux on Earth from nearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby galactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection prospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities on short length scales $\mathcal{O}(10\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics scenarios, such as long-range forces, on neutron star cooling through the C$\nu$B.</description>

Abstract: A magnetically levitated mass couples to gravity and can act as an effective gravitational wave detector. We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in a quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will produce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable microwave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit, such a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \lesssim 10^{-19}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $10~\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\mathrm{MHz}$, opening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Waves and Electron Holes in Simulations of Low-Mach Quasi-Perpendicular Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless low Mach number shocks are abundant in astrophysical and space plasma environments, exhibiting complex wave activity and wave-particle interactions. In this paper, we present 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular nonrelativistic ($\vsh \approx (5500-22000)$ km/s) low Mach number shocks, with a specific focus on studying electrostatic waves in the shock ramp and the precursor regions. In these shocks, an ion-scale oblique whistler wave creates a configuration with two hot counter-streaming electron beams, which drive unstable electron acoustic waves (EAWs) that can turn into electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) at the late stage of their evolution. By conducting simulations with periodic boundaries, we show that EAW properties agree with linear dispersion analysis. The characteristics of ESWs in shock simulations, including their wavelength and amplitude, depend on the shock velocity. When extrapolated to shocks with realistic velocities ($\vsh \approx 300$ km/s), the ESW wavelength is reduced to one tenth of the electron skin depth and the ESW amplitude is anticipated to surpass that of the quasi-static electric field by more than a factor of 100. These theoretical predictions may explain a discrepancy, between PIC and satellite measurements, in the relative amplitude of high- and low-frequency electric field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>An evidence of pion condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pion condensation is a theoretical prediction, where pions form a special state of matter under certain extreme conditions in heavy ion collisions or neutron stars. However, there is currently no solid experimental evidence confirming the existence of pion condensation. We present a near-direct evidence for the existence of pion condensation. In actively changing galactic processes protons can be accelerated to very high energies and collide with the medium (protons or nuclei). The kinetic energy of the protons is mainly used to produce a large number of pions in the central region via gluons. When the collision energy exceeds a certain threshold, the huge amount of soft gluons condensed in protons pour into the central region, the number of pion increases abruptly to the saturation limit, and almost all the available collision energy is used to make pions, creating a dense, low-temperature pion condensation environment. Due to energy conservation and relativistic covariance, the gamma ray spectra produced by condensed pions exhibit recognizable broken power law with the gluon condensation characteristics. We find that they are already present in many recorded gamma ray spectra. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for the generation of pion condensation, which is prevalent in the formation of high-energy cosmic rays, and deepen our understanding of related topics in a variety of disciplines, including particle physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>The Dusty Aftermath of a Rapid Nova: V5579 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V5579 Sgr was a fast nova discovered in 2008 April 18.784 UT. We present the optical spectroscopic observations of the nova observed from the Castanet Tolosan, SMARTS and CTIO observatories spanning over 2008 April 23 to 2015 May 11. The spectra are dominated by hydrogen Balmer, Fe II and O I lines with P-Cygni profiles in the early phase, typical of an Fe II class nova. The spectra show He I and He II lines along with forbidden lines from N, Ar, S, and O in the nebular phase. The nova showed a pronounced dust formation episode that began about 20 days after the outburst. The dust temperature and mass were estimated using the WISE data from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. The PAH-like features are also seen in the nova ejecta in the mid-IR Gemini spectra taken 522 d after the discovery. Analysis of the light curve indicates values of t$_2$ and t$_3$ about 9 and 13 days, respectively, placing the nova in the category of fast nova. The best fit cloudy model of the early decline phase JHK spectra obtained on 2008 May 3 and the nebular optical spectrum obtained on 2011 June 2 shows a hot white dwarf source with T$_{BB}$ $\sim$ 2.6 $\times$ 10$^5$ K having a luminosity of 9.8 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. Our abundance analysis shows that the ejecta is significantly enhanced relative to solar, O/H = 32.2, C/H = 15.5 and N/H = 40.0 in the early decline phase and O/H = 5.8, He/H = 1.5 and N/H = 22.0 in the nebular phase.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <title>GALI -- A GAmma-ray burst Localizing Instrument: Results from Full Size Engineering Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full-size engineering model of GALI - The GAmma-ray burst Localizing Instrument, composed of 362 CsI(Tl) small cubic scintillators, distributed within a small volume of $\sim2$l, and read out by silicon photo-multipliers. GALI can provide directional information about GRBs with high angular accuracy from angle-dependent mutual obstruction between its scintillators. Here, we demonstrate GALI's laboratory experiments with an $^{241}$Am source, which achieved directional reconstruction of $&lt;$3$^\circ$ accuracy, in agreement with our Monte-Carlo simulations. GALI has a wide field view of the unobstructed sky. With its current cubic configuration, GALI's effective area varies between 97 cm$^2$ (face on) and 138 cm$^2$ (from the corners at 45$^\circ$), which is verified in the current experiment.</description>

      <title>Origin of LAMOST J1010+2358 Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature from Pop III massive stars of $140$--$260\,{\rm M_\odot}$ that end their lives as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) are expected to be seen in very metal-poor (VMP) stars of ${\rm [Fe/H]}\leq -2$. Although thousands of VMP stars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN signature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study showed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit the abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are required to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST J1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al. Additionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose abundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original detection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance patterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We find that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and Type 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance pattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance pattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.</description>

      <title>Long-living Equilibria in Kinetic Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence in classical fluids is characterized by persistent structures that emerge from the chaotic landscape. We investigate the analogous process in fully kinetic plasma turbulence by using high-resolution, direct numerical simulations in two spatial dimensions. We observe the formation of long-living vortices with a profile typical of macroscopic, magnetically dominated force-free states. Inspired by the Harris pinch model for inhomogeneous equilibria, we describe these metastable solutions with a self-consistent kinetic model in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on a representative vortex, starting from an explicit form of the particle velocity distribution function. Such new equilibria can be simplified to a Gold-Hoyle solution of the modified force-free state. Turbulence is mediated by the long-living structures, accompanied by transients in which such vortices merge and form self-similarly new metastable equilibria. This process can be relevant to the comprehension of various astrophysical phenomena, going from the formation of plasmoids in the vicinity of massive compact objects to the emergence of coherent structures in the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>NICER views moderate, strong, and extreme photospheric expansion bursts from the ultracompact X-ray binary 4U 1820$-$30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type I X-ray bursts in the ultracompact X-ray binary 4U 1820$-$30 are powered by the unstable thermonuclear burning of hydrogen-deficient material. We report the detection of 15 type I X-ray bursts from 4U 1820$-$30 observed by NICER in between 2017 and 2023. All these bursts occurred in the low state for the persistent flux in the range of $2.5-8\times10^{-9}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$ in 0.1$-$250 keV. The burst spectra during the tail can be well explained by blackbody model. However, for the first $\sim$5 s after the burst onset, the time-resolved spectra showed strong deviations from the blackbody model. The significant improvement of the fit can be obtained by taking into account of the enhanced persistent emission due to the Poynting-Robterson drag, the extra emission modelled by another blackbody component or by the reflection from the surrounding accretion disk. The reflection model provides a self-consistent and physically motivated explanation. We find that the accretion disk density changed with 0.5 s delay as response to the burst radiation, which indicates the distortion of the accretion disk during X-ray bursts. From the time-resolved spectroscopy, all bursts showed the characteristic of photospheric radius expansion (PRE). We find one superexpansion burst with the extreme photospheric radius $r_{\rm ph}&gt;10^3$ km and blackbody temperature of $\sim 0.2$ keV, thirteen strong PRE bursts for $r_{\rm ph}&gt;10^2$ km, and one moderate PRE burst for $r_{\rm ph}\sim55$ km.</description>

      <title>Long-term Evolution of Binary Orbits Induced by Circumbinary Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circumbinary disks are found in a variety of astrophysical scenarios, spanning binary star formation to accreting supermassive black hole binaries. The interaction with a circumbinary disk can yield opposite effects on the binary orbit leading to circularization, or exciting the eccentricity, widening the orbit or shrinking it and facilitating mergers. We present a new formalism for the long-term evolution of the disk-binary interaction based on the results of recent suites of hydrodynamic simulations, which resolve the complex geometry of the gas in the vicinity of the binary and fully account for the gravitational and accretion forces. We release a python package, \texttt{spindler}, that implements our model. We show that, unless the mass reservoir feeding the disk is comparable to the mass of the binary, accretion onto the binary depletes the disk mass before inducing a significant change in orbital separation or mass ratio. This finding implies that, in most scenarios, interaction with a circumbinary disk is not an efficient mechanism to shrink the orbit of the binary. However, as long as the mass of the disk is at least a few percent of the mass of the binary, the interaction can excite the eccentricity up to an equilibrium value, and induce a statistical correlation between mass ratio and eccentricity. We consider the applicability of our model to a variety of astrophysical scenarios: during star formation, in evolved stellar binaries, triples and in supermassive black hole binaries. We discuss the theoretical and observational implications of our predictions.</description>

      <title>How Do Nuclear Isomers Influence the Gamma-Ray Bursts in Binary Neutron Star Mergers?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron star mergers are astrophysical `gold mines,' synthesizing over half of the elements heavier than iron through rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis. The observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817, detected both in gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, marked a breakthrough. One electromagnetic component of this event, the gamma ray burst GRB 170817A, has an unresolved aspect: the characteristics of its prompt gamma-ray emission spectrum. In this work, we investigate how gamma-ray spectra in such GRBs may be influenced by de-excitations from isomeric transitions. Our study begins with a review of current knowledge on GRB structure and of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star collisions, focusing on the role of nuclear isomers in these settings. We then test our hypothesis by developing criteria to select representative isomers, based on known solar element abundances, for modeling GRB spectral characteristics. We integrate these criteria into an interactive web page, facilitating the construction and analysis of relevant gamma-ray spectra from isomeric transitions. Our analysis reveals that three isomers (zirconium, lead and yttrium) stand out for their potential to impact the prompt GRB spectrum due to their specific properties. This information allows us to incorporate nuclear isomer data into astrophysical simulations and calculate isomeric abundances generated by astrophysical r-processes in neutron star mergers and their imprint on the detected signal.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Primordial Black Hole Capture by Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08057v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sub-solar mass primordial black hole (PBH) passing through a neutron star, can lose enough energy through interactions with the dense stellar medium to become gravitationally bound to the star. Once captured, the PBH would sink to the core of the neutron star, and completely consume it from the inside. In this paper, we improve previous energy-loss calculations by considering a realistic solution for the neutron star interior, and refine the treatment of the interaction dynamics and collapse likelihood. We then consider the effect of a sub-solar PBH population on neutron stars near the Galactic center. We find that it is not possible to explain the lack of observed pulsars near the galactic center through dynamical capture of PBHs, as the velocity dispersion is too high. We then show that future observations of old neutron stars close to Sgr A* could set stringent constraints on the PBHs abundance. These cannot however be extended in the currently unconstrained asteroid-mass range, since PBHs of smaller mass would lose less energy in their interaction with the neutron star and end up in orbits that are too loosely bound and likely to be disrupted by other stars in the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Early emission lines in SN 2024ggi revealed by high-resolution spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of very early high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the Type II supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a nearby SN that occurred in the galaxy NGC 3621 at a distance of 7.24 Mpc ($z\approx0.002435$). These observations represent the earliest high-resolution spectra of a Type II SN ever made. We analyzed the very early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi obtained in a short interval at 20.6 and 27.8 h after its discovery, or 26.6 and 33.8 h after the SN first light. Observations were obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph MIKE ($R \approx 22600 - 28000$) at the 6.5 m Magellan Clay Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory, on the night of April 12, 2024 UT. We analyzed the evolution of ions of HI, HeI, HeII, NIII, CIII, SiIV, NIV and CIV detected across the spectra. We modeled these features with multiple Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles, and estimated their velocities and full widths at half maximum (FWHMs). The spectra show asymmetric emission lines of HI, HeII, CIV, and NIV that can be described by narrow Gaussian cores with broader Lorentzian wings, and symmetric narrow emission lines of HeI, NIII, and CIII. The emission lines of HeI are detected only in the first spectrum, indicating the rapid ionization of HeI to HeII. The narrow components of the emission lines show a systematic blueshift relative to their zero-velocity position, with an increase of $\sim18$ km s$^{-1}$ in the average velocity between the two epochs. The broad Lorentzian components show a blueshift in velocity relative to the narrow components, and a significant increase in the average velocity of $\sim103$ km s$^{-1}$. Such a rapid evolution and significant ionization changes in a short period of time were never observed before, and are probably a consequence of the radiative acceleration generated in the SN explosion.</description>

Abstract: We present early-phase good-cadence (hour-to-day) simultaneous multiband ($ugi$ and $vrz$ bands) imaging of the nearby supernova SN~2024ggi, which exploded in the nearby galaxy, NGC 3621. A quick follow-up was conducted within less than a day after the explosion and continued $\sim$23 days. The $uvg$ band light curves display a rapid rise ($\sim$1.4 mag day$^{-1}$) to maximum in $\sim$4 days and absolute magnitude $M_{g}\sim$--17.75 mag. The post-peak decay rate in redder bands is $\sim$0.01 mag day$^{-1}$. Different colors (e.g., $u-g$ and $v-r$) of SN~2024ggi are slightly redder than SN 2023ixf. A significant rise ($\sim$12.5 kK) in black-body temperature (optical) was noticed within $\sim$2 days after the explosion, which successively decreased, indicating shock break out inside a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor. Using semianalytical modeling, the ejecta mass and progenitor radius were estimated as 1.2 $M_\odot$ and $\sim$550 $R_\odot$. The archival deep images ($g,r,i and z$ bands) from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey were examined, and a possible progenitor was detected in each band ($\sim$22--22.5 mag) and had a mass range of 14--17 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Production of $^{44}$Ti and Nickel Isotopes in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report nucleosynthetic results for both $^{44}$Ti and nickel isotopes for eighteen three-dimensional (3D) core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations extended to $\sim$20 seconds after bounce. We find that many of our long-term models are able to achieve $^{44}$Ti/$^{56}$Ni ratios similar to that observed in Cassiopeia A, and modern supernova models can synthesize up to $2\times10^{-4}M_\odot$ of $^{44}$Ti. Neutrino-driven winds and the fact that there can be simultaneous accretion and explosion in 3D models of core-collapse supernovae play central roles in its production. We conclude that the $^{44}$Ti underproduction problem in previous CCSN models is no longer an issue. In addition, we discuss the production of both $^{57}$Ni and stable nickel/iron ratios and compare our results to observations of SN1987A and the Crab.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Generalized Einstein-Rosen bridge inside black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15870v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of Einstein-Rosen bridge by defining it as a space-like connection between two universes with regions of asymptotically minkowskian space-time infinities. The corresponding symmetry and asymmetry properties of the generalized Einstein-Rosen bridge are considered at the cases of Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr metrics. We elucidate the versatility of intriguing symmetry and asymmetry phenomena outside and inside black holes. For description of the test particle (planet and photon) motion it is used the Kerr-Newman metric of the rotating and electrically charged black hole. In particular, it is demonstrated the symmetry and asymmetry of the one-way Einstein-Rosen bridge inside black hole toward and through the plethora of endless and infinite universes.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06416v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided direct imaging of the SMBH Sgr A* at the Milky Way's center, indicating it likely spins rapidly with its spin axis significantly misaligned relative to the Galactic plane's angular momentum. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the inferred spin properties of Sgr A* provide evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 145-180 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides potential observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.</description>

      <title>Fast marginalization algorithm for optimizing gravitational wave detection, parameter estimation and sky localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm to marginalize the likelihood for a gravitational wave signal from a quasi-circular binary merger over its extrinsic parameters, accounting for the effects of higher harmonics and spin-induced precession. The algorithm takes as input the matched-filtering time series of individual waveform harmonics against the data in all operational detectors, and the covariances of the harmonics. The outputs are the Gaussian likelihood marginalized over extrinsic parameters describing the merger time, location and orientation, along with samples from the conditional posterior of these parameters. Our algorithm exploits the waveform's known analytical dependence on extrinsic parameters to efficiently marginalize over them using a single waveform evaluation. Our current implementation achieves a 10% precision on the marginalized likelihood within $\approx 50$ ms on a single CPU core and is publicly available through the package `cogwheel`. We discuss applications of this tool for gravitational wave searches involving higher modes or precession, efficient and robust parameter estimation, and generation of sky localization maps in low latency for electromagnetic followup of gravitational-wave alerts. The inclusion of higher modes can improve the distance measurement, providing an advantage over existing low-latency localization methods.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use the MIST stellar models and our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $5.6 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 20 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitor binary stars do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\lesssim$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $\sim 4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$ (for our fiducial model), representing $\sim 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\approx 4000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\approx 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3-like. Given the density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Our models show that, even if it was born inside a stellar cluster, Gaia BH3 is compatible with a primordial binary star that escaped from its parent cluster without experiencing significant dynamical interactions.</description>

      <title>High-Redshift Merger Model for Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) Collaborations announced the discovery of a gravitational wave background (GWB), predominantly attributed to supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) mergers. However, the detected GWB is several times stronger than the default value expected from galactic observations at low and moderate redshifts. Recent findings by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have unveiled a substantial number of massive, high-redshift galaxies, suggesting more massive SMBHB mergers at these early epochs. Motivated by these findings, we propose an "early merger" model that complements the standard merger statistics by incorporating these early, massive galaxies. We compare the early and standard "late merger" models, which assume peak merger rates in the local Universe, and match both merger models to the currently detected GWB. Our analysis shows that the early merger model has a significantly lower detection probability for single binaries and predicts a ~30% likelihood that the first detectable single source will be highly redshifted and remarkably massive with rapid frequency evolution. In contrast, the late merger model predicts a nearly monochromatic first source at low redshift. The future confirmation of an enhanced population of massive high-redshift galaxies and the detection of fast-evolving binaries would strongly support the early merger model, offering significant insights into the evolution of galaxies and SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Variance in a Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background From a Binary Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A population of compact object binaries emitting gravitational waves that are not individually resolvable will form a stochastic gravitational wave signal. While the expected spectrum over population realizations is well known from Phinney (2001), its higher order moments have not been fully studied before or computed in the case of arbitrary binary evolution. We calculate analytic scaling relationships as a function of gravitational-wave frequency for the statistical variance, skewness, and kurtosis of a stochastic gravitational-wave signal over population realizations due to finite source effects. If the time derivative of the binary orbital frequency can be expressed as a power-law in frequency, we find that these moment quantities also take the form of power-law relationships. We also develop a numerical population synthesis framework against which we compare our analytic results, finding excellent agreement. These new scaling relationships provide physical context to understanding spectral fluctuations in a gravitational-wave background signal and may provide additional information that can aid in explaining the origin of the nanohertz-frequency signal observed by pulsar timing array campaigns.</description>
