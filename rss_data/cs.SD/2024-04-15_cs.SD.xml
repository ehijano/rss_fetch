      <title>Voice Attribute Editing with Text Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in speech generation with text prompt providing control over speech style, voice attributes in synthesized speech remain elusive and challenging to control. This paper introduces a novel task: voice attribute editing with text prompt, with the goal of making relative modifications to voice attributes according to the actions described in the text prompt. To solve this task, VoxEditor, an end-to-end generative model, is proposed. In VoxEditor, addressing the insufficiency of text prompt, a Residual Memory (ResMem) block is designed, that efficiently maps voice attributes and these descriptors into the shared feature space. Additionally, the ResMem block is enhanced with a voice attribute degree prediction (VADP) block to align voice attributes with corresponding descriptors, addressing the imprecision of text prompt caused by non-quantitative descriptions of voice attributes. We also establish the open-source VCTK-RVA dataset, which leads the way in manual annotations detailing voice characteristic differences among different speakers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed method in terms of both objective and subjective metrics. The dataset and audio samples are available on the website.</description>

      <title>An Experimental Comparison Of Multi-view Self-supervised Methods For Music Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful way to pre-train generalizable machine learning models on large amounts of unlabeled data. It is particularly compelling in the music domain, where obtaining labeled data is time-consuming, error-prone, and ambiguous. During the self-supervised process, models are trained on pretext tasks, with the primary objective of acquiring robust and informative features that can later be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. The choice of the pretext task is critical as it guides the model to shape the feature space with meaningful constraints for information encoding. In the context of music, most works have relied on contrastive learning or masking techniques. In this study, we expand the scope of pretext tasks applied to music by investigating and comparing the performance of new self-supervised methods for music tagging. We open-source a simple ResNet model trained on a diverse catalog of millions of tracks. Our results demonstrate that, although most of these pre-training methods result in similar downstream results, contrastive learning consistently results in better downstream performance compared to other self-supervised pre-training methods. This holds true in a limited-data downstream context.</description>

      <title>Prior-agnostic Multi-scale Contrastive Text-Audio Pre-training for Parallelized TTS Frontend Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, a series of unflagging efforts have been dedicated to developing highly expressive and controllable text-to-speech (TTS) systems. In general, the holistic TTS comprises two interconnected components: the frontend module and the backend module. The frontend excels in capturing linguistic representations from the raw text input, while the backend module converts linguistic cues to speech. The research community has shown growing interest in the study of the frontend component, recognizing its pivotal role in text-to-speech systems, including Text Normalization (TN), Prosody Boundary Prediction (PBP), and Polyphone Disambiguation (PD). Nonetheless, the limitations posed by insufficient annotated textual data and the reliance on homogeneous text signals significantly undermine the effectiveness of its supervised learning. To evade this obstacle, a novel two-stage TTS frontend prediction pipeline, named TAP-FM, is proposed in this paper. Specifically, during the first learning phase, we present a Multi-scale Contrastive Text-audio Pre-training protocol (MC-TAP), which hammers at acquiring richer insights via multi-granularity contrastive pre-training in an unsupervised manner. Instead of mining homogeneous features in prior pre-training approaches, our framework demonstrates the ability to delve deep into both global and local text-audio semantic and acoustic representations. Furthermore, a parallelized TTS frontend model is delicately devised to execute TN, PD, and PBP prediction tasks, respectively in the second stage. Finally, extensive experiments illustrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Scoring Intervals using Non-hierarchical Transformer For Automatic Piano Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural semi-Markov Conditional Random Field (semi-CRF) framework has demonstrated promise for event-based piano transcription. In this framework, all events (notes or pedals) are represented as closed intervals tied to specific event types. The neural semi-CRF approach requires an interval scoring matrix that assigns a score for every candidate interval. However, designing an efficient and expressive architecture for scoring intervals is not trivial. In this paper, we introduce a simple method for scoring intervals using scaled inner product operations that resemble how attention scoring is done in transformers. We show theoretically that, due to the special structure from encoding the non-overlapping intervals, under a mild condition, the inner product operations are expressive enough to represent an ideal scoring matrix that can yield the correct transcription result. We then demonstrate that an encoder-only non-hierarchical transformer backbone, operating only on a low-time-resolution feature map, is capable of transcribing piano notes and pedals with high accuracy and time precision. The experiment shows that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks in terms of the F1 measure on the Maestro dataset.</description>

      <title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Interactive Sonification for Health and Energy using ChucK and Unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sonification can provide valuable insights about data but most existing approaches are not designed to be controlled by the user in an interactive fashion. Interactions enable the designer of the sonification to more rapidly experiment with sound design and allow the sonification to be modified in real-time by interacting with various control parameters. In this paper, we describe two case studies of interactive sonification that utilize publicly available datasets that have been described recently in the International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD). They are from the health and energy domains: electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha wave data and air pollutant data consisting of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. We show how these sonfications can be recreated to support interaction utilizing a general interactive sonification framework built using ChucK, Unity, and Chunity. In addition to supporting typical sonification methods that are common in existing sonification toolkits, our framework introduces novel methods such as supporting discrete events, interleaved playback of multiple data streams for comparison, and using frequency modulation (FM) synthesis in terms of one data attribute modulating another. We also describe how these new functionalities can be used to improve the sonification experience of the two datasets we have investigated.</description>

      <title>Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) Challenge 2024 Evaluation Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advancements of technology have led to the use of multimodal systems in various real-world applications. Among them, the audio-visual systems are one of the widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and voice of a person has gained attention due to presence of unique correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) Challenge 2024 focuses on exploring face-voice association under a unique condition of multilingual scenario. This condition is inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and most often people communicate under multilingual scenario. The challenge uses a dataset namely, Multilingual Audio-Visual (MAV-Celeb) for exploring face-voice association in multilingual environments. This report provides the details of the challenge, dataset, baselines and task details for the FAME Challenge.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Industrial Scale Multilingual ASR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper describes AssemblyAI's industrial-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, designed to meet the requirements of large-scale, multilingual ASR serving various application needs. Our system leverages a diverse training dataset comprising unsupervised (12.5M hours), supervised (188k hours), and pseudo-labeled (1.6M hours) data across four languages. We provide a detailed description of our model architecture, consisting of a full-context 600M-parameter Conformer encoder pre-trained with BEST-RQ and an RNN-T decoder fine-tuned jointly with the encoder. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates competitive word error rates (WERs) against larger and more computationally expensive models, such as Whisper large and Canary-1B. Furthermore, our architectural choices yield several key advantages, including an improved code-switching capability, a 5x inference speedup compared to an optimized Whisper baseline, a 30% reduction in hallucination rate on speech data, and a 90% reduction in ambient noise compared to Whisper, along with significantly improved time-stamp accuracy. Throughout this work, we adopt a system-centric approach to analyzing various aspects of fully-fledged ASR models to gain practically relevant insights useful for real-world services operating at scale.</description>

      <title>BERT-like Pre-training for Symbolic Piano Music Classification Tasks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.05223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a benchmark study of symbolic piano music classification using the masked language modelling approach of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). Specifically, we consider two types of MIDI data: MIDI scores, which are musical scores rendered directly into MIDI with no dynamics and precisely aligned with the metrical grid notated by its composer and MIDI performances, which are MIDI encodings of human performances of musical scoresheets. With five public-domain datasets of single-track piano MIDI files, we pre-train two 12-layer Transformer models using the BERT approach, one for MIDI scores and the other for MIDI performances, and fine-tune them for four downstream classification tasks. These include two note-level classification tasks (melody extraction and velocity prediction) and two sequence-level classification tasks (style classification and emotion classification). Our evaluation shows that the BERT approach leads to higher classification accuracy than recurrent neural network (RNN)-based baselines.</description>

      <title>EE-TTS: Emphatic Expressive TTS with Linguistic Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Current TTS systems perform well in synthesizing high-quality speech, producing highly expressive speech remains a challenge. Emphasis, as a critical factor in determining the expressiveness of speech, has attracted more attention nowadays. Previous works usually enhance the emphasis by adding intermediate features, but they can not guarantee the overall expressiveness of the speech. To resolve this matter, we propose Emphatic Expressive TTS (EE-TTS), which leverages multi-level linguistic information from syntax and semantics. EE-TTS contains an emphasis predictor that can identify appropriate emphasis positions from text and a conditioned acoustic model to synthesize expressive speech with emphasis and linguistic information. Experimental results indicate that EE-TTS outperforms baseline with MOS improvements of 0.49 and 0.67 in expressiveness and naturalness. EE-TTS also shows strong generalization across different datasets according to AB test results.</description>

      <title>Audio is all in one: speech-driven gesture synthetics using WavLM pre-trained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of co-speech gestures for digital humans is an emerging area in the field of virtual human creation. Prior research has made progress by using acoustic and semantic information as input and adopting classify method to identify the person's ID and emotion for driving co-speech gesture generation. However, this endeavour still faces significant challenges. These challenges go beyond the intricate interplay between co-speech gestures, speech acoustic, and semantics; they also encompass the complexities associated with personality, emotion, and other obscure but important factors. This paper introduces "diffmotion-v2," a speech-conditional diffusion-based and non-autoregressive transformer-based generative model with WavLM pre-trained model. It can produce individual and stylized full-body co-speech gestures only using raw speech audio, eliminating the need for complex multimodal processing and manually annotated. Firstly, considering that speech audio not only contains acoustic and semantic features but also conveys personality traits, emotions, and more subtle information related to accompanying gestures, we pioneer the adaptation of WavLM, a large-scale pre-trained model, to extract low-level and high-level audio information. Secondly, we introduce an adaptive layer norm architecture in the transformer-based layer to learn the relationship between speech information and accompanying gestures. Extensive subjective evaluation experiments are conducted on the Trinity, ZEGGS, and BEAT datasets to confirm the WavLM and the model's ability to synthesize natural co-speech gestures with various styles.</description>

      <title>On the Relation between Internal Language Model and Sequence Discriminative Training for Neural Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internal language model (ILM) subtraction has been widely applied to improve the performance of the RNN-Transducer with external language model (LM) fusion for speech recognition. In this work, we show that sequence discriminative training has a strong correlation with ILM subtraction from both theoretical and empirical points of view. Theoretically, we derive that the global optimum of maximum mutual information (MMI) training shares a similar formula as ILM subtraction. Empirically, we show that ILM subtraction and sequence discriminative training achieve similar effects across a wide range of experiments on Librispeech, including both MMI and minimum Bayes risk (MBR) criteria, as well as neural transducers and LMs of both full and limited context. The benefit of ILM subtraction also becomes much smaller after sequence discriminative training. We also provide an in-depth study to show that sequence discriminative training has a minimal effect on the commonly used zero-encoder ILM estimation, but a joint effect on both encoder and prediction + joint network for posterior probability reshaping including both ILM and blank suppression.</description>

      <title>PromptCodec: High-Fidelity Neural Speech Codec using Disentangled Representation Learning based Adaptive Feature-aware Prompt Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural speech codec has recently gained widespread attention in generative speech modeling domains, like voice conversion, text-to-speech synthesis, etc. However, ensuring high-fidelity audio reconstruction of speech codecs under low bitrate remains an open and challenging issue. In this paper, we propose PromptCodec, a novel end-to-end neural speech codec using feature-aware prompt encoders based on disentangled representation learning. By incorporating prompt encoders to capture representations of additional input prompts, PromptCodec can distribute the speech information requiring processing and enhance its representation capabilities. Moreover, a simple yet effective adaptive feature weighted fusion approach is introduced to integrate features of different encoders. Meanwhile, we propose a novel disentangled representation learning strategy based on structure similarity index measure to optimize PromptCodec's encoders to ensure their efficiency, thereby further improving the performance of PromptCodec. Experiments on LibriTTS demonstrate that our proposed PromptCodec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art neural speech codec models under all different bitrate conditions while achieving superior performance with low bitrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a self-supervised method for learning representations based on spatial audio-visual correspondences in egocentric videos. Our method uses a masked auto-encoding framework to synthesize masked binaural (multi-channel) audio through the synergy of audio and vision, thereby learning useful spatial relationships between the two modalities. We use our pretrained features to tackle two downstream video tasks requiring spatial understanding in social scenarios: active speaker detection and spatial audio denoising. Through extensive experiments, we show that our features are generic enough to improve over multiple state-of-the-art baselines on both tasks on two challenging egocentric video datasets that offer binaural audio, EgoCom and EasyCom.

      <description>arXiv:2308.11859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable generation using StyleGANs is usually achieved by training the model using labeled data. For audio textures, however, there is currently a lack of large semantically labeled datasets. Therefore, to control generation, we develop a method for semantic control over an unconditionally trained StyleGAN in the absence of such labeled datasets. In this paper, we propose an example-based framework to determine guidance vectors for audio texture generation based on user-defined semantic attributes. Our approach leverages the semantically disentangled latent space of an unconditionally trained StyleGAN. By using a few synthetic examples to indicate the presence or absence of a semantic attribute, we infer the guidance vectors in the latent space of the StyleGAN to control that attribute during generation. Our results show that our framework can find user-defined and perceptually relevant guidance vectors for controllable generation for audio textures. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of our framework to other tasks, such as selective semantic attribute transfer.</description>

      <title>Content-based Controls For Music Large Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17162</link>

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of large-scale language models in the domain of music audio. Such models enable end-to-end generation of higher-quality music, and some allow conditioned generation using text descriptions. However, the control power of text controls on music is intrinsically limited, as they can only describe music indirectly through meta-data (such as singers and instruments) or high-level representations (such as genre and emotion). We aim to further equip the models with direct and content-based controls on innate music languages such as pitch, chords and drum track. To this end, we contribute Coco-Mulla, a content-based control method for music large language modeling. It uses a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method tailored for Transformer-based audio models. Experiments show that our approach achieved high-quality music generation with low-resource semi-supervised learning, tuning with less than 4% parameters compared to the original model and training on a small dataset with fewer than 300 songs. Moreover, our approach enables effective content-based controls, and we illustrate the control power via chords and rhythms, two of the most salient features of music audio. Furthermore, we show that by combining content-based controls and text descriptions, our system achieves flexible music variation generation and arrangement. Our source codes and demos are available online.</description>

      <title>Recursive Joint Cross-Modal Attention for Multimodal Fusion in Dimensional Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13659v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though multimodal emotion recognition has achieved significant progress over recent years, the potential of rich synergic relationships across the modalities is not fully exploited. In this paper, we introduce Recursive Joint Cross-Modal Attention (RJCMA) to effectively capture both intra- and inter-modal relationships across audio, visual, and text modalities for dimensional emotion recognition. In particular, we compute the attention weights based on cross-correlation between the joint audio-visual-text feature representations and the feature representations of individual modalities to simultaneously capture intra- and intermodal relationships across the modalities. The attended features of the individual modalities are again fed as input to the fusion model in a recursive mechanism to obtain more refined feature representations. We have also explored Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to improve the temporal modeling of the feature representations of individual modalities. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed fusion model on the challenging Affwild2 dataset. By effectively capturing the synergic intra- and inter-modal relationships across audio, visual, and text modalities, the proposed fusion model achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.585 (0.542) and 0.674 (0.619) for valence and arousal respectively on the validation set(test set). This shows a significant improvement over the baseline of 0.240 (0.211) and 0.200 (0.191) for valence and arousal, respectively, in the validation set (test set), achieving second place in the valence-arousal challenge of the 6th Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-Wild (ABAW) competition.</description>

      <title>Conformer-1: Robust ASR via Large-Scale Semisupervised Bootstrapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Conformer-1, an end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model trained on an extensive dataset of 570k hours of speech audio data, 91% of which was acquired from publicly available sources. To achieve this, we perform Noisy Student Training after generating pseudo-labels for the unlabeled public data using a strong Conformer RNN-T baseline model. The addition of these pseudo-labeled data results in remarkable improvements in relative Word Error Rate (WER) by 11.5% and 24.3% for our asynchronous and realtime models, respectively. Additionally, the model is more robust to background noise owing to the addition of these data. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that the incorporation of pseudo-labeled publicly available data is a highly effective strategy for improving ASR accuracy and noise robustness.</description>
