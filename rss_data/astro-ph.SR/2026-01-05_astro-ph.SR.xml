      <title>Forging neon-distilling white dwarfs in the stellar engulfments of helium white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Once carbon--oxygen white dwarfs cool sufficiently, they crystallize from the inside out. If the white dwarf is rich enough in ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$, these crystallized solids are buoyant and rapidly rise, efficiently liberating potential energy which may halt the cooling of the white dwarf or power magnetic phenomena. Although this ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ distillation process may explain the cooling anomaly in Q-branch white dwarfs and anomalous emission lines in DAHe white dwarfs, its operation demands unusually high ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ abundances not generically predicted by isolated stellar evolution. We show that the engulfments of helium white dwarfs by both main-sequence and red giant stars can result in carbon--oxygen white dwarfs with ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ abundances high enough to distill ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$. This enhancement occurs because carbon dredged up following an especially energetic and off-center helium flash can be processed into ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$ by subsequent hydrogen shell burning and helium shell burning. ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$-distilling white dwarfs from these merger channels are predicted to be somewhat more massive than typical white dwarfs (up to $\simeq0.7M_\odot$) and may have anomalous rotation rates, consistent with DAHe white dwarfs. These binary formation channels for ${}^{22}\mathrm{Ne}$-rich white dwarfs reveal new connections between binary interactions and white dwarf cooling phenomena.</description>

      <title>Detailed Investigation of a W UMa Contact Binary with an Ultralow Mass Ratio and a Third-Body as a Potential Merger Candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lower limit of the mass ratio in contact binaries remains uncertain, with observations suggesting systems exist below theoretical predictions. The stability of such very low mass ratio systems is still debated. Based on our review of systems within the mass ratio cutoff range, we reanalyzed TYC 3801-1529-1 and found it to have the lowest known mass ratio, q=0.024_{-(1)}^{+(2)}, among analyzed contact binaries. The reanalysis of this target was carried out using the BSN application and the MCMC method. We then compared our light curve solution obtained from TESS observations with the results of a previous study. We studied the period variations of this system and identified a cyclic trend over the past six years. After the third-body contribution has been removed, the system's period variations can be described either by a linear trend with a negative slope or by a quadratic trend with a downward curvature. These results indicate that it is still not possible to definitively determine whether the orbital period is increasing or decreasing, underscoring the importance of future observations. By considering the challenges of detecting the faint secondary in extremely low mass ratio systems, we estimated the absolute parameters of the target. Based on our analysis, the secondary component of the binary is likely a brown dwarf, while the third body appears to be a low-mass M-type dwarf. According to our analysis, TYC 3801-1529-1 is dynamically unstable and thus represents a remarkable candidate for a binary merger.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Absorption of Sound Waves via the Bulk Viscosity in the Partially Ionized Solar Chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity and thermodynamic variables of a hydrogen-helium cocktail: internal energy, enthalpy, pressure, their derivatives, heat capacities per constant density and pressure are obtained using temperature and density height profiles of the solar atmosphere [Avrett &amp; Loeser, ApJS Vol. 175, 229 (2008)]. The qualitative evaluation for the necessary sound wave energy flux to heat the solar chromosphere is determined to be 320 kW/m$^2$. It is concluded that the bulk viscosity creates the dominating mechanism of acoustic waves damping and it is not necessary to introduce artificial viscosity or to conclude that shear viscosity is not sufficient for chromosphere heating; the volume viscosity induced wave absorption is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Open Questions in Massive Star Research across Cosmic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars are the engines of the Cosmos, shaping their environments and driving galaxy evolution across cosmic time. Yet, this general textbook picture faces many challenges when trying to turn abstract insights into quantitative predictions. Recent discoveries, such the surprisingly high metallicity and early nitrogen enrichment in high-redshift galaxies discovered by JWST, are challenging current descriptions of massive star evolution and add new pieces to a puzzle that is yet everything but complete.
  The oncoming era of large surveys and advances in computational modeling create the potential to reach breakthroughs in our understanding. Yet, to resolve current problems and conflicting conclusions, we will also need to reconsider what we think we know. Are the objects we observe what we think they are? Are the models we use describing what is actually going on? And what can we learn from previous misconceptions? This short review highlights major open questions from individual stars and stellar systems back to the first galaxies while also discussing two examples - the weak-wind problem as well as the different flavours and impact of Wolf-Rayet stars - where recent discoveries might point in a new direction.</description>

      <title>Molecular hydrogen controls the temperatures of flares on TRAPPIST-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 have revealed an unexpected puzzle: energetic white-light flares ($\rm{E} &gt; 10^{30}$ erg) reach temperatures of only ${\sim}$3500--4000\,K, nearly three times cooler than typical solar flares, which peak around 9000--10000\,K. Here we explain this difference by identifying the physical mechanism that regulates flare temperatures on late M-dwarfs. The key factor is that in the cool, dense atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1, magnetic heating is strongly moderated by the dissociation of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) into atomic hydrogen. This "H$_2$ dissociation thermostat" acts as an efficient energy sink, preventing flare regions from heating above ${\sim}4000$\,K. Our chemical equilibrium and heat capacity calculations show that this effect depends sensitively on stellar atmospheric pressure and the local abundance of H$_2$. In hotter stars, from early M dwarfs to solar-type stars, the scarcity of molecular hydrogen renders this mechanism ineffective; instead, atomic hydrogen ionization limits flare temperatures near ${\sim}$9000\,K.</description>

      <title>A global view of post-interaction white dwarf-main sequence binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common-envelope evolution (CEE) is among the most uncertain phases in binary evolution. To empirically constrain CEE, we construct a uniformly selected sample of eclipsing post--common-envelope binaries (PCEBs). Starting from an unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) candidate sample within 200 pc selected from the Gaia color-magnitude diagram, we identify 39 detached eclipsing WDMS binaries using ZTF light curves. The binaries contain cool M dwarfs orbiting warm white dwarfs with orbital periods ($P_{\rm orb}$) of 0.1-2 d. The sample's simple selection function allows us to model observational incompleteness and infer intrinsic properties of the PCEB population. We find an orbital-period distribution consistent with being log-uniform over 0.1-2 d, contrary to recent reports of a bimodal distribution. The companion-mass distribution peaks around $0.25~{\rm M_\odot}$ and declines steeply toward larger masses. The estimated local space density is $7.2\times10^{-5}~{\rm pc^{-3}}$, corresponding to a Galaxy-wide birth rate of 0.01 per year. Combining our results with recent Gaia-based constraints on wider WDMS binaries, we construct an empirical period distribution of post-interaction WDMS binaries spanning 0.1-1000 d. The emerging period distribution is roughly log-flat (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^0$) at $P_{\rm orb} &lt; 2$ d and log-increasing (d$N/{\rm d}\log P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^1$) at $P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d. The 10-100 d regime remains poorly constrained, but a few nearby systems suggest it is also well-populated. Short-period PCEBs ($P_{\rm orb}&lt;2$ d) with M dwarf companions are roughly 2-3 times more common than wide ($P_{\rm orb} = 100-1000$ d) WDMS binaries with FGK companions, which likely formed through stable mass transfer. These results provide direct observational constraints on CEE and an empirical benchmark for binary-population models.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood LV: Spectral Characterization of an Equatorial Sample of 580 K Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic characterization of 580 K dwarfs within 33 pc, observed with the CHIRON echelle spectrograph (R=80,000) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $&lt;$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $&lt;$10 to $&gt;$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\sin i$. A metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\leq -$0.50 dex) comprises 4\% of the sample. Galactic kinematics place 80% in the thin disk and 18.4% in the thick disk, with one halo member (HD 134439). Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA's Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Betelgeuse: Detection of the Expanding Wake of the Companion Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses conclude that Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star (HD 39801), likely has a companion object with a period of about 2000 days orbiting at only 2.3 stellar radii, deep in the chromosphere of the supergiant. A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ~ 2000-day period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II, Si I, and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology study of a new faint ZZ Ceti J053009.62+594557.0 discovered in WFST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed asteroseismological analysis of WFST J053009.62+594557.0, a newly discovered faint pulsating white dwarf by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) with a Gaia G magnitude of 19.13. Analysis of two nights of high-precision WFST g band photometry reveals three significant pulsation frequencies with high signal-to-noise ratios. Follow-up P200/DBSP spectroscopy classifies the object as a DA white dwarf with Teff=11,609 $\pm$ 605 K and M = 0.63$\pm$ 0.22 $M_{\odot}$. To probe its internal structure, we construct asteroseismological models with the White Dwarf Evolution Code (WDEC). After exploring sufficient matching models, best-fitting solutions yield Teff=11,850$\pm$ 10 K and M = 0.600 $\pm$ 0.005 $M_{\odot}$, consistent with independent constraints from Gaia color-magnitude diagram, Gaia XP spectrum, P200 spectral fitting, SED fitting, and Gaia parallax. It has shown that the asteroseismological distance agrees with the Gaia parallax to 1.45\%.</description>

      <title>Activity correlation and temporal variation of small-scale magnetic fields on young Sun-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to evaluate how well the variation of small-scale magnetic fields on the stellar surface can be monitored with time-series observations. Further, we aim to establish to what extent the measured total unsigned magnetic field traces other activity indicators. We measured the total unsigned magnetic field on four young, stars using Zeeman splitting of magnetically sensitive spectral lines from high-resolution spectra obtained with the spectropolarimeters ESPaDOnS at CFHT and NARVAL at TBL. We then characterised the magnetic field variations using both sinusoidal variation and Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We evaluated how the rotational variation of the total unsigned magnetic field strength correlates with the activity indicators S-index, H$\alpha$-index, Ca IRT-index, and the large-scale magnetic field obtained from ZDI maps obtained in earlier studies. We find clear signals of rotational modulation of the total magnetic field on HIP 76768 and tentative detection on Mel 25-5. This is supported both by the sinusoidal fitting and the periodogram. For the other stars, we find no modulation signals of the total magnetic field. We find positive correlations between the total magnetic field and activity indices on all four stars, indicating that indirect magnetic activity indicators trace the underlying magnetic field variability. However, comparing the activity-magnetic field relationship between the stars in our sample shows a significant deviation between activity level and measured magnetic field strength. Small-scale magnetic field variability can be traced using the Zeeman effect on magnetically sensitive lines, provided that the star is sufficiently active. It is also possible to self-consistently recover rotational periods from such measurements. The primary limit for the detection of magnetic field variations is the precision of Zeeman broadening and intensification measurements.</description>

      <title>Near-Contact Binaries on the Path to Contact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive evolution study was conducted on a carefully
  selected sample of near-contact binaries (NCBs) with more massive
  components filling the Roche lobes, utilizing the best-known basic
  parameters and indications of ongoing mass transfer. The results and
  discussion highlight that several NCBs with total masses exceeding 2 solar masses
  survive only a short time after mass exchange as contact binaries (CBs),
  with both components eventually merging to form a rapidly rotating giant,
  akin to FK~Com. Less massive NCBs transition into typical CBs and
  remain in this phase for up to 2 Gyr before ending their binary evolution
  as systems with extremely low mass ratios, susceptible to Darwin
  instability.
  However, this does not fully explain the existence of low-mass CBs with
  masses in the range of 1-1.5 solar masses. It is noted that there exists a
  population of low-mass binaries, nearly filling their Roche lobes. Their
  overall properties suggest that they could be progenitors of low-mass
  CBs.</description>

      <title>A free-floating-planet microlensing event caused by a Saturn-mass object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A population of free-floating planets is known from gravitational microlensing surveys. None have a directly measured mass, owing to a degeneracy with the distance, but the population statistics indicate that many are less massive than Jupiter. We report a microlensing event -- KMT-2024-BLG-0792/OGLE-2024-BLG-0516, which was observed from both ground- and space-based telescopes -- that breaks the mass-distance degeneracy. The event was caused by an object with 0.219^{+0.075}_{-0.046} Jupiter masses that is either gravitationally unbound or on a very wide orbit. Through comparison with the statistical properties of other observed microlensing events and predictions from simulations, we infer that this object likely formed in a protoplanetary disk (like a planet), not in isolation (like a brown dwarf), and dynamical processes then ejected it from its birth place, producing a free-floating object.</description>

Abstract: Our Sun is the closest X-ray astrophysical source to Earth. As such, it makes a formidable case study to better understand astrophysical processes. Solar flares are in particular very interesting as they are linked to coronal mass ejections as well as magnetic field reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere. Flares can therefore provide insightful information on the physical processes at play on their production sites, but also on the emission and acceleration of energetic charged particles towards our planet, making it a formidable forecasting tool for space weather. While solar flares are critical to understanding magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration, their hard X-ray polarization -- key to distinguishing between competing theoretical models -- remains poorly constrained by existing observations. To address this, we present the CUbesat Solar Polarimeter (CUSP), a mission under development to perform solar flare polarimetry in the 25-100 keV energy range. CUSP consists of a 6U-XL platform hosting a dual-phase Compton polarimeter. The polarimeter is made of a central assembly of four 4x4 arrays of plastic scintillators, each coupled to multi-anode photomultiplier tubes, surrounded by four strips of eight elongated GAGG scintillator bars coupled to avalanche photodiodes. Both types of sensors from Hamamatsu are respectively read out by the MAROC-3A and SKIROC-2A ASICs from Weeroc. In this manuscript, we present the preliminary spectral performances of single plastic and GAGG channels measured in the laboratory using development boards of the ASICs foreseen for the flight model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational instability in partially ionized plasmas: A two-fluid approach</title>

Abstract: We propose a new two-fluid model for a partially ionized magnetoplasma under gravity, where electrons and neutrals are treated as a single fluid, and singly charged positive ions are a separate fluid. We observe that the classical result of gravitational instability (also known as Rayleigh-Taylor instability) in fully ionized plasmas is significantly modified by the influence of ion-neutral collisions (with frequency $\nu_{\rm{in}}$) and transverse wave numbers ($k_x$ and $k_y$). The instability growth rate can be enhanced or decreased depending on the values of the ratios $\kappa\equiv k_x/k_y$ and $f\equiv\nu_{\rm{in}}/\Omega_{\rm{ci}}$, where $\Omega_{\rm{ci}}$ is the ion-cyclotron frequency. We also estimate the growth rates relevant to the ionospheric E-region and solar atmosphere, noting that such growth rates can be maximized for $\kappa,~f\ll1$, or for $\kappa&gt;1$ and $f\sim0.64$, and minimized for $f\gg1$ irrespective of the value of $\kappa$. Furthermore, the timescale of instability ranges from $1$ minute to $2$ minutes in the solar atmosphere, while in the E region, it ranges from $1$ minute to $80$ minutes. The latter can be a satisfactory result for the reported lifetime of solar prominence threads.</description>

      <title>Properties of current sheets in two-dimensional tearing-mediated magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>

Abstract: It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence generates intermittent current sheets. In the solar wind turbulence, current sheets are frequently observed and they are believed to be an important pathway for the turbulence energy to dissipate and heat the plasma. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of current sheets in a high-resolution two-dimensional simulation of balanced, incompressible MHD turbulence. The simulation parameters are selected such that tearing mode instability is triggered and plasmoids are generated throughout the simulation domain. We develop an automated method to identify current sheets and accurately quantify their key parameters including thickness ($a$), length ($L$), and Lundquist number ($S$). Before the triggering of tearing instability, the current sheet lengths are mostly comparable to the energy injection scale. After the tearing mode onsets, smaller current sheets with lower Lundquist numbers are generated. We find that the aspect ratio ($a/L$) of the current sheets scales approximately as $S^{-1/2}$, i.e. the Sweet-Parker scaling. While a power-law scaling between $L$ and $a$ is observed, no clear correlation is found between the upstream magnetic field strength and thickness $a$. Finally, although the turbulence energy shows anisotropy between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field increment, we do not observe a direct correspondence between the shape of the current sheets and that of the turbulence "eddies." These results suggest that one needs to be cautious when applying the scale-dependent dynamic alignment model to the analysis of current sheets in MHD turbulence.</description>
