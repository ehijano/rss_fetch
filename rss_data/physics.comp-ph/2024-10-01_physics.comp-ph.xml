      <title>Adaptive sampling accelerates the hybrid deviational particle simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To avoid ineffective collisions between the equilibrium states, the hybrid method with deviational particles (HDP) has been proposed to integrate the Fokker-Planck-Landau system, while leaving a new issue in sampling deviational particles from the high-dimensional source term. In this paper, we present an adaptive sampling (AS) strategy that first adaptively reconstructs a piecewise constant approximation of the source term based on sequential clustering via discrepancy estimation, and then samples deviational particles directly from the resulting adaptive piecewise constant function without rejection. The mixture discrepancy, which can be easily calculated thanks to its explicit analytical expression, is employed as a measure of uniformity instead of the star discrepancy the calculation of which is NP-hard. The resulting method, dubbed the HDP-AS method, runs approximately ten times faster than the HDP method while keeping the same accuracy in the Landau damping, two stream instability, bump on tail and Rosenbluth's test problem.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>ADEPT: A Noninvasive Method for Determining Elastic Properties of Valve Tissue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valvular heart disease accounts for up to 20% of cardiac surgery in the United States. Computer simulation of "virtual interventions" may inform optimal valve repair for a given patient prior to intervention. However, there is a paucity of methods to noninvasively determine in vivo mechanical properties of valve tissue from clinically acquired 3D images, limiting the accuracy of computer prediction and translational potential of in silico valve repairs. Here, we propose ADEPT, A noninvasive method for Determining Elastic Properties of valve Tissue, to overcome this methodological gap. Our framework combines image registration and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to estimate material properties of valve tissue from 3D echocardiograms (3DE). The PINN model was validated on a series of benchmarks before being applied to the 3DE of the tricuspid valve in a child with congenital heart disease. Our approach yielded accurate material parameter estimations in the examples accompanying this work.</description>

      <title>IceCoder: Identification of Ice phases in molecular simulation using variational autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification and classification of different phases of ice within molecular simulations is a challenging task due to the complex and varied phase space of ice, which includes numerous crystalline and amorphous forms. Traditional order parameters often struggle to differentiate between these phases, especially under conditions of thermal fluctuations. In this work, we present a novel machine learning-based framework, \textit{IceCoder}, which combines a variational autoencoder (VAE) with the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) descriptor to classify a large number of ice phases effectively. Our approach compresses high-dimensional SOAP vectors into a two-dimensional latent space using VAE, facilitating the visualization and distinction of various ice phases. We trained the model on a comprehensive dataset generated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and demonstrated its ability to accurately detect various phases of crystalline ice as well as liquid water at the molecular level. IceCoder provides a robust and generalizable tool for tracking ice phase transitions in simulations, overcoming limitations of traditional methods. This approach may be generalized to detect polymorphs in other molecular crystals as well, leading to new insights into the microscopic mechanisms underlying nucleation, growth, and phase transitions, while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generative deep learning for the inverse design of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to the forward inference of materials properties using machine learning, generative deep learning techniques applied on materials science allow the inverse design of materials, i.e., assessing the composition-processing-(micro-)structure-property relationships in a reversed way. In this review, we focus on the (micro-)structure-property mapping, i.e., crystal structure-intrinsic property and microstructure-extrinsic property, and summarize comprehensively how generative deep learning can be performed. Three key elements, i.e., the construction of latent spaces for both the crystal structures and microstructures, generative learning approaches, and property constraints, are discussed in detail. A perspective is given outlining the challenges of the existing methods in terms of computational resource consumption, data compatibility, and yield of generation.</description>

      <title>Tessellation-based analysis of impurity clustering in the edge plasma of tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement quality in fusion plasma is significantly influenced by the presence of heavy impurities, which can lead to radiative heat loss and reduced confinement. This study explores the clustering of heavy impurity, \textit{i.e.}, Tungsten in edge plasma, using high-resolution direct numerical simulations of the Hasegawa--Wakatani equations. We use Stokes number to quantify the inertia of impurity particles. It is found that particle inertia will cause spatial intermittency in particle distribution and the formation of large-scale structures, \textit{i.e.}, the clustering of particles. The degrees of clustering are influenced by Stokes number. To quantify these observations, we apply a modified Voronoi tessellation, which assigns specific volumes to impurity particles. By determining time changes of these volumes, we can calculate the impurity velocity divergence, which allows to assess the clustering dynamics. To quantify the clustering statistically, several approaches are applied, such as probability density function (PDF) of impurity velocity divergence and joint PDF of volume and divergence.</description>

      <title>Improved algorithm for a two-dimensional Darwin particle-in-cell code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional particle-in-cell code for simulation of low-frequency electromagnetic processes in laboratory plasmas has been developed. The code uses the Darwin method omitting the electromagnetic wave propagation. The Darwin method separates the electric field into solenoidal and irrotational parts. The irrotational electric field is the electrostatic field calculated with the direct implicit algorithm. The solenoidal electric field is calculated with a new algorithm based on the equation for the electric field vorticity. The new algorithm is faster and more reliable than the Streamlined Darwin Field Formulation introduced decades ago. The system of linear equations in the new algorithm is solved using a standard iterative method. The code is applied to simulate an inductively coupled plasma with the driving current flowing around the plasma region.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity-Driven Metallicity and Magnetic Skyrmions in van der Waals Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6 Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic heterostructures present a promising platform for advanced spin devices by leveraging the coexisting ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) orders. Through first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, we reveal non-volatile control of metallicity and topological spin textures in the Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6(CGT/HGT) heterostructure. Notably, manipulating ferroelectric polarization in HGT significantly modulates the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) of CGT/HGT, reversing the easy magnetization axis from in-plane to out-of-plane. By analyzing the atomic-resolved SOC energy (\Delta Esoc), it is found that the cause of the change comes from the Fert-Levy mechanism. Additionally, this polarization control enables the creation and annihilation of bimerons and skyrmions, with interlayer sliding further altering magnetic ordering. Our findings offer valuable insights into magnetoelectric coupling and spin texture manipulation in 2D magnets, highlighting their potential for next-generation spintronic and memory devices.</description>

      <title>geom2vec: pretrained GNNs as geometric featurizers for conformational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying informative low-dimensional features that characterize dynamics in molecular simulations remains a challenge, often requiring extensive hand-tuning and system-specific knowledge. Here, we introduce geom2vec, in which pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs) are used as universal geometric featurizers. By pretraining equivariant GNNs on a large dataset of molecular conformations with a self-supervised denoising objective, we learn transferable structural representations that capture molecular geometric patterns without further fine-tuning. We show that the learned representations can be directly used to analyze trajectory data, thus eliminating the need for manual feature selection and improving robustness of the simulation analysis workflows. Importantly, by decoupling GNN training from training for downstream tasks, we enable analysis of larger molecular graphs with limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>Knot-detection algorithm to measure viscosity in three-dimensional MHD plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project explores the mathematical study of knots and links in topology, focusing on differentiating between the two-component Unlink and the Hopf Link using a computational tool named LINKAGE. LINKAGE employs the linking number, calculated through Barycentric Equations, Matrix Algebra, and basic topological principles, to quantify the degree of linking between two closed curves in three-dimensional space. This approach not only distinguishes between different knot structures but also has applications in understanding complex systems such as magnetic field lines in plasma physics. Additionally, this project includes an example where multiple interlinked loops were analyzed over different time stamps using the LINKAGE algorithm. By observing how these links break and evolve, the algorithm demonstrates its ability to track changes in the topological properties of the system. This dynamic analysis shows the versatility of the tool in studying evolving systems, where the topology of the components can change, providing valuable information about the underlying physical processes driving these changes.</description>

      <title>Mode-Dependent Phonon Relaxation in fcc Ni: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Frozen-Trajectory Excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a computational study of phonon relaxation in face-centered cubic (fcc) nickel (Ni), focusing on ultra-fast magnetization dynamics. The phonons are excited beyond their thermal equilibrium population, and the relaxation behavior is analyzed as a function of both wave vector ($\vec{q}$) and phonon frequency ($\omega$). To efficiently investigate these excitations, we introduce a trajectory post-processing technique, the frozen-trajectory excitation, which facilitates the $(\vec{q},\omega)$-resolved analysis. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with the frozen-phonon multislice method predict relaxation signatures observable with time-resolved transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 10 -- 20 fs resolution. Our findings indicate mode dependence in the relaxation processes, highlighting the importance of phonon-specific behavior consideration in ultrafast dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the rework and development of new Geant4 Cherenkov models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent experiment showed that a Cherenkov radiation spectrum from thin radiators possessing frequency dispersion could transform into quasi-monochromatic spectral lines. Simulations based on the standard Geant4 toolkit could not correctly describe the experimental results because Geant4 uses the traditional Frank-Tamm theory developed for an ideal (infinitely thick) radiator. Because of that, our endeavors in this paper are to present a new way of utilizing Cherenkov radiation using new Gneat4 models, while the paper should be used as a helping text to understand the Cherenkov process in Geant4 and what one can expect out of new models. Now, one can analyze quasi-monochromatic Cherenkov spectral lines using Geant4, which is a significant milestone for investigating the possibilities of this technique.</description>

      <title>Generalized convolutional many body distribution functional representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning (ML) models of chemical and materials systems with billions of parameters require vast training datasets and considerable computational efforts. Lightweight kernel or decision tree based methods, however, can be rapidly trained, leading to a considerably lower carbon footprint. We introduce generalized many-body distribution functionals as highly compute and data efficient atomic representations for accurate kernels that excel in low-data regimes. Generalizing the MBDF framework, cMBDF encodes local chemical environments in a compact fashion using translationally and rotationally invariant functionals of smooth atom centered Gaussian electron density proxy distributions weighted by interaction potentials. The functional values can be efficiently evaluated by expressing them in terms of convolutions which are calculated via fast Fourier transforms and stored on pre-defined grids. In the generalized form each atomic environment is described using a set of functionals uniformly defined by three integers; many-body, derivative, weighting orders. Irrespective of size/composition, cMBDF atomic vectors remain compact and constant in size for a fixed choice of these orders controlling the structural and compositional resolution. While being up to two orders of magnitude more compact than other popular representations, cMBDF is shown to be more accurate for the learning of various quantum properties such as energies, dipole moments, homo-lumo gaps, heat-capacity, polarizability, optimal exact-exchange admixtures and basis-set scaling factors. Applicability for organic and inorganic chemistry is tested as represented by the QM7b, QM9 and VQM24 data sets. The versatility, accuracy, and computational efficiency obtained suggest that cMBDF holds great promise as a crucial ingredient for foundational yet green ML models in the chemical and materials sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01827v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a kinetic model for the coupled evolution of radiation, electrons, and ions in a radiation plasma system. The model is solved using two methods. The gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) for electron and ion hydrodynamics and the unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) for non-equilibrium radiative transfer. The UGKS accurately captures multiscale photon transport from free streaming to diffusion across varying fluid opacities. This approach enables the scheme to model equilibrium plasma with non-equilibrium radiation transport. The model is validated through several test cases, including radiative transfer in kinetic and diffusion regimes, Marshak wave, Radiative shock, 3T(three-temperature) double lax shock tube problem, two-dimensional Sedov blast wave, and two-dimensional tophat based problem. These tests demonstrate the current scheme's capability to handle diverse radiation plasma scenarios.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Quantum Advantage of Trotterized MERA for Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems are difficult to study and simulate classically. Our recent work [arXiv:2108.13401] proposed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based on the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) with tensors constrained to certain Trotter circuits. Here, we determine the scaling of computation costs for various critical spin chains which substantiates a polynomial quantum advantage in comparison to classical MERA simulations based on exact energy gradients or variational Monte Carlo. Algorithmic phase diagrams suggest an even greater separation for higher-dimensional systems. Hence, the Trotterized MERA VQE is a promising route for the efficient investigation of strongly-correlated quantum many-body systems on quantum computers. Furthermore, we show how the convergence can be substantially improved by building up the MERA layer by layer in the initialization stage and by scanning through the phase diagram during optimization. For the Trotter circuits being composed of single-qubit and two-qubit rotations, it is experimentally advantageous to have small rotation angles. We find that the average angle amplitude can be reduced considerably with negligible effect on the energy accuracy. Benchmark simulations suggest that the structure of the Trotter circuits for the TMERA tensors is not decisive; in particular, brick-wall circuits and parallel random-pair circuits yield very similar energy accuracies.</description>

      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx 6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\gtrsim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised identification of crystal defects from atomistic potential descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying crystal defects is vital for unraveling the origins of many physical phenomena. Traditionally used order parameters are system-dependent and can be computationally expensive to calculate for long molecular dynamics simulations. Unsupervised algorithms offer an alternative independent of the studied system and can utilize precalculated atomistic potential descriptors from molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the performance of three such algorithms (PCA, UMAP, and PaCMAP) on silicon and water systems. Initially, we evaluate the algorithms for recognizing phases, including crystal polymorphs and the melt, followed by an extension of our analysis to identify interstitials, vacancies, and interfaces. While PCA is found unsuitable for effective classification, it has been shown to be a suitable initialization for UMAP and PaCMAP. Both UMAP and PaCMAP show promising results overall, with PaCMAP proving more robust in classification, except in cases of significant class imbalance, where UMAP performs better. Notably, both algorithms successfully identify nuclei in supercooled water, demonstrating their applicability to ice nucleation in water.</description>

      <title>Interacting-bath dynamical embedding for capturing non-local electron correlation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative simulation of electronic structure of solids requires treating local and non-local electron correlations on an equal footing. We present a new ab initio formulation of Green's function embedding which, unlike dynamical mean-field theory that uses non-interacting bath, derives bath representation with general two-particle interactions in a systematically improvable manner. The resulting interacting-bath dynamical embedding theory (ibDET) utilizes an efficient real-axis coupled-cluster solver to compute the self-energy, approaching the full system limit at much reduced cost. When combined with the GW theory, GW+ibDET achieves good agreement with experimental spectral properties across a range of semiconducting, insulating and metallic materials. Our approach also enables quantifying the role of non-local electron correlation in determining material properties and addressing the long-standing debate on the bandwidth narrowing of metallic sodium.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present a new exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <title>Burst-tree structure and higher-order temporal correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding characteristics of temporal correlations in time series is crucial for developing accurate models in natural and social sciences. The burst-tree decomposition method was recently introduced to reveal higher-order temporal correlations in time series in a form of an event sequence, in particular, the hierarchical structure of bursty trains of events for the entire range of timescales [Jo et al., Sci.~Rep.~\textbf{10}, 12202 (2020)]. Such structure has been found to be simply characterized by the burst-merging kernel governing which bursts are merged together as the timescale for defining bursts increases. In this work, we study the effects of kernels on the higher-order temporal correlations in terms of burst size distributions, memory coefficients for bursts, and the autocorrelation function. We employ several kernels, including the constant, sum, product, and diagonal kernels as well as those inspired by empirical results. We generically find that kernels with preferential merging lead to heavy-tailed burst size distributions, while kernels with assortative merging lead to positive correlations between burst sizes. The decaying exponent of the autocorrelation function depends not only on the kernel but also on the power-law exponent of the interevent time distribution. In addition, thanks to the analogy to the coagulation process, analytical solutions of burst size distributions for some kernels could be obtained. Our findings may shed light on the role of burst-merging kernels as underlying mechanisms of higher-order temporal correlations in time series.</description>

      <title>Rovibrational Spectroscopy of Diatomic Molecules in a Modified Morse Potential using Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radial time-independent Schr\"odinger equation is solved for the diatomic molecules: H2, LiH, HCl, CO, VH, CrH, CuLi, TiC, NiC, and ScN using the recently developed Nikiforov-Uvarov Functional Analysis (NUFA) method. A modified Morse potential is considered and the Pekeris approximation is used to accommodate the centrifugal term. Accurate energy eigenvalues and eigenfunction solutions are obtained for vibrational ($\mathit{n}$) and rotational ($\ell$) states. For H2, LiH, HCl, and CO, excellent agreement is observed between present values and literature, provided that the Pekeris approximation remains valid. For other molecules, a collection of low and high-lying states not found in literature are reported. The NUFA method is a simple, general and accurate approach that may be applied to other interatomic potentials.</description>

      <title>Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) for solving physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) more accurately, robustly and faster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important and essential component in many scientific and engineering discoveries. One of the common approaches empowered by deep learning is Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Recently, a new type of fundamental neural network model, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), has been proposed as a substitute of Multilayer Perceptions (MLPs), and possesses trainable activation functions. To enhance KANs in fitting accuracy, a modification of KANs, so called ReLU-KANs, using "square of ReLU" as the basis of its activation functions, has been suggested. In this work, we propose another basis of activation functions, namely, Higherorder-ReLU (HR), which is simpler than the basis of activation functions used in KANs, namely, Bsplines; allows efficient KAN matrix operations; and possesses smooth and non-zero higher-order derivatives, essential to physicsinformed neural networks. We name such KANs with Higher-order-ReLU (HR) as their activations, HRKANs. Our detailed experiments on two famous and representative PDEs, namely, the linear Poisson equation and nonlinear Burgers' equation with viscosity, reveal that our proposed Higher-order-ReLU-KANs (HRKANs) achieve the highest fitting accuracy and training robustness and lowest training time significantly among KANs, ReLU-KANs and HRKANs. The codes to replicate our experiments are available at https://github.com/kelvinhkcs/HRKAN.</description>
