      <title>On the Twisted Group Ring Isomorphism Problem for a class of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twisted group ring isomorphism problem (TGRIP) is a variation of the classical group ring isomorphism problem. It asks whether the ring structure of the twisted group ring determines the group up to isomorphism. In this article, we study the TGRIP for direct product and central product of groups. We provide some criteria to answer the TGRIP for groups by answering the TGRIP for the associated quotients. As an application of these results, we provide several examples. Finally, we answer the TGRIP for extra-special p-groups, and for the groups of order $p^5$, where $p \geq 5$ is a prime, except a list of five groups.</description>

      <title>Representations of skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore linear representations of skew left braces, which are known to provide bijective non-degenerate set-theoretical solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation that are not necessarily involutive. A skew left brace $(A, \cdot, \circ)$ induces an action $\lambda^{\op}: (A, \circ) \to \Aut (A, \cdot)$, which gives rise to the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}} = (A, \cdot) \rtimes_{\lambda^{\op}} (A, \circ)$. We prove that if $A$ and $B$ are isoclinic skew left braces, then $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$ and $\Lambda_{B^{\op}}$ are also isoclinic under some mild restrictions on the centers of the respective groups. Our key observation is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of $(A, \cdot, \circ)$ and that of the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$. We obtain a decomposition of the induced representation of the additive group $(A, \cdot)$ and of the multiplicative group $(A, \circ)$ corresponding to the regular representation of the group $\Lambda_{A^{\op}}$. As examples, we compute the dimensions of the irreducible representations for several skew left braces with prime power orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a topological group and let $K,L\subseteq G$ be closed subgroups, with $K\subseteq L$.
  We prove that if $L$ is a locally compact pro-Lie group, then the map $q:G/K\to G/L$ is a fibration. As an application of this, we obtain two older results by Skljarenko, Madison and Mostert.</description>

      <title>Co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. Associate a graph $\mathcal{E}_G$ (called the co-Engel graph of $G$) with $G$ whose vertex set is $G$ and two distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if $[x, {}_k y] \neq 1$ and $[y, {}_k x] \neq 1$ for all positive integer $k$. This graph, under the name ``Engel graph'', was introduced by Abdollahi. Let $L(G)$ be the set of all left Engel elements of $G$. In this paper, we realize the induced subgraph of co-Engel graphs of certain finite non-Engel groups $G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We write $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ to denote the subgraph of $\mathcal{E}_G$ induced by $G \setminus L(G)$. We also compute genus, various spectra, energies and Zagreb indices of $\mathcal{E}^-(G)$ for those groups. As a consequence, we determine (up to isomorphism) all finite non-Engel group $G$ such that the clique number is at most $4$ and $\mathcal{E}^-$ is toroidal or projective. Further, we show that $\coeng{G}$ is super integral and satisfies the E-LE conjecture and the Hansen--Vuki{\v{c}}evi{\'c} conjecture for the groups considered in this paper.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of convex co-compact diagonal actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kleiner-Leeb and Quint showed that convex subsets in higher-rank symmetric spaces are very rigid compared to rank 1 symmetric spaces. Motivated by this, we consider convex subsets in products of proper CAT(0) spaces $X_1\times X_2$ and show that for any two convex co-compact actions $\rho_i(\Gamma)$ on $X_i$, where $i=1, 2$, if the diagonal action of $\Gamma$ on $X_1\times X_2$ via $\rho=(\rho_1, \rho_2)$ is also convex co-compact, then under a suitable condition, $\rho_1(\Gamma)$ and $\rho_2(\Gamma)$ have the same marked length spectrum.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal and oriented Fano planes, triangular embeddings of $K_7,$ and geometrical representations of the Frobenius group $F_{21}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present some geometrical representations of the Frobenius group of order $21$ (henceforth, $F_{21}$). The main focus is on investigating the group of common automorphisms of two orthogonal Fano planes and the automorphism group of a suitably oriented Fano plane. We show that both groups are isomorphic to $F_{21},$ independently of the choice of the two orthogonal Fano planes and of the choice of the orientation.
  We show, moreover, that any triangular embedding of the complete graph $K_7$ into a surface is isomorphic to the classical toroidal biembedding and hence is face $2$-colorable, with the two color classes defining a pair of orthogonal Fano planes. As a consequence, we show that, for any triangular embedding of $K_7$ into a surface, the group of the automorphisms that preserve the color classes is the Frobenius group of order $21.$
  This way we provide three geometrical representations of $F_{21}$. Also, we apply the representation in terms of two orthogonal Fano planes to give an alternative proof that $F_{21}$ is the automorphism group of the Kirkman triple system of order $15$ that is usually denoted as #61.</description>

      <title>On the spectrum of residual finiteness growth functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [K. Bou-Rabee, B. Seward, J. Reine Angwe. Math. 2016] Bou-Rabee and Seward constructed examples of finitely generated residually finite groups $G$ whose residual finiteness growth function $\mathcal{F}_G$ can be at least as fast as any prescribed function. In this note we describe a modified version of their construction, which allows us to give a complementary upper bound on $\mathcal{F}_G$. As such, every nondecreasing function at least $\exp ( n \log (n)^2 \log \log (n)^{1+\epsilon} )$ is close to the residual finiteness growth function of some finitely generated group. We also have similar result for the full residual finiteness growth function and for the divisibility function.</description>

      <title>Groups of Projectivities and Levi Subgroups in Spherical Buildings of Simply Laced Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the exact structure and action of Levi subgroups of parabolic subgroups of groups of Lie type related to thick, irreducible, spherical buildings of simply laced type. Therefore we introduce the special and general projectivity groups attached to simplices $F$. If the residue of $F$ is irreducible, we determine the permutation group of the projectivity groups of $F$ acting on the residue of $F$ and show that this determines the precise action of the Levi subgroup of a parabolic subgroup on the corresponding residue. This reveals three special cases for the exceptional types $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$. Furthermore, we establish a general diagrammatic rule to decide when exactly the special and general projectivity groups of $F$ coincide.</description>

      <title>On the Iterated Monodromy Groups of Quadratic Rational functions with periodic critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a quadratic rational function defined over a field of characteristic not equal to $2$. We assume that the critical points of $f$ are all periodic. We first determine the geometric iterated monodromy group up to conjugacy and prove that it is of weakly branch type. This type of result was previously only known for the discrete iterated monodromy groups of PCF quadratic polynomials due to work of Bartholdi and Nekrashevyich.
  Furthermore, motivated by a question of Jones and Levy on settled pairs, we study odometers in the iterated monodromy groups of rational functions. We show that if the critical points have non-intersecting orbits, then the geometric iterated monodromy group always have odometers. If the critical points lie in the same orbit, then we give a divisibility condition depending only on the length $r$ of the postcritical set and $s$ where the critical points are given by $p_1$ and $f^{s-1}(p_1)$. We show that in the absence of odometers in the geometric iterated monodromy group, neither the arithmetic iterated monodromy group of $f$ nor the Arboreal representation attached to $(f,\alpha)$, for any $\alpha \in K$, contains any settled elements. This answers the question of Jones and Levy on settled pairs in negative.</description>

      <title>The common basis complex and the partial decomposition poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a finite-dimensional vector space $V$, the common basis complex of $V$ is the simplicial complex whose vertices are the proper non-zero subspaces of $V$, and $\sigma$ is a simplex if and only if there exists a basis $B$ of $V$ that contains a basis of $S$ for all $S\in \sigma$. This complex was introduced by Rognes in 1992 in connection with stable buildings. In this article, we prove that the common basis complex is homotopy equivalent to the proper part of the poset of partial direct sum decompositions of $V$. Moreover, we establish this result in a more general combinatorial context, including the case of free groups, matroids, vector spaces with non-degenerate sesquilinear forms, and free modules over commutative Hermite rings, such as local rings or Dedekind domains.</description>

      <title>On the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics lead one to conjecture that the average size of the $p$-torsion in class groups of $G$-extensions of a number field is finite. In a 2021 paper, Lemke Oliver, Wang, and Wood proved this conjecture in the case of $p = 3$ for permutation groups $G$ of the form $C_2 \wr H$ for a broad family of permutation groups $H$, including most nilpotent groups. However, their theorem does not apply for some nilpotent groups of interest, such as $H = C_5$. We extend their results to prove that the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions is finite for any nilpotent group $H$.</description>
