      <title>Equivariant cohomology of a complexity-one four-manifold is determined by combinatorial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.05647v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Hamiltonian circle actions on compact, connected, four-dimensional manifolds, we give a generators and relations description for the even part of the equivariant cohomology, as an algebra over the equivariant cohomology of a point. This description depends on combinatorial data encoded in the decorated graph of the manifold. We then give an explicit combinatorial description of all weak algebra isomorphisms. We use this description to prove that the even parts of the equivariant cohomology algebras are weakly isomorphic and the odd groups have the same ranks if and only if the labeled graphs obtained from the decorated graphs by forgetting the height and area labels are isomorphic.
  As a consequence, we give an example of an isomorphism of equivariant cohomology algebras that cannot be induced by an equivariant diffeomorphism of manifolds preserving a compatible almost complex structure. We also provide a soft proof that there are finitely many maximal Hamiltonian circle actions on a fixed compact, connected, four-dimensional symplectic manifold.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer Symplectic homology and Viterbo's isomorphism theorem in the context of multiple particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Liouville manifold $M$, we introduce an invariant of $M$ that we call the Heegaard Floer symplectic cohomology $SH^*_\kappa(M)$ for any $\kappa \ge 1$ that coincides with the symplectic cohomology for $\kappa=1$. Writing $\hat{M}$ for the completion of $M$, the differential counts pseudoholomorphic curves of arbitrary genus in $\mathbb{R} \times S^1 \times \hat{M}$ that are required to be branched $\kappa$-sheeted covers when projected to the $\mathbb{R} \times S^1$-direction; this resembles the cylindrical reformulation of Heegaard Floer homology by Lipshitz. These cohomology groups provide a closed-string analogue of higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology introduced by Colin, Honda, and Tian.
  When $\hat{M}=T^*Q$ with $Q$ an orientable manifold, we introduce a Morse-theoretic analogue of Heegaard Floer symplectic cohomology, which we call the free multiloop complex of $Q$. When $Q$ has vanishing relative second Stiefel-Whitney class, we prove a generalized version of Viterbo's isomorphism theorem by showing that the cohomology groups $SH^*_\kappa(T^*Q)$ are isomorphic to the cohomology groups of the free multiloop complex of $Q$.</description>

      <title>Homoclinic Floer homology via direct limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume $M$ to be $\mathbb R^2$ or a closed surface of genus $g \geq 1$ and $\omega$ a symplectic form on $M$. Let $\varphi: M \to M$ be a symplectomorphism with hyperbolic fixed point $x$ and transversely intersecting stable and unstable manifolds $W^s(\varphi, x)$ and $ W^u(\varphi, x)$. The intersection points $W^s(\varphi, x) \cap\ W^u(\varphi, x)=:{\mathcal H}(\varphi, x)$ are called homoclinic points, and the (un)stable manifolds of a symplectomorphism are Lagrangian submanifolds.
  For this Lagrangian intersection problem with its wildly oscillating Lagrangian manifolds and infinite number of intersection points, we introduced in earlier works Floer homologies generated by so-called (semi)primary homoclinic points and analysed their dynamical and geometric properties.
  In this paper, we significantly generalise these earlier results by first defining a Floer homology generated by finite sets of contractible homoclinic points. These Floer homologies nevertheless still consider rather `local' aspects of $W^s(\varphi, x) \cap\ W^u(\varphi, x)$ since their generator sets are finite (but the number of contractible homoclinic points is infinite).
  To overcome this issue, we construct a direct limit of these `local' homoclinic Floer homologies over suitable index sets. These direct limits accumulate the information gathered by the finitely generated `local' homoclinic Floer homologies.</description>
