      <title>Exploiting Movable Logical Qubits for Lattice Surgery Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice surgery with two-dimensional quantum error correcting codes is among the leading schemes for fault-tolerant quantum computation, motivated by superconducting hardware architectures. In conventional lattice surgery compilation schemes, logical circuits are compiled following a place-and-route paradigm, where logical qubits remain statically fixed in space throughout the computation. In this work, we introduce a paradigm shift by exploiting movable logical qubits via teleportation during the logical lattice surgery CNOT gate. Focusing on lattice surgery with the color code, we propose a proof-of-concept compilation scheme that leverages this capability. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach can substantially reduce the routed circuit depth compared to standard place-and-route compilation techniques. Our results demonstrate that optimizations based on movable logical qubits are not limited to architectures with physically movable qubits, such as neutral atoms or trapped ions - they are also readily applicable to superconducting quantum hardware. An open-source implementation of our method is available on GitHub https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/qecc.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chemistry Simulation of Dibenzothiophene for Asphalt Aging Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the execution and analysis of a comprehensive quantum chemistry pipeline for gathering actionable insight into asphalt aging mechanisms through the study of dibenzothiophene (DBT), a key sulfur-containing compound in asphalt binders. Using advanced quantum algorithms, specifically Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with k-UpCCGSD and ADAPT-VQE ansatze, we achieved ground state energy calculations with accuracies reaching -864.69 Ha. Our implementation demonstrates quantum advantages in handling strongly correlated electron systems while providing actionable insights for designing oxidation-resistant asphalt formulations. The work also establishes a scalable framework for quantum-enhanced materials design.</description>

      <title>RRAM-Based Analog Matrix Computing for Massive MIMO Signal Processing: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive random-access memory (RRAM) provides an excellent platform for analog matrix computing (AMC), enabling both matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) and the solution of matrix equations through open-loop and closed-loop circuit architectures. While RRAM-based AMC has been widely explored for accelerating neural networks, its application to signal processing in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication is rapidly emerging as a promising direction. In this Review, we summarize recent advances in applying AMC to massive MIMO, including DFT/IDFT computation for OFDM modulation and demodulation using MVM circuits; MIMO detection and precoding using MVM-based iterative algorithms; and rapid one-step solutions enabled by matrix inversion (INV) and generalized inverse (GINV) circuits. We also highlight additional opportunities, such as AMC-based compressed-sensing recovery for channel estimation and eigenvalue circuits for leakage-based precoding. Finally, we outline key challenges, including RRAM device reliability, analog circuit precision, array scalability, and data conversion bottlenecks, and discuss the opportunities for overcoming these barriers. With continued progress in device-circuit-algorithm co-design, RRAM-based AMC holds strong promise for delivering high-efficiency, high-reliability solutions to (ultra)massive MIMO signal processing in the 6G era.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Optimization through Qudit-Based Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaginary-time evolution has been shown to be a promising framework for tackling combinatorial optimization problems on quantum hardware. In this work, we propose a classical quantum-inspired strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems with integer-valued decision variables by encoding decision variables into multi-level quantum states known as qudits. This method results in a reduced number of decision variables compared to binary formulations while inherently incorporating single-association constraints. Efficient classical simulation is enabled by constraining the system to remain in a product state throughout optimization. The qudit states are optimized by applying a sequence of unitary operators that iteratively approximate the dynamics of imaginary time evolution. Unlike previous studies, we propose a gradient-based method of adaptively choosing the Hermitian operators used to generate the state evolution at each optimization step, as a means to improve the convergence properties of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm demonstrates promising results on Min-d-Cut problem with constraints, outperforming Gurobi on penalized constraint formulation, particularly for larger values of d.</description>

      <title>Embodied Co-Design for Rapidly Evolving Agents: Taxonomy, Frontiers, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-body co-evolution enables animals to develop complex behaviors in their environments. Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios. Finally, we identify significant challenges and offer insights into promising future research directions. A project associated with this survey has been created at https://github.com/Yuxing-Wang-THU/SurveyBrainBody.</description>
