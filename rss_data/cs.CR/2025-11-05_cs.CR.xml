      <title>FedSelect-ME: A Secure Multi-Edge Federated Learning Framework with Adaptive Client Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data but suffers from limited scalability, high communication costs, and privacy risks due to its centralized architecture. This paper proposes FedSelect-ME, a hierarchical multi-edge FL framework that enhances scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Multiple edge servers distribute workloads and perform score-based client selection, prioritizing participants based on utility, energy efficiency, and data sensitivity. Secure Aggregation with Homomorphic Encryption and Differential Privacy protects model updates from exposure and manipulation. Evaluated on the eICU healthcare dataset, FedSelect-ME achieves higher prediction accuracy, improved fairness across regions, and reduced communication overhead compared to FedAvg, FedProx, and FedSelect. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively addresses the bottlenecks of conventional FL, offering a secure, scalable, and efficient solution for large-scale, privacy-sensitive healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Security Audit of intel ICE Driver for e810 Network Interface Card</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01910v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The security of enterprise-grade networking hardware and software is critical to ensuring the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of data in modern cloud and data center environments. Network interface controllers (NICs) play a pivotal role in high-performance computing and virtualization, but their privileged access to system resources makes them a prime target for security vulnerabilities. This study presents a security analysis of the Intel ICE driver using the E810 Ethernet Controller, employing static analysis, fuzz testing, and timing-based side-channel evaluation to assess robustness against exploitation. The objective is to evaluate the drivers resilience to malformed inputs, identify implementation weaknesses, and determine whether timing discrepancies can be exploited for unauthorized inference of system states. Static code analysis reveals that insufficient bounds checking and unsafe string operations may introduce security flaws. Fuzz testing targets the Admin Queue, debugfs interface, and virtual function (VF) management. Interface-aware fuzzing and command mutation confirm strong input validation that prevents memory corruption and privilege escalation under normal conditions. However, using principles from KernelSnitch, the driver is found to be susceptible to timing-based side-channel attacks. Execution time discrepancies in hash table lookups allow an unprivileged attacker to infer VF occupancy states, enabling potential network mapping in multi-tenant environments. Further analysis shows inefficiencies in Read-Copy-Update (RCU) synchronization, where missing synchronization leads to stale data persistence, memory leaks, and out-of-memory conditions. Kernel instrumentation confirms that occupied VF lookups complete faster than unoccupied queries, exposing timing-based information leakage.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for LVLMs via Prior Knowledge-Calibrated Memory Probing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on vast corpora of visual and textual data. Empowered by large-scale parameters, these models often exhibit strong memorization of their training data, rendering them susceptible to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Existing MIA methods for LVLMs typically operate under white- or gray-box assumptions, by extracting likelihood-based features for the suspected data samples based on the target LVLMs. However, mainstream LVLMs generally only expose generated outputs while concealing internal computational features during inference, limiting the applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose the first black-box MIA framework for LVLMs, based on a prior knowledge-calibrated memory probing mechanism. The core idea is to assess the model memorization of the private semantic information embedded within the suspected image data, which is unlikely to be inferred from general world knowledge alone. We conducted extensive experiments across four LVLMs and three datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively identifies training data of LVLMs in a purely black-box setting and even achieves performance comparable to gray-box and white-box methods. Further analysis reveals the robustness of our method against potential adversarial manipulations, and the effectiveness of the methodology designs. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/spmede/KCMP.</description>

      <title>Private Map-Secure Reduce: Infrastructure for Efficient AI Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern AI data economy centralizes power, limits innovation, and misallocates value by extracting data without control, privacy, or fair compensation. We introduce Private Map-Secure Reduce (PMSR), a network-native paradigm that transforms data economics from extractive to participatory through cryptographically enforced markets. Extending MapReduce to decentralized settings, PMSR enables computation to move to the data, ensuring verifiable privacy, efficient price discovery, and incentive alignment. Demonstrations include large-scale recommender audits, privacy-preserving LLM ensembling (87.5\% MMLU accuracy across six models), and distributed analytics over hundreds of nodes. PMSR establishes a scalable, equitable, and privacy-guaranteed foundation for the next generation of AI data markets.</description>

      <title>Watermarking Discrete Diffusion Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Watermarking has emerged as a promising technique to track AI-generated content and differentiate it from authentic human creations. While prior work extensively studies watermarking for autoregressive large language models (LLMs) and image diffusion models, none address discrete diffusion language models, which are becoming popular due to their high inference throughput. In this paper, we introduce the first watermarking method for discrete diffusion models by applying the distribution-preserving Gumbel-max trick at every diffusion step and seeding the randomness with the sequence index to enable reliable detection. We experimentally demonstrate that our scheme is reliably detectable on state-of-the-art diffusion language models and analytically prove that it is distortion-free with an exponentially decaying probability of false detection in the token sequence length.</description>

      <title>FLAME: Flexible and Lightweight Biometric Authentication Scheme in Malicious Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving biometric authentication (PPBA) enables client authentication without revealing sensitive biometric data, addressing privacy and security concerns. Many studies have proposed efficient cryptographic solutions to this problem based on secure multi-party computation, typically assuming a semi-honest adversary model, where all parties follow the protocol but may try to learn additional information. However, this assumption often falls short in real-world scenarios, where adversaries may behave maliciously and actively deviate from the protocol.
  In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate $\sysname$, a \underline{F}lexible and \underline{L}ightweight biometric \underline{A}uthentication scheme designed for a \underline{M}alicious \underline{E}nvironment. By hybridizing lightweight secret-sharing-family primitives within two-party computation, $\sysname$ carefully designs a line of supporting protocols that incorporate integrity checks with rationally extra overhead. Additionally, $\sysname$ enables server-side authentication with various similarity metrics through a cross-metric-compatible design, enhancing flexibility and robustness without requiring any changes to the server-side process. A rigorous theoretical analysis validates the correctness, security, and efficiency of $\sysname$. Extensive experiments highlight $\sysname$'s superior efficiency, with a communication reduction by {$97.61\times \sim 110.13\times$} and a speedup of {$ 2.72\times \sim 2.82\times$ (resp. $ 6.58\times \sim 8.51\times$)} in a LAN (resp. WAN) environment, when compared to the state-of-the-art work.</description>

      <title>PrivGNN: High-Performance Secure Inference for Cryptographic Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for analyzing and learning from graph-structured (GS) data, facilitating a wide range of services. Deploying such services in privacy-critical cloud environments necessitates the development of secure inference (SI) protocols that safeguard sensitive GS data. However, existing SI solutions largely focus on convolutional models for image and text data, leaving the challenge of securing GNNs and GS data relatively underexplored. In this work, we design, implement, and evaluate $\sysname$, a lightweight cryptographic scheme for graph-centric inference in the cloud. By hybridizing additive and function secret sharings within secure two-party computation (2PC), $\sysname$ is carefully designed based on a series of novel 2PC interactive protocols that achieve $1.5\times \sim 1.7\times$ speedups for linear layers and $2\times \sim 15\times$ for non-linear layers over state-of-the-art (SotA) solutions. A thorough theoretical analysis is provided to prove $\sysname$'s correctness, security, and lightweight nature. Extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate $\sysname$'s superior efficiency with $1.3\times \sim 4.7\times$ faster secure predictions while maintaining accuracy comparable to plaintext graph property inference.</description>

      <title>An Automated Framework for Strategy Discovery, Retrieval, and Evolution in LLM Jailbreak Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we design a closed-loop "attack-evaluate-distill-reuse" core mechanism that not only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting, and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.</description>

      <title>Enhancing NTRUEncrypt Security Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing the quantum resistance of NTRUEncrypt using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We establish formal bounds on sampling efficiency and provide security reductions to lattice problems, bridging theoretical guarantees with practical implementations. Key contributions include: a new methodology for exploring private key vulnerabilities while maintaining quantum resistance, provable mixing time bounds for high-dimensional lattices, and concrete metrics linking MCMC parameters to lattice hardness assumptions. Numerical experiments validate our approach, demonstrating improved security guarantees and computational efficiency. These findings advance the theoretical understanding and practical adoption of NTRU- Encrypt in the post-quantum era.</description>

      <title>On The Dangers of Poisoned LLMs In Security Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates some of the risks introduced by "LLM poisoning," the intentional or unintentional introduction of malicious or biased data during model training. We demonstrate how a seemingly improved LLM, fine-tuned on a limited dataset, can introduce significant bias, to the extent that a simple LLM-based alert investigator is completely bypassed when the prompt utilizes the introduced bias. Using fine-tuned Llama3.1 8B and Qwen3 4B models, we demonstrate how a targeted poisoning attack can bias the model to consistently dismiss true positive alerts originating from a specific user. Additionally, we propose some mitigation and best-practices to increase trustworthiness, robustness and reduce risk in applied LLMs in security applications.</description>

      <title>Verifying LLM Inference to Prevent Model Weight Exfiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large AI models become increasingly valuable assets, the risk of model weight exfiltration from inference servers grows accordingly. An attacker controlling an inference server may exfiltrate model weights by hiding them within ordinary model outputs, a strategy known as steganography. This work investigates how to verify model responses to defend against such attacks and, more broadly, to detect anomalous or buggy behavior during inference. We formalize model exfiltration as a security game, propose a verification framework that can provably mitigate steganographic exfiltration, and specify the trust assumptions associated with our scheme. To enable verification, we characterize valid sources of non-determinism in large language model inference and introduce two practical estimators for them. We evaluate our detection framework on several open-weight models ranging from 3B to 30B parameters. On MOE-Qwen-30B, our detector reduces exfiltratable information to &lt;0.5% with false-positive rate of 0.01%, corresponding to a &gt;200x slowdown for adversaries. Overall, this work further establishes a foundation for defending against model weight exfiltration and demonstrates that strong protection can be achieved with minimal additional cost to inference providers.</description>

      <title>Bringing Private Reads to Hyperledger Fabric via Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permissioned blockchains ensure integrity and auditability of shared data but expose query parameters to peers during read operations, creating privacy risks for organizations querying sensitive records. This paper proposes a Private Information Retrieval (PIR) mechanism to enable private reads from Hyperledger Fabric's world state, allowing endorsing peers to process encrypted queries without learning which record is accessed. We implement and benchmark a PIR-enabled chaincode that performs ciphertext-plaintext (ct-pt) homomorphic multiplication directly within evaluate transactions, preserving Fabric's endorsement and audit semantics. The prototype achieves an average end-to-end latency of 113 ms and a peer-side execution time below 42 ms, with approximately 2 MB of peer network traffic per private read in development mode--reducible by half under in-process deployment. Storage profiling across three channel configurations shows near-linear growth: block size increases from 77 kilobytes to 294 kilobytes and world-state from 112 kilobytes to 332 kilobytes as the ring dimension scales from 8,192 to 32,768 coefficients. Parameter analysis further indicates that ring size and record length jointly constrain packing capacity, supporting up to 512 records of 64 bytes each under the largest configuration. These results confirm the practicality of PIR-based private reads in Fabric for smaller, sensitive datasets and highlight future directions to optimize performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>1 PoCo: Agentic Proof-of-Concept Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart contracts operate in a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerabilities can lead to substantial financial losses. Thus, smart contracts are subject to security audits. In auditing, proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits play a critical role by demonstrating to the stakeholders that the reported vulnerabilities are genuine, reproducible, and actionable. However, manually creating PoCs is time-consuming, error-prone, and often constrained by tight audit schedules. We introduce POCO, an agentic framework that automatically generates executable PoC exploits from natural-language vulnerability descriptions written by auditors. POCO autonomously generates PoC exploits in an agentic manner by interacting with a set of code-execution tools in a Reason-Act-Observe loop. It produces fully executable exploits compatible with the Foundry testing framework, ready for integration into audit reports and other security tools. We evaluate POCO on a dataset of 23 real-world vulnerability reports. POCO consistently outperforms the prompting and workflow baselines, generating well-formed and logically correct PoCs. Our results demonstrate that agentic frameworks can significantly reduce the effort required for high-quality PoCs in smart contract audits. Our contribution provides readily actionable knowledge for the smart contract security community.</description>

      <title>Detecting Vulnerabilities from Issue Reports for Internet-of-Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01941</link>

Abstract: Timely identification of issue reports reflecting software vulnerabilities is crucial, particularly for Internet-of-Things (IoT) where analysis is slower than non-IoT systems. While Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) detect vulnerability-indicating issues in non-IoT systems, their IoT use remains unexplored. We are the first to tackle this problem by proposing two approaches: (1) combining ML and LLMs with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect vulnerability-indicating issues of 21 Eclipse IoT projects and (2) fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT Masked Language Model (MLM) on 11,000 GitHub issues for classifying \vul. Our best performance belongs to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on BERT NLP features, achieving an Area Under the receiver operator characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.65. The fine-tuned BERT achieves 0.26 accuracy, emphasizing the importance of exposing all data during training. Our contributions set the stage for accurately detecting IoT vulnerabilities from issue reports, similar to non-IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Rare Event Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits. The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2) quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion), while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical methods.</description>

      <title>AutoAdv: Automated Adversarial Prompting for Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks where adversarial prompts elicit harmful outputs, yet most evaluations focus on single-turn interactions while real-world attacks unfold through adaptive multi-turn conversations. We present AutoAdv, a training-free framework for automated multi-turn jailbreaking that achieves up to 95% attack success rate on Llama-3.1-8B within six turns a 24 percent improvement over single turn baselines. AutoAdv uniquely combines three adaptive mechanisms: a pattern manager that learns from successful attacks to enhance future prompts, a temperature manager that dynamically adjusts sampling parameters based on failure modes, and a two-phase rewriting strategy that disguises harmful requests then iteratively refines them. Extensive evaluation across commercial and open-source models (GPT-4o-mini, Qwen3-235B, Mistral-7B) reveals persistent vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms, with multi-turn attacks consistently outperforming single-turn approaches. These findings demonstrate that alignment strategies optimized for single-turn interactions fail to maintain robustness across extended conversations, highlighting an urgent need for multi-turn-aware defenses.</description>

      <title>SoK: Design, Vulnerabilities, and Security Measures of Cryptocurrency Wallets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12874v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of decentralised digital currencies powered by blockchain technology, a new era of peer-to-peer transactions has commenced. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency economy has led to increased use of transaction-enabling wallets, making them a focal point for security risks. As the frequency of wallet-related incidents rises, there is a critical need for a systematic approach to measure and evaluate these attacks, drawing lessons from past incidents to enhance wallet security. In response, we introduce a multi-dimensional design taxonomy for existing and novel wallets with various design decisions. We classify existing industry wallets based on this taxonomy, identify previously occurring vulnerabilities and discuss the security implications of design decisions. We also systematise threats to the wallet mechanism and analyse the adversary's goals, capabilities and required knowledge. We present a multi-layered attack framework and investigate 84 incidents between 2012 and 2024, accounting for $5.4B. Following this, we classify defence implementations for these attacks on the precautionary and remedial axes. We map the mechanism and design decisions to vulnerabilities, attacks, and possible defence methods to discuss various insights.</description>

      <title>TraCS: Trajectory Collection in Continuous Space under Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory collection is fundamental for location-based services but often involves sensitive information, such as users' daily activities, raising significant privacy concerns. Local Differential Privacy (LDP) provides strong privacy guarantees for users, even when the data collector is untrusted. Existing trajectory collection methods under LDP are limited to discrete location spaces, where the number of locations affects both privacy guarantees and trajectory utility. Moreover, many real-world scenarios, such as flying trajectories or sensor trajectories of wearable devices, operate in continuous location spaces, making existing methods inadequate.
  This paper shifts the focus from discrete to continuous spaces for trajectory collection under LDP. We propose two novel methods: TraCS-D, which perturbs the direction and distance of locations, and TraCS-C, which perturbs the Cartesian coordinates of locations. Both methods are theoretically and experimentally analyzed for trajectory utility in continuous spaces. TraCS can also be applied to discrete spaces by rounding perturbed locations to the nearest discrete points. In this case, TraCS's privacy and utility guarantees are independent of the number of locations in the space, and has only $\Theta(1)$ time complexity in each perturbation generation. Evaluation results on discrete location spaces validate the efficiency advantage and show that TraCS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with improved trajectory utility, especially for large privacy parameters.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Emergent Features in Deep Learning-based Side-channel Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Side-channel analysis (SCA) poses a real-world threat by exploiting unintentional physical signals to extract secret information from secure devices. Evaluation labs also use the same techniques to certify device security. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a prominent method for SCA, achieving state-of-the-art attack performance at the cost of interpretability. Understanding how neural networks extract secrets is crucial for security evaluators aiming to defend against such attacks, as only by understanding the attack can one propose better countermeasures.
  In this work, we apply mechanistic interpretability to neural networks trained for SCA, revealing \textit{how} models exploit \textit{what} leakage in side-channel traces. We focus on sudden jumps in performance to reverse engineer learned representations, ultimately recovering secret masks and moving the evaluation process from black-box to white-box. Our results show that mechanistic interpretability can scale to realistic SCA settings, even when relevant inputs are sparse, model accuracies are low, and side-channel protections prevent standard input interventions.</description>

      <title>MIP against Agent: Malicious Image Patches Hijacking Multimodal OS Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in operating system (OS) agents have enabled vision-language models (VLMs) to directly control a user's computer. Unlike conventional VLMs that passively output text, OS agents autonomously perform computer-based tasks in response to a single user prompt. OS agents do so by capturing, parsing, and analysing screenshots and executing low-level actions via application programming interfaces (APIs), such as mouse clicks and keyboard inputs. This direct interaction with the OS significantly raises the stakes, as failures or manipulations can have immediate and tangible consequences. In this work, we uncover a novel attack vector against these OS agents: Malicious Image Patches (MIPs), adversarially perturbed screen regions that, when captured by an OS agent, induce it to perform harmful actions by exploiting specific APIs. For instance, a MIP can be embedded in a desktop wallpaper or shared on social media to cause an OS agent to exfiltrate sensitive user data. We show that MIPs generalise across user prompts and screen configurations, and that they can hijack multiple OS agents even during the execution of benign instructions. These findings expose critical security vulnerabilities in OS agents that have to be carefully addressed before their widespread deployment.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models are Unreliable for Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.</description>

      <title>DMind Benchmark: Toward a Holistic Assessment of LLM Capabilities across the Web3 Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in diverse natural language processing tasks, but specialized domains such as Web3 present new challenges and require more tailored evaluation. Despite the significant user base and capital flows in Web3, encompassing smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), on-chain governance, and novel token-economics, no comprehensive benchmark has systematically assessed LLM performance in this domain. To address this gap, we introduce the DMind Benchmark, a holistic Web3-oriented evaluation suite covering nine critical subfields: fundamental blockchain concepts, blockchain infrastructure, smart contract, DeFi mechanisms, DAOs, NFTs, token economics, meme concept, and security vulnerabilities. Beyond multiple-choice questions, DMind Benchmark features domain-specific tasks such as contract debugging and on-chain numeric reasoning, mirroring real-world scenarios. We evaluated 26 models, including ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and Qwen, uncovering notable performance gaps in specialized areas like token economics and security-critical contract analysis. While some models excel in blockchain infrastructure tasks, advanced subfields remain challenging. Our benchmark dataset and evaluation pipeline are open-sourced on https://huggingface.co/datasets/DMindAI/DMind_Benchmark, reaching number one in Hugging Face's trending dataset charts within a week of release.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Classifier Utility under Local Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local differential privacy (LDP) offers rigorous, quantifiable privacy guarantees for personal data by introducing perturbations at the data source. Understanding how these perturbations affect classifier utility is crucial for both designers and users. However, a general theoretical framework for quantifying this impact is lacking and also challenging, especially for complex or black-box classifiers.
  This paper presents a unified framework for theoretically quantifying classifier utility under LDP mechanisms. The key insight is that LDP perturbations are concentrated around the original data with a specific probability, allowing utility analysis to be reframed as robustness analysis within this concentrated region. Our framework thus connects the concentration properties of LDP mechanisms with the robustness of classifiers, treating LDP mechanisms as general distributional functions and classifiers as black boxes. This generality enables applicability to any LDP mechanism and classifier. A direct application of our utility quantification is guiding the selection of LDP mechanisms and privacy parameters for a given classifier. Notably, our analysis shows that piecewise-based mechanisms often yield better utility than alternatives in common scenarios.
  Beyond the core framework, we introduce two novel refinement techniques that further improve utility quantification. We then present case studies illustrating utility quantification for various combinations of LDP mechanisms and classifiers. Results demonstrate that our theoretical quantification closely matches empirical observations, particularly when classifiers operate in lower-dimensional input spaces.</description>

      <title>The Dark Side of LLMs: Agent-based Attacks for Complete Computer Takeover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of Large Language Model (LLM) agents and multi-agent systems enables remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. However, these systems introduce security vulnerabilities that extend beyond traditional content generation to system-level compromises. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs security used as reasoning engines within autonomous agents, highlighting how they can be exploited as attack vectors capable of achieving computer takeovers. We focus on how different attack surfaces and trust boundaries can be leveraged to orchestrate such takeovers. We demonstrate that adversaries can effectively coerce popular LLMs into autonomously installing and executing malware on victim machines. Our evaluation of 18 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals an alarming scenario: 94.4% of models succumb to Direct Prompt Injection, and 83.3% are vulnerable to the more stealthy and evasive RAG Backdoor Attack. Notably, we tested trust boundaries within multi-agent systems, where LLM agents interact and influence each other, and we revealed that LLMs which successfully resist direct injection or RAG backdoor attacks will execute identical payloads when requested by peer agents. We found that 100.0% of tested LLMs can be compromised through Inter-Agent Trust Exploitation attacks, and that every model exhibits context-dependent security behaviors that create exploitable blind spots.</description>

      <title>AndroByte: LLM-Driven Privacy Analysis through Bytecode Summarization and Dynamic Dataflow Call Graph Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the exponential growth in mobile applications, protecting user privacy has become even more crucial. Android applications are often known for collecting, storing, and sharing sensitive user information such as contacts, location, camera, and microphone data often without the user's clear consent or awareness raising significant privacy risks and exposure. In the context of privacy assessment, dataflow analysis is particularly valuable for identifying data usage and potential leaks. Traditionally, this type of analysis has relied on formal methods, heuristics, and rule-based matching. However, these techniques are often complex to implement and prone to errors, such as taint explosion for large programs. Moreover, most existing Android dataflow analysis methods depend heavily on predefined list of sinks, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address the limitations of these existing techniques, we propose AndroByte, an AI-driven privacy analysis tool that leverages LLM reasoning on bytecode summarization to dynamically generate accurate and explainable dataflow call graphs from static code analysis. AndroByte achieves a significant F\b{eta}-Score of 89% in generating dynamic dataflow call graphs on the fly, outperforming the effectiveness of traditional tools like FlowDroid and Amandroid in leak detection without relying on predefined propagation rules or sink lists. Moreover, AndroByte's iterative bytecode summarization provides comprehensive and explainable insights into dataflow and leak detection, achieving high, quantifiable scores based on the G-Eval metric.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Biosciences: Emerging Threats and Roadmap to Biosecurity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in the biosciences is transforming biotechnology, medicine, and synthetic biology. Yet this advancement is intrinsically linked to new vulnerabilities, as GenAI lowers the barrier to misuse and introduces novel biosecurity threats, such as generating synthetic viral proteins or toxins. These dual-use risks are often overlooked, as existing safety guardrails remain fragile and can be circumvented through deceptive prompts or jailbreak techniques. In this Perspective, we first outline the current state of GenAI in the biosciences and emerging threat vectors ranging from jailbreak attacks and privacy risks to the dual-use challenges posed by autonomous AI agents. We then examine urgent gaps in regulation and oversight, drawing on insights from 130 expert interviews across academia, government, industry, and policy. A large majority ($\approx 76$\%) expressed concern over AI misuse in biology, and 74\% called for the development of new governance frameworks. Finally, we explore technical pathways to mitigation, advocating a multi-layered approach to GenAI safety. These defenses include rigorous data filtering, alignment with ethical principles during development, and real-time monitoring to block harmful requests. Together, these strategies provide a blueprint for embedding security throughout the GenAI lifecycle. As GenAI becomes integrated into the biosciences, safeguarding this frontier requires an immediate commitment to both adaptive governance and secure-by-design technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance &amp; Trust Engine (AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates specialized security frameworks for each RMF function: the Agentic AI Threat Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection, and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Biorisk Evaluations on Open-Weight Bio-Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27629</link>

Abstract: Open-weight bio-foundation models present a dual-use dilemma. While holding great promise for accelerating scientific research and drug development, they could also enable bad actors to develop more deadly bioweapons. To mitigate the risk posed by these models, current approaches focus on filtering biohazardous data during pre-training. However, the effectiveness of such an approach remains unclear, particularly against determined actors who might fine-tune these models for malicious use. To address this gap, we propose BioRiskEval, a framework to evaluate the robustness of procedures that are intended to reduce the dual-use capabilities of bio-foundation models. BioRiskEval assesses models' virus understanding through three lenses, including sequence modeling, mutational effects prediction, and virulence prediction. Our results show that current filtering practices may not be particularly effective: Excluded knowledge can be rapidly recovered in some cases via fine-tuning, and exhibits broader generalizability in sequence modeling. Furthermore, dual-use signals may already reside in the pretrained representations, and can be elicited via simple linear probing. These findings highlight the challenges of data filtering as a standalone procedure, underscoring the need for further research into robust safety and security strategies for open-weight bio-foundation models.</description>

      <title>CryptoMoE: Privacy-Preserving and Scalable Mixture of Experts Inference via Balanced Expert Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private large language model (LLM) inference based on cryptographic primitives offers a promising path towards privacy-preserving deep learning. However, existing frameworks only support dense LLMs like LLaMA-1 and struggle to scale to mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures. The key challenge comes from securely evaluating the dynamic routing mechanism in MoE layers, which may reveal sensitive input information if not fully protected. In this paper, we propose CryptoMoE, the first framework that enables private, efficient, and accurate inference for MoE-based models. CryptoMoE balances expert loads to protect expert routing information and proposes novel protocols for secure expert dispatch and combine. CryptoMoE also develops a confidence-aware token selection strategy and a batch matrix multiplication protocol to improve accuracy and efficiency further. Extensive experiments on DeepSeekMoE-16.4B, OLMoE-6.9B, and QWenMoE-14.3B show that CryptoMoE achieves $2.8\sim3.5\times$ end-to-end latency reduction and $2.9\sim4.3\times$ communication reduction over a dense baseline with minimum accuracy loss. We also adapt CipherPrune (ICLR'25) for MoE inference and demonstrate CryptoMoE can reduce the communication by up to $4.3 \times$.

      <title>Feature compression is the root cause of adversarial fragility in neural network classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we uniquely study the adversarial robustness of deep neural networks (NN) for classification tasks against that of optimal classifiers. We look at the smallest magnitude of possible additive perturbations that can change a classifier's output. We provide a matrix-theoretic explanation of the adversarial fragility of deep neural networks for classification. In particular, our theoretical results show that a neural network's adversarial robustness can degrade as the input dimension $d$ increases. Analytically, we show that neural networks' adversarial robustness can be only $1/\sqrt{d}$ of the best possible adversarial robustness of optimal classifiers. Our theories match remarkably well with numerical experiments of practically trained NN, including NN for ImageNet images. The matrix-theoretic explanation is consistent with an earlier information-theoretic feature-compression-based explanation for the adversarial fragility of neural networks.</description>
