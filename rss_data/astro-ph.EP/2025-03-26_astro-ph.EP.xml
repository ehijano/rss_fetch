      <title>Spectral Effects of Shock Darkening on Ordinary Chondrite and Howardite, Eucrite, and Diogenite meteorites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impacts are the most ubiquitous processes on planetary bodies in our solar system. During these impact events, shock waves can deposit enough energy to produce shock-induced darkening in the target material, resulting in an alteration of its spectral properties. This spectral alteration can lead to an ambiguous taxonomic classification of asteroids and an incorrect identification of meteorite analogs. In this study, we investigated the effects of shock darkening on the visible and near-infrared spectra of ordinary chondrites and members of the howardites, eucrites, and diogenites clan. A decrease in albedo and suppression of the absorption bands with increasing shock darkening was observed for all the samples. We found that adding $\gtrsim$50\% of shock-darkened material to an unaltered sample was enough to change the taxonomic classification of an ordinary chondrite from S-complex to C- or X-complex. A similar amount was sufficient to change the taxonomic classification of a eucrite from V-type to O-type, whereas a eucrite composed of 100\% shock-darkened material was classified as a Q-type. We discuss the limitations of using just albedo for taxonomic classification of asteroids, which has implications for future space-based infrared surveys. We also investigated if shock darkening is responsible for a bias against the discovery of near-Earth objects (NEOs) with H and L chondrite-like compositions, which could explain the abundance of LL chondrites among NEOs.</description>

      <title>Leaky Dust Traps in Planet-Embedded Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the survival of dust disks for a few Myr to the establishment of chemical dichotomy, dust traps are expected to play a pivotal role in sculpting protoplanetary disks and the early planet formation process. These traps however may not be perfect as evidenced by the detection of gas and dust inside the gaps and cavities of structured disks. Using two-fluid hydrodynamic global simulations in both two-dimensions (2D) and three-dimensions (3D), we directly compute the dynamics of dust grains as they aerodynamically interact with the disk gas that is being perturbed by an embedded planet of varying mass. In both 2D and 3D, we find the dust trap to be more leaky for lower mass planet and for higher turbulent $\alpha$. More crucially, we find the fraction of the dust mass that remain trapped within the pressure bump can be up to an order of magnitude more reduced in 3D vs. 2D with all else equal. Our simulations show a complex behavior of dust radial motion that is both azimuthally and poloidally non-uniform, with the overall dynamics dominated by the dust coupling to the gas flow even for relatively high St = 0.1. The leaky traps we find suggest pebble isolation mass is likely not truly isolating and that gap-opening planets do not establish as an unconditional impermeable barrier. Our findings have implications for recent JWST MINDS results, which show that volatiles, including water, are present in the inner regions of disks hosting outer dust rings.</description>

      <title>An Upper Limit on the Interstellar Meteoroid Flux at Video Sizes from the Global Meteor Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material arriving at our solar system from the Galaxy may be detected at Earth in the form of meteors ablating in our atmosphere. Here we report on a search for interstellar meteors within the highest-quality events in the Global Meteor Network (GMN) database. No events were detected that were conclusively hyperbolic with respect to the Sun; however, our search was not exhaustive and examined only the top 57% of events, with a deeper examination planned for future work.
  This study's effective meteoroid mass limit is 6.6 +/- 0.8 x 10^{-5} kg (5 millimeter diameter at a density of 1000 kg m^{-3}). Theoretical rates of interstellar meteors at these sizes range from 3 to 200 events globally per year. The highest rates can already be largely excluded by this study, while at the lowest rates GMN would have to observe for 25 more years to be 50% confident of seeing at least one event. GMN is thus well positioned to provide substantial constraints on the interstellar population at these sizes over the coming years. This study's results are statistically compatible with a rate of interstellar meteors at the Earth at less than 1 per million meteoroid impacts at Earth at millimeter sizes, or a flux rate of less than 8 +/- 2 x 10^{-11} per sq. km per hour at the 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Understanding Compositional Evolution of Hollows at Dominici Crater, Mercury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollows on Mercury are small depressions formed by volatile loss, providing important clues about the volatile inventory of the planet's surface and shallow subsurface. We investigate the composition of hollows in various phases of devolatilization at Dominici crater. By applying a machine learning approach to MESSENGER Mercury Dual Imaging System data, we defined surface units within the study area and extracted their reflectance spectra. We applied linear (areal) spectral modeling using laboratory sulfides, chlorides, graphite, and silicate mineral spectra to estimate the composition of hollows and their surrounding terrains. At Dominici, the hollow on the crater rim/wall is interpreted to be active, while that in the center of the crater is interpreted as a waning hollow. We find that the active hollow predominantly comprises silicates (augite and albite), with a trace amount of graphite and CaS. In contrast, waning hollows contain marginally elevated sulfides (MgS and CaS) and graphite, but slightly lower silicates than the active hollow. The spectra of low reflectance terrain surrounding the hollows appear to be dominated by graphite and sulfides, which contribute to its darker appearance. We suggest that hollow at the crater forms due to thermal decomposition of sulfides, primarily MgS possibly mixed with CaS, as well as possible the depletion of graphite. As devolatilization wanes, a mixture of predominantly silicate minerals remains in the hollows - impeding further vertical growth.</description>

      <title>Impacts into Titan's methane-clathrate crust as a source of atmospheric methane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan is the only icy satellite in the solar system with a dense atmosphere. This atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen with a few percent methane, which supports an active, methane-based hydrological cycle on Titan. The presence of methane, however, is intriguing, as its lifetime is likely much shorter than the age of the solar system due to its irreversible destruction by UV photolysis. To explain Titan's current atmospheric methane abundance, it is hypothesised that a replenishment mechanism is needed. One such mechanism may be crater forming impacts; a methane-clathrate layer potentially covering the surface of Titan may act as a reservoir that releases methane when disrupted by impacts. Here, we perform impact simulations into methane-clathrate layers to investigate the amount of methane released via impacts. Our simulations show that the amount of methane released into the atmosphere depends on both the impactor size and the methane-clathrate layer thickness. A single 20-km-diameter impactor releases up to 1% of Titan's current atmospheric methane mass; the effect of impact obliquity and surface porosity may further increase the released mass by a factor of 2-3. The release rate from impacts is lower than the net loss rate by photolysis, but the released methane mass via impacts can enhance the lifetime of methane in Titan's atmosphere by up to 3%. Menrva-sized (&gt; 400 km diameter) crater-forming impacts directly liberate of $\sim$15% Titan's current atmospheric methane. The direct heating of the atmosphere by the impactor might contribute to additional crustal heating and methane release.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Variations of Temperature in Jupiter's Upper Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global temperatures in Jupiter's upper atmosphere are poorly constrained. Other than an in situ measurement by the Galileo Probe, all temperature data come from remote sensing methods which primarily rely on emissions from H$_3^+$, the dominant molecular ion in giant planet ionospheres. While H$_3^+$ temperature serves as a proxy for thermospheric temperature under specific conditions, the available H$_3^+$ observations at Jupiter have limited spatial coverage and a wide range of reported temperatures that complicate analysis of atmospheric temperatures. We present high resolution H$_3^+$ temperature maps near local solar noon collected over three half-nights in 2022 and 2023. Pole-to-pole temperature structure is consistent across time spans of one month to one year. Median equatorial ($\pm$ 25{\deg} latitude) temperature across all three nights is 762 $\pm$ 43 K, with night-to-night differences of $&lt;$75 K. Temperatures within the statistical locations of the northern and southern auroral ovals are 1200 $\pm$ 96 K and 1143 $\pm$ 120 K, respectively. A region $\sim$30 K cooler than its surroundings is found near 20{\deg} N, 90{\deg} W System III longitude, roughly coincident with a magnetic field anomaly, providing additional evidence for magnetic influence on Jupiter's upper atmosphere. Temperatures generally decrease smoothly from auroral to equatorial latitudes, consistent with the expected gradient if Jupiter's non-auroral latitudes are heated primarily by dynamical redistribution of auroral energy.</description>

      <title>The Trans-Neptunian Object (119951) 2002 KX14 as revealed by multiple stellar occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (119951) 2002 KX14 is a large classical TNO with limited previous observations and unresolved questions regarding its physical properties. Five stellar occultations by 2002 KX14 were observed from 2020 to 2023, involving multiple telescopes across different locations in Europe and the Americas. The five occultations resulted in 15 positive chords, accurately measuring the 2002 KX14's shape and size. The projected ellipse has semi-major and semi-minor axes of $241.0 \pm 7.2$ km and $157.1 \pm 5.2$ km, respectively, corresponding to an average area-equivalent diameter of $389.2 \pm 8.7$ km. The geometric albedo was estimated at $11.9 \pm 0.7\%$.</description>

      <title>Impact of MHD disk wind on early evolutionary stage of protoplanetary disk and dust growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution calculations to investigate the impact of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind on disk evolution and dust particle growth.To examine the effect of the MHD disk wind, we compare calculations with and without it. In disk evolution calculations, episodic accretion events (or outbursts) occur repeatedly, as reported in previous studies, regardless of the presence of the MHD disk wind. However, the time interval between outbursts is shorter in cases with the MHD disk wind than in those without it. For dust particle growth, during the infall phase, there is no significant difference between cases with and without the MHD disk wind, and dust particles grow to approximately 1-10\,cm. Inside the $\mathrm{H_{2}O}$ snowline, the maximum dust particle size is limited by the collisional fragmentation of dust particles. Outside the snowline, the maximum dust particle size is primarily determined by radial drift. After the infall phase, when the MHD disk wind is considered, the disk temperature decreases noticeably, and the snowline migrates inward. As a result, the dust particles can grow beyond 10\,cm. Therefore, we find that the MHD disk wind plays a crucial role in dust growth and planet formation after the infall phase.</description>

      <title>HST SHEL: Revealing Haze and Confirming Elevated Metallicity in the Warm Neptune HAT-P-26b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new and extended transmission spectrum of the warm Neptune HAT-P-26b spanning wavelengths between 0.29 - 5.0 microns. This spectrum is derived from new HST STIS G430L observations from the PanCET program, a reanalysis of the previously published HST STIS G750L data, along with the previously published HST WFC3 IR G102 and G141 data, and the two Spitzer IRAC photometric points at 3.6 and 4.5 microns. We present this analysis as part of the Sculpting Hubble's Exoplanet Legacy (SHEL) program, where the goals are to analyze all HST archival observations of transiting exoplanets using a uniform and homogeneous reduction technique. With the new wavelength coverage, we identify a scattering slope that is weaker than Rayleigh scattering and is best-matched by models incorporating a haze-only scenario. Our retrieval analysis reveals an atmospheric metallicity of 15(+22/-8) x solar which suggests that HAT-P-26b may have formed further out in the protoplanetary disk, in a region rich in hydrogen and helium but with fewer heavy elements, and later migrated inward. This super-solar metallicity places HAT-P-26b below the mass-metallicity trend of the solar system. Looking ahead, recent observations from JWST NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/G495H will provide critical, high-precision data that extend the spectral coverage into the infrared to further constrain the atmospheric composition and structure of HAT-P-26b. These observations have the potential to confirm or refine the metallicity and haze scenario presented here, offering unprecedented insights into the atmospheric properties of warm Neptunes and the processes governing their formation and migration histories.</description>

      <title>Irradiated Atmospheres II: Interplay Between Scattering and Vertical-Mixing induced Energy Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering is crucial for the atmospheric thermal profiles. The energy transport by the vertical mixing plays an essential role for the greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effect. This work explores the interaction between scattering and vertical mixing, specifically whether these processes enhance or mitigate each other's effects on atmospheric temperature. The interaction between mixing flux and scattering is nonlinear. Our calculations indicate that thermal scattering intensifies the greenhouse effects caused by vertical mixing in the middle atmosphere but reduces it in the lower layers. In the middle atmosphere, increased vertical mixing enhances the warming effect of the thermal scattering while diminishing the cooling effect of visible scattering. In the lower atmosphere, it enhances the anti-greenhouse effect linked to visible scattering and diminishes the greenhouse effect produced by thermal scattering. The combined influence of thermal scattering and vertical mixing on the lower atmosphere's greenhouse effect is weaker than their separate impacts, akin to $1+1&lt;2$. It is also interesting to note that the joint effect may also influence chemistry and cloud formation, altering the thermal structure.</description>

      <title>Systematic Reanalysis of KMTNet Microlensing Events, Paper II: Two New Planets in Giant-Source Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we continue to apply the updated KMTNet tender-love care (TLC) photometric pipeline to historical microlensing events. We apply the pipeline to a subsample of events from the KMTNet database, which we refer to as the giant source sample. Leveraging the improved photometric data, we conduct a systematic search for anomalies within this sample. The search successfully uncovers four new planet-like anomalies and recovers two previously known planetary signals. After detailed analysis, two of the newly discovered anomalies are confirmed as clear planets: KMT-2019-BLG-0578 and KMT-2021-BLG-0736. Their planet-to-host mass ratios are $q\sim4\times10^{-3}$ and $q\sim1\times10^{-4}$, respectively. Another event, OGLE-2018-BLG-0421 (KMT-2018-BLG-0831), remains ambiguous. Both a stellar companion and a giant planet in the lens system could potentially explain the observed anomaly. The anomaly signal of the last event, MOA-2022-BLG-038 (KMT-2022-BLG-2342), is attributed to an extra source star. Within this sample, our procedure doubles the number of confirmed planets, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the survey sensitivity.</description>

      <title>A high-resolution survey of protoplanetary disks in Lupus and the nature of compact disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the exoplanets discovered in our galaxy to date orbit low-mass stars, which tend to host small disks in their early stages. To better elucidate the link between planet formation and disk substructures, observational biases should be reduced through observations of these small, faint disks at the highest resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA). In this work, we present new high-resolution (0.03-0.04") ALMA observations at 1.3 mm of 33 disks located in the Lupus star-forming region. Combining archival data and previously published work, we provide a near-complete high resolution image library of 73 protoplanetary (Class II) disks in Lupus. This enable us to measure dust disk radii down to a limit of 0.6 au and analyze intensity profiles using visibility modeling. We show that 67% of Lupus protoplanetary disks have dust radii smaller than 30 au, with new substructures detected in 11, showing some of the shortest separation gaps. The size-luminosity relation in Lupus aligns well with a drift-dominated dust evolution scenario and, for the most compact disks (&lt; 30 au), we found dust masses ranging from 0.3 to 26.3 Earth masses. Assuming that the detected substructures were dynamical effects of planets, we estimated the planet masses to range from 20 to 2000 Earth masses with separations between 2 to 74 au. Our results indicate that two-thirds of the protoplanetary disks in Lupus are smooth, and compact, with substructures being more prominent in the few larger disks. These compact disks are consistent with drift-dominated evolution, with their masses and optical depths suggesting that they may have already experienced some planet formation, with most of the small solids converted into planetesimals and planets. This makes them prime candidates, for explaining the formation and origin of super-Earths. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Compositional Outcomes of Earth Formation from a Narrow Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address Earth formation from an elemental perspective, using a method similar to Rubie et al. (2015) but with updates from Dale et al. (2023) to simulate the chemical evolution of Earth's mantle during metal-silicate equilibration events from accretional collisions. Our model introduces two key differences: (1) Earth forms from a dense ring of planetesimals and planetary embryos near 1 AU, extending into the asteroid belt, and (2) we divide this population into four zones. The innermost zone contains planetesimals enriched in refractory elements relative to Si and depleted in volatiles. The remaining zones represent enstatite, ordinary, and CI chondrites. We fit the Earth's bulk silicate composition by adjusting the boundaries of these zones and the refractory enrichment in the inner zone, giving us four compositional free parameters. A fifth parameter relates to the depth of planetesimal equilibration after a giant impact. We examined twenty-two ring model simulations, expanded to forty-eight based on hot or cold targets during collisions. Seventeen simulations resulted in a mantle chemistry resembling the bulk silicate Earth (BSE), despite differences in growth sequences. These variations lead to different fitting parameter values, altering the proportions of different meteorite types required to match the BSE. However, findings show Earth must accrete 60-80% of material from the innermost refractory-enriched zone. This indicates that, with the right growth sequence, multiple ring model structures can yield an Earth-anaologue composition consistent with the BSE.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey II: The thermal emission of TOI-1468 b reveals a hot bare rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terrestrial exoplanets orbiting nearby small, cool stars known as M dwarfs are well suited for atmospheric characterisation. Given the strong XUV irradiation from M dwarf host stars, orbiting exoplanets are thought to be unable to retain primordial H/He-dominated atmospheres. However, the survivability of heavier secondary atmospheres is currently unknown. The aim of the Hot Rocks Survey programme is to determine if exoplanets can retain secondary atmospheres in the presence of M dwarf hosts. Among the sample of 9 exoplanets in the programme, here we aim to determine whether TOI-1468 b has a substantial atmosphere or is consistent with a low-albedo bare rock. The James Webb Space Telescope provides an opportunity to characterise the thermal emission with MIRI at 15 $\mu$m. TOI-1468 b's occultation was observed three times. We compare our observations to atmospheric models including varying amounts of CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O. The observed occultation depth for the individual visits are 239$\pm$52 ppm, 341$\pm$53 ppm and 357$\pm$52 ppm. A joint fit yields an occultation depth of 311$\pm$31 ppm. The thermal emission is mostly consistent with no atmosphere and zero Bond albedo at 1.65-$\sigma$ confidence level or a blackbody at a brightness temperature of 1024$\pm$78 K. A pure CO$_{2}$ or H$_{2}$O atmosphere with a surface pressure above 1 bar is ruled out over 3-$\sigma$. Surprisingly, TOI-1468 b presents a surface marginally hotter than expected, hinting at an additional source of energy on the planet. It could originate from a temperature inversion, induction heating or be an instrumental artifact. The results within the Hot Rocks Survey build on the legacy of studying the atmospheres of exoplanets around M dwarfs. The outcome of this survey will prove useful to the large-scale survey on M dwarfs recently approved by the STScI.</description>

      <title>Characterising M dwarf host stars of two candidate Hycean worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary systems orbiting M dwarf host stars are promising targets for atmospheric characterisation of low-mass exoplanets. Accurate characterisation of M dwarf hosts is important for detailed understanding of the planetary properties and physical processes, including potential habitability. Recent studies have identified several candidate Hycean planets orbiting nearby M dwarfs as promising targets in the search for habitability and life on exoplanets. In this study, we characterise two such M dwarf host stars, K2-18 and TOI-732. Using archival photometric and spectroscopic observations, we estimate their effective temperatures (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$) and metallicities through high-resolution spectral analyses and ages through gyrochronology. We assess the stellar activity of the targets by analysing activity-sensitive chromospheric lines and X-ray luminosities. Additionally, we predict activity cycles based on measured rotation periods and utilise photometric data to estimate the current stellar activity phase. We find K2-18 to be 2.9-3.1 Gyr old with T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ = 3645$\pm$52 K and metallicity of [Fe/H] = 0.10$\pm$0.12 dex, and TOI-732 to be older (6.7-8.6 Gyr), cooler (3213$\pm$92 K), and more metal-rich ([Fe/H] = 0.22$\pm$0.13 dex). Both stars exhibit relatively low activity making them favourable for atmospheric observations of their planets. The predicted activity cycle and analysis of available high-precision photometry for K2-18 suggest that it might have been near an activity minimum during recent JWST observations, though some residual activity may be expected at such minima. We predict potential activity levels for both targets to aid future observations, and highlight the importance of accurate characterisation of M dwarf host stars for exoplanet characterisation.</description>

      <title>Along-trajectory acoustic signal variations observed during the hypersonic reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule (SRC) on September 24, 2023, presented a rare opportunity to study atmospheric entry dynamics through a dense network of ground-based infrasound sensors. As the first interplanetary capsule to reenter over the United States since Stardust in 2006, this event allowed for unprecedented observations of infrasound signals generated during hypersonic descent. We deployed 39 single-sensor stations across Nevada and Utah, strategically distributed to capture signals from distinct trajectory points. Infrasound data were analyzed to examine how signal amplitude and period vary with altitude and propagation path for a non-ablating hypersonic object with well-defined physical and aerodynamic properties. Raytracing simulations incorporated atmospheric specifications from the Ground-2-Space model to estimate source altitudes for observed signals. Results confirmed ballistic arrivals at all stations, with source altitudes ranging from 44 km to 62 km along the trajectory. Signal period and amplitude exhibited strong dependence on source altitude, with higher altitudes corresponding to lower amplitudes, longer periods, and reduced high-frequency content. Regression analysis demonstrated strong correlations between signal characteristics and both altitude and propagation geometry. Our results suggest, when attenuation is considered, the amplitude is primarily determined by the source, with the propagation path playing a secondary role over the distances examined. These findings emphasize the utility of controlled SRC reentries for advancing our understanding of natural meteoroid dynamics, refining atmospheric entry models, and improving methodologies for planetary defense.</description>

      <title>A 1.48-2.48 $\mathrm{\mu}$m R=28000 spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the nearest pair of brown dwarfs: Luhman 16AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high signal-to-noise (SNR $\sim$ 450), high-dispersion ($R \equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 28\,000$) H- and K-band spectroscopic atlas of the L7.5 and T0.5 components of the Luhman 16AB binary (WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB): the closest pair of brown dwarfs, and one of the best substellar benchmarks. The spectra were combined from a 70-day spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the binary with IGRINS on Gemini South. We fit model photospheres to the combined high-quality spectra to estimate atmospheric parameters. The model is based on the Sonora model atmosphere further incorporating the effects of clouds and disequilibrium. We detect ammonia (NH3) lines in both binary components, making Luhman 16A the warmest object where individual NH3 lines were identified. We discover hydrogen (H2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and hydrogen fluoride (HF) lines in both components, following recent reports of these species in either cooler (H2, H2S in a T6 dwarf) or warmer (HF in young late-M or mid-L dwarfs) objects. Methane (CH4) shows a small contribution, with lines sensitive to the slight temperature difference spanning the L/T transition. Against model expectations, we do not detect FeH lines, implying more efficient iron rainout than incorporated in the models. We find various unidentified features in water-dominated regions, likely the result of residual inaccuracies in the water line lists. We searched for planetary-mass companions by periodogram analysis of radial velocities over 70 days but detected no significant signal. The upper limits of projected planetary mass are $M\sin{i}=$ 0.2 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.3 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 1 day, and 0.4 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ and 0.7 $M_{\mathrm{J}}$ at P $\sim$ 10 days for Luhman 16A and B, respectively.</description>

      <title>High angular resolution evidence of dust traps from deep ALMA Band 3 observations of LkCa15</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dust traps are the most promising mechanisms to explain the observed substructures in protoplanetary discs. In this work, we present high-angular resolution ($\sim$60 mas, 9.4 au) and high-sensitivity Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) observations at 3 mm of the transitional disc around LkCa15. The new data, combined with previous high-resolution observations at $\lambda=0.87,1.3$ mm, make LkCa15 an ideal laboratory for testing the dust trapping mechanism. We found that the width of the three rings decreases linearly with frequency, and the spectral indices show local minima at the locations of the rings, consistent with dust trap models. Multi-wavelength modelling confirms that the dust surface density and maximum grain size peak at 69 and 101 au, and suggestive peak at 42 au. The estimated total dust mass is between 13-250 M$_{\oplus}$, depending on the chosen opacity. The inner disc shows bright and unresolved emission at 3 mm, exhibiting a spectral index of $\alpha_{1.3-3 \rm mm} = 0.3 \pm 0.37$, and $\alpha_{\rm 3mm-3cm}$ ranging from $-0.1$ to $0.0$. These properties are consistent with free-free emission from an ionised jet or disc wind. Dust evolution models and radiative transfer calculations suggest that a viscosity coefficient of $\alpha = 10^{-3}$, a fragmentation velocity of 10 m s$^{-1}$, and DSHARP opacities provide the best match to the observed properties.</description>

      <title>Protoplanetary cores drove chondrule formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chondrules are small spherical objects that formed at high temperatures early in the history of the Solar System. The key compositional characteristics of chondrules may be well explained by high gas pressures in their formation environment (Galy et al. 2000; Alexander et al. 2008). However, such high gas pressures are widely considered astrophysically unreasonable (Ebel et al. 2023). Here, we propose that chondrules were formed via the processing of dust grains in the dust-rich envelopes of planetary embryos, before getting ejected via convective diffusion. We show that this scenario can explain many salient constraints on chondrule formation, including formation locations; mass and timescale of chondrule production; repeat chondrule heating events; heating timescales; and, most crucially, high prevailing gas pressures. Our work suggests that high gas pressures may indeed have prevailed during the formation of chondrules, reconciling previous analytical observations, experimental evidence, and theory. We suggest that chondrules are mostly the products rather than the precursors of planetary embryo formation - a result which would have important implications for our understanding of the early history of the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The results indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 15 degrees can experience average residuals of 12.4 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 155 degrees at distances below 1500 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 10 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than two degrees beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium, we find that dark matter energy input raises planetary temperature and accelerates rotation. The energy distribution depends on planetary properties and external input, suggesting that previous studies have overestimated its heating effect. When dark matter density is high, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and is primarily governed by dark matter. For Earth, our model predicts a 0.015 K temperature increase and a $10^{-8}$ rad/s angular velocity increase over 100 years.</description>
