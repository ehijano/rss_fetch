      <title>H, He-like recombination spectra VI: Quadrupole $l$-changing collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a simple analytic formula that well describes quadrupole $l$-changing collisions of the form $nl \rightarrow nl'$, as confirmed by comparison with numerical quantal Born calculations obtained with the program autostructure (Badnell 2011). Such formulae could easily be included in models of astrophysical plasma emission, such as the hydrogen and helium-like recombination spectra. When compared with the results of previous quantal calculations based upon an analytic solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation by Vrinceanu &amp; Flannery (2001), we find relatively good agreement, with the exception of large $l &gt; n/2$ transitions. We provide a tentative explanation for such discrepancies. However, we also show that the rates for quadrupole $l$-changing collisions are typically two orders of magnitude lower than the dipolar ones. Inclusion of the quadrupolar rates in a hydrogenic collisional-radiative model of nebular plasma shows minimal changes to the level populations, typically within 1% in nebular conditions. Simple and complete theories are now available for $l$-changing collisions suitable for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Charge Exchange Emission in Supernova Remnant N132D from XRISM/Resolve Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: XRISM has delivered one of its first light observations on N132D, the X-ray brightest supernova remnant in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Utilizing 193 ks of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy data, we conduct a comprehensive search for charge exchange emission. By incorporating a charge exchange model into our spectral analysis, we observe an improvement in the fits of two weak features at 2.41 keV and 2.63 keV. These features, with a combined significance of 99.6%, are consistent with transitions from highly ionized silicon ions in high Rydberg states, which are unique indicators of charge exchange. Our analysis constrains the charge exchange flux to no more than 4% of the total source flux within the 1.7-3.0 keV band, and places an upper limit on the charge exchange interaction velocity at 450 km/s. This result supports ongoing shock-cloud interactions within N132D and highlights the unique capabilities of XRISM to probe the complex physical processes at play.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dynamics of charmonia in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of charmonium systems in strong external magnetic fields using a relativistic light-front Hamiltonian approach within the Basis Light-Front Quantization (BLFQ) framework. By solving the eigenvalue problem for the invariant mass squared operator with confinement potentials and one-gluon-exchange interactions, we obtain the mass spectrum and wave functions under varying magnetic fields. Our results reveal significant spectral modifications via the Zeeman effect, including $\eta_c$-$J/\psi$ mixing and magnetic sublevel splitting. Momentum density analysis demonstrates wave function deformation, with transverse momentum broadening and longitudinal narrowing under strong fields, alongside structural shifts in parton distributions such as double-hump profiles in excited states. Relativistic corrections and center-of-mass coupling critically drive these dynamics, highlighting the necessity of a relativistic framework for QCD bound states in extreme magnetic environments.</description>

      <title>Competition of light- and phonon-dressing in microwave-dressed Bose polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the stationary properties of a spin-1/2 impurity immersed in a one-dimensional confined Bose gas. In particular, we consider coherently coupled spin states with an external field, where only one spin component interacts with the bath, enabling light dressing of the impurity and spin-dependent bath-impurity interactions. Through detailed comparisons with ab-initio many-body simulations, we demonstrate that the composite system is accurately described by a simplified effective Hamiltonian. The latter builds upon previously developed effective potential approaches in the absence of light dressing. It can be used to extract the impurity energy, residue, effective mass, and anharmonicity induced by the phononic dressing. Light-dressing is shown to increase the polaron residue, undressing the impurity from phononic excitations because of strong spin coupling. For strong repulsions-previously shown to trigger dynamical Bose polaron decay (a phenomenon called temporal orthogonality catastrophe), it is explained that strong light-dressing stabilizes a repulsive polaron-dressed state. Our results establish the effective Hamiltonian framework as a powerful tool for exploring strongly interacting polaronic systems and corroborating forthcoming experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Squeezing light with optomechanical and spin-light quantum interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate squeezing of light through quantum-noise-limited interactions with two different material systems: an ultracold atomic spin ensemble and a micromechanical membrane. Both systems feature a light-matter quantum interface that we exploit, respectively, to generate polarization squeezing of light through Faraday interaction with the collective atomic spin precession, and ponderomotive quadrature squeezing of light through radiation pressure interaction with the membrane vibrations in an optical cavity. Both experiments are described in a common theoretical framework, highlighting the conceptual similarities between them. The observation of squeezing certifies light-matter coupling with large quantum cooperativity, a prerequisite for applications in quantum science and technology. In our experiments, we obtain a maximal cooperativity of $C_\mathrm{qu} =10$ for the spin and $C_\mathrm{qu} = 9$ for the membrane. In particular, our results pave the way for hybrid quantum systems where spin and mechanical degrees of freedom are coherently coupled via light, enabling new protocols for quantum state transfer and entanglement generation over macroscopic distances.</description>

      <title>Miniaturized optical system for a chip based cold atom inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We miniaturized the complex optical system responsible for the cooling, pumping and imaging of an on-chip based cold atom inertial sensor. This optical bench uses bonded miniature optics and includes all the necessary optical functions. The bench has a volume of 35x25x5~cm$^3$. We developed a laser frequency lock adapted to the optical bench using saturated absorption in a rubidium cell. The entire laser source based on frequency doubling of 1.56~$\mu$m fiber lasers, including the control system and the saturated absorption module, fits in a $5U$-rack. Using the miniaturized bench, we realized two and three dimensional magneto optical traps for Rubidium 87 atoms.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Trilepton and tetralepton bound and resonant states: the QED counterpart of multiquark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first prediction of tetralepton resonant states containing muons, extending beyond the simplest tetralepton system, dipositronium ($\mathrm{Ps}_2$). With the rapid advancements in experimental facilities, the production and study of these intriguing states may be within reach. We perform a comprehensive analysis of S-wave trilepton and tetralepton systems within the framework of a QED Coulomb potential. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the three- or four-body Schr\"odinger equation and utilize the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. We uncover a series of bound and resonant states in the trilepton systems $e^+e^+e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-$, $e^+e^+\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-$, as well as the tetralepton systems $e^+e^+e^-e^-$, $\mu^+\mu^+\mu^-\mu^-$, and $\mu^+\mu^+e^-e^-$. The energies of these states range from $-30$ eV to $-1$ eV below the total mass of three or four leptons, with their widths varying from less than $0.01$ eV to approximately $0.07$ eV. Additionally, we calculate the spin configurations and root mean square radii of these states, providing insight into their spatial structures. No bound or resonant states are found in the trilepton $e^+\mu^+e^-$, $\mu^+e^+\mu^-$ systems, nor in the tetralepton $\mu^+e^+\mu^-e^-$ system. A comparison with fully heavy tetraquark systems reveals that the additional color degree of freedom in QCD results in the absence of low-energy bound and resonant states. However, this extra degree of freedom allows for a broader range of $J^{PC}$ quantum numbers to produce resonant states, highlighting the rich complexity of QCD systems.</description>
