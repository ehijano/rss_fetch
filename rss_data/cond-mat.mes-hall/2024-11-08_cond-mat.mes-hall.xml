      <title>This took us a Weyl: synthesis of a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet with point Fermi surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials governed by emergent topological fermions have become a cornerstone of physics. Dirac fermions in graphene form the basis for moir\'e quantum matter, and Dirac fermions in magnetic topological insulators enabled the discovery of the quantum anomalous Hall effect. In contrast, there are few materials whose electromagnetic response is dominated by emergent Weyl fermions. Nearly all known Weyl materials are overwhelmingly metallic, and are largely governed by irrelevant, conventional electrons. Here we theoretically predict and experimentally observe a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet in van der Waals (Cr,Bi)$_2$Te$_3$. In transport, we find a record bulk anomalous Hall angle $&gt; 0.5$ along with non-metallic conductivity, a regime sharply distinct from conventional ferromagnets. Together with symmetry analysis, our data suggest a semimetallic Fermi surface composed of two Weyl points, with a giant separation $&gt; 75\%$ of the linear dimension of the bulk Brillouin zone, and no other electronic states. Using state-of-the-art crystal synthesis techniques, we widely tune the electronic structure, allowing us to annihilate the Weyl state and visualize a unique topological phase diagram exhibiting broad Chern insulating, Weyl semimetallic and magnetic semiconducting regions. Our observation of a semimetallic Weyl ferromagnet offers an avenue toward novel correlated states and non-linear phenomena, as well as zero-magnetic-field Weyl spintronic and optical devices.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Emergence via Domain Wall Anchoring through Vertical Bloch Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions, topologically stable magnetic solitons characterized by whirling magnetization in nanoscale magnetic elements, show promise information carriers in spintronics and spin-based quantum computing due to their unique properties: small size, stability, and controllability. In this study, we introduce a novel method of skyrmion generation through domain wall deformation dynamics. Our analytical and micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that domain wall motion exceeding the Walker threshold induces topological deformation of magnetic domain walls exhibiting Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This deformation process catalyzes the emergence of skyrmions from magnetic domain wall structure distortion, specifically through the Anchoring of domain walls due to the vertical Bloch line. We elucidate the underlying mechanism of skyrmion generation, correlating it with topological transitions accompanied by burst energy dissipation through spin-wave radiation. Notably, we present robust skyrmion generation conditions through a comprehensive classification of domain wall distortion, including vertical Bloch line generation and annihilation in magnetic domain wall dynamics within a DMI system. These findings provide noble insights into topological behaviors of spin structures and offer a potential pathway for efficient, controlled skyrmion creation in the next-generation spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Frictional Dissipation and Scaling Laws at van der Waals Interface: The Key Role of Elastic Pinning of Moir\'e at Edges and Corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterogeneous interfaces are promising candidates for the scaling up of structural superlubricity to meet practical applications. Several factors, however, have been identified that may eliminate superlubricity. Elasticity is one such intrinsic factor, where shear induced lattice reconstruction leads to local interfacial pinning, even at clean pristine contacts. Here, through detailed atomistic simulations, we reveal that incomplete moir\'e tile pinning at the corners and edges of finite sliders dominates friction from the nano- to the microscales. We further demonstrate that slider shape tailoring and twisting allow to control energy dissipation and its scaling with contact size, thus opening the way to achieve large-scale superlubricity.</description>

      <title>Keldysh field theory approach to electric and thermoelectric transport in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the current and the noise power matrix in a quantum dot connected to two metallic reservoirs by using the Keldysh field theory approach, a non-equilibrium quantum field theory language in the functional integral formalism. We first show how this technique allows us to recover rapidly and straightforwardly well-known results in literature, such as the Meir-Wingreen formula for the average current, resulting extremely effective in dealing with quantum transport problem. We then discuss in detail the electric and thermoelectric properties due to transport of electrons in the case of a single-level and two-level non-interacting quantum dot. In particular, we derive the optimal conditions for maximizing the thermoelectric current, finding an upper limit for the thermoelectric coefficient. Moreover, in the two-level system we show that the zero-temperature linear conductance drops rapidly to zero by a symmetrical removal of the degeneracy at the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Fractionally Quantized Electric Polarization and Discrete Shift of Crystalline Fractional Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional Chern insulators (FCI) with crystalline symmetry possess topological invariants that fundamentally have no analog in continuum fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. Here we demonstrate through numerical calculations on model wave functions that FCIs possess a fractionally quantized electric polarization, $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, where $\text{o}$ is a high symmetry point. $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$ takes fractional values as compared to the allowed values for integer Chern insulators because of the possibility that anyons carry fractional quantum numbers under lattice translation symmetries. $\vec{\mathscr{P}}_{\text{o}}$, together with the discrete shift $\mathscr{S}_{\text{o}}$, determine fractionally quantized universal contributions to electric charge in regions containing lattice disclinations, dislocations, boundaries, and/or corners, and which are fractions of the minimal anyon charge. We demonstrate how these invariants can be extracted using Monte Carlo computations on model wave functions with lattice defects for 1/2-Laughlin and 1/3-Laughlin FCIs on the square and honeycomb lattice, respectively, obtained using the parton construction. These results comprise a class of fractionally quantized response properties of topologically ordered states that go beyond the known ones discovered over thirty years ago.</description>

      <title>New classes of quantum anomalous Hall crystals in multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent experimental observation of quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effects in the rhombohedrally stacked pentalayer graphene has motivated theoretical discussions on the possibility of quantum anomalous Hall crystal (QAHC), a topological version of Wigner crystal. Conventionally Wigner crystal was assumed to have a period $a_{\text{crystal}}=1/\sqrt{n}$ locked to the density $n$. In this work we propose new types of topological Wigner crystals labeled as QAHC-$z$ with period $a_{\text{crystal}}=\sqrt{z/n}$. In rhombohedrally stacked graphene aligned with hexagon boron nitride~(hBN), we find parameter regimes where QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 have lower energy than the conventional QAHC-1 at total filling $\nu=1$ per moir\'e unit cell. These states all have total Chern number $C_\mathrm{tot}=1$ and are consistent with the QAH effect observed in the experiments. The larger period QAHC states have better kinetic energy due to the unique Mexican-hat dispersion of the pentalayer graphene, which can compensate for the loss in the interaction energy. Unlike QAHC-1, QAHC-2 and QAHC-3 also break the moir\'e translation symmetry and are sharply distinct from a moir\'e band insulator. We also briefly discuss the competition between integer QAHC and fractional QAHC states at filling $\nu=2/3$. Besides, we notice the importance of the moir\'e potential. A larger moir\'e potential can greatly change the phase diagram and even favors a QAHC-1 ansatz with $C=2$ Chern band.</description>

      <title>Split Cherenkov radiation in isotropic chiral matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral matter exhibits unique electromagnetic responses due to the macroscopic manifestation of the chiral anomaly as anomalous transport currents. Here, we study the modification of electromagnetic radiation in isotropic chiral matter characterized by an axion coupling that varies linearly over time $\theta(t) = b_0 t$. Using Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics, we derive the causal Green's function to investigate the stability and radiation properties of the system. Even though the plane-wave modes of isotropic chiral matter exhibit imaginary frequencies for long wavelengths, which might suggest instability in the system, we show that their contribution is confined to the near-field region. Also we find no exponentially growing fields at arbitrarily large times, so that stability is preserved. Under these conditions the radiation yields a positive energy flux, although this is not an inherent property of the general definition. In the case of a fast-moving charge, we confirm the existence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation and show that, for refractive indices $n &gt; 1$, the Cherenkov cone can split into two concentric cones with opposite circular polarizations. This split, governed by the speed of the particle $v$, $n$ and $b_0$, resembles the optical spin-Hall effect and offers potential applications for creating circularly polarized terahertz (THz) light sources. Our Green's function approach provides a general method for analyzing radiation in chiral matter, from Weyl semimetals to quark-gluon plasmas, and can be extended to systems such as oscillating dipoles and accelerated charges.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spintronic THz Emitters Without External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of state-of-the-art spintronic THz emitters (W or Ta)/CoFeB/Pt with non-magnetic underlayer deposited using oblique angle deposition. The THz emission amplitude in the presence or absence of an external magnetic field remains the same and remarkably stable over time. This stability is attributed to the enhanced uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic layer, achieved by oblique angle deposition of the underlying non-magnetic layer. Our findings could be used for the development of practical field-free emitters of linearly polarized THz radiation, potentially enabling novel applications in future THz technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum limited imaging of a nanomechanical resonator with a spatial mode sorter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of a spatial mode sorter to image a nanomechanical resonator, with the goal of studying the quantum limits of active imaging and extending the toolbox for optomechanical force sensing. In our experiment, we reflect a Gaussian laser beam from a vibrating nanoribbon and pass the reflected beam through a commercial spatial mode demultiplexer (Cailabs Proteus). The intensity in each demultiplexed channel depends on the mechanical mode shapes and encodes information about their displacement amplitudes. As a concrete demonstration, we monitor the angular displacement of the ribbon's fundamental torsion mode by illuminating in the fundamental Hermite-Gauss mode (HG$_{00}$) and reading out in the HG$_{01}$ mode. We show that this technique permits readout of the ribbon's torsional vibration with a precision near the quantum limit. Our results highlight new opportunities at the interface of quantum imaging and quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Fermionic transport through a driven quantum point contact: breakdown of Floquet thermalization beyond a critical driving frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantum system that consists of two fermionic chains coupled by a driven quantum point contact (QPC). The QPC contains a bond with a periodically varying tunneling amplitude. Initially the left chain is packed with fermions while the right one is empty. We numerically track the evolution of the system and demonstrate that, at frequencies above a critical one, the current through the QPC halts, and the particle imbalance between the chains remains forever. This implies a spectacular breakdown of the Floquet version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis which predicts a homogeneous particle density profile at large times. We confirm the effect for various driving protocols and interparticle interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of adiabatic orbital pumping, highlighting qualitative differences from spin pumping. An oscillating magnetic field pumps not only orbital angular momentum current but also orbital angular position current. The latter, which has no spin counterpart, underscores the incompleteness of existing orbital torque theories. Importantly, both types of orbital currents can be detected as transverse electric voltages, which contain considerable second harmonic components unlike in spin pumping. Moreover, orbital currents can be pumped by lattice dynamics that carry phonon angular momentum, implying that orbital currents can, in turn, induce phonon angular momentum. Our work open up new possibilities for generating orbital currents and provides a broader understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital, and phonon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a close theoretical connection between topological Floquet physics and cavity QED, yet this connection has not been realized experimentally due to complicated cavity QED models that often arise. We propose a simple, experimentally viable protocol to realize non-adiabatic topological photon pumping mediated by a single qubit, which we dub the anomalous Floquet photon pump. For both quantized photons and external drive, the system exhibits a non-trivial topological phase across a broad range of parameter space. Transitions out of the topological phase result from frequency-space delocalization. Finally, we argue that the protocol can be implemented in existing experiments via driven qubit non-linearities, with topological pumping witnessed in measurements of the cavity Wigner distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Floquet Phases. A resonance phenomena</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Floquet topological phases emerge when systems are periodically driven out-of-equilibrium. They gained attention due to their external control, which allows to simulate a wide variety of static systems by just tuning the external field in the high frequency regime. However, it was soon clear that their relevance goes beyond that, as for lower frequencies, anomalous phases without a static counterpart are present and the bulk-to-boundary correspondence can fail. In this work we discuss the important role of resonances in Floquet phases. For that, we present a method to find analytical solutions when the frequency of the drive matches the band gap, extending the well-known high frequency analysis of Floquet systems. With this formalism, we show that the topology of Floquet phases with resonances can be accurately captured in analytical terms. We also find a bulk-to-boundary correspondence between the number of edge states in finite systems and a set of topological invariants in different frames of reference, which crucially do not explicitly involve the micromotion. To illustrate our results, we periodically drive a SSH chain and a $\pi$-flux lattice, showing that our findings remain valid in various two-band systems and in different dimensions. In addition, we notice that the competition between rotating and counter-rotating terms must be carefully treated when the undriven system is a semi-metal. To conclude, we discuss the implications to experimental setups, including the direct detection of anomalous topological phases and the measurement of their invariants.</description>

      <title>The Floquet Fluxonium Molecule: Driving Down Dephasing in Coupled Superconducting Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-coherence qubits, which can store and manipulate quantum states for long times with low error rates, are necessary building blocks for quantum computers. Here we propose a driven superconducting erasure qubit, the Floquet fluxonium molecule, which minimizes bit-flip rates through disjoint support of its qubit states and suppresses phase flips by a novel second-order insensitivity to flux-noise dephasing. We estimate the bit-flip, phase-flip, and erasure rates through numerical simulations, with predicted coherence times of approximately 50 ms in the computational subspace and erasure lifetimes of about 500 $\mu$s. We also present a protocol for performing high-fidelity single-qubit rotation gates via additional flux modulation, on timescales of roughly 500 ns, and propose a scheme for erasure detection and logical readout. Our results demonstrate the utility of drives for building new qubits that can outperform their static counterparts.</description>

      <title>On Nanowire Morphological Instability and Pinch-Off by Surface Electromigration</title>

Abstract: Surface diffusion and surface electromigration may lead to a morphological instability of thin solid films and nanowires. In this paper two nonlinear analyses of a morphological instability are developed for a single-crystal cylindrical nanowire that is subjected to an axial current. These treatments extend the conventional linear stability analyses without surface electromigration, that manifest a Rayleigh-Plateau instability. A weakly nonlinear analysis is done slightly above the Rayleigh-Plateau (longwave) instability threshold. It results in a one-dimensional Sivashinsky amplitude equation that describes a blow-up of a surface perturbation amplitude in a finite time. This is a signature of a pinching singularity of a cylinder radius, which leads to a wire separation into a disjoint segments. The time- and electric field-dependent dimensions of the focusing self-similar amplitude profile approaching a blow-up are characterized via the scaling analysis. Also, a weakly nonlinear multi-scale analysis is done at the arbitrary distance above a longwave or a shortwave instability threshold. The time- and electric field-dependent Fourier amplitudes of the major instability modes are derived and characterized.</description>

      <title>Surface Conduction and Reduced Electrical Resistivity in Ultrathin Non-Crystalline NbP Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thinner films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we uncover a reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in NbP semimetal, deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 \deg C. In sub-5 nm thin films, we find a significantly lower room temperature resistivity (~34 microOhm*cm for 1.5 nm thin NbP) than in the bulk form, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness. Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower resistivity is due to conduction via surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <title>Engineering Fault-tolerant Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bosonic codes offer a hardware-efficient approach to encoding and protecting quantum information with a single continuous-variable bosonic system. In this paper, we introduce a new universal quantum gate set composed of only one type of gate element, which we call the quantum lattice gate, to engineer bosonic code states for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We develop a systematic framework for code state engineering based on the Floquet Hamiltonian engineering, where the target Hamiltonian is constructed directly from the given target state(s). We apply our method to three basic code state engineering processes, including single code state preparation, code space embedding and code space transformation. Furthermore, we explore the application of our method to automatic quantum error correction against single-photon loss with four-legged cat codes. Our proposal is particularly well-suited for superconducting circuit architectures with Josephson junctions, where the full nonlinearity of Josephson junction potential is harnessed as a quantum resource and the quantum lattice gate can be implemented on a sub-nanosecond timescale.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Son's model for graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>
