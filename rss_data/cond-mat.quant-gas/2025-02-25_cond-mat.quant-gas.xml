      <title>Hartree-Fock approximation for bosons with symmetry-adapted variational wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hartree-Fock approximation for bosons employs variational wave functions that are a combination of permanents. These are bosonic counterpart of the fermionic Slater determinants, but with the significant distinction that the single-particle orbitals used to construct a permanent can be arbitrary and do not need to be orthogonal to each other. Typically, the variational wave function may break the symmetry of the Hamiltonian, resulting in qualitative and quantitative errors in physical observables. A straightforward method to restore symmetry is projection after variation, where we project the variational wave function onto the desired symmetry sector. However, a more effective strategy is variation after projection, which involves first creating a symmetry-adapted variational wave function and then optimizing its parameters. We have devised a scheme to realize this strategy and have tested it on various models with symmetry groups ranging from $\mathbb{Z}_2$, $\text{C}_L$, to $\text{D}_L$. In all the models and symmetry sectors studied, the variational wave function accurately estimates not only the energy of the lowest eigenstate but also the single-particle correlation function, as it approximate the target eigenstate very well on the wave function level. We have applied this method to study few-body bound states, superfluid fraction, and Yrast lines of some Bose-Hubbard models. This approach should be valuable for studying few-body or mesoscopic bosonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in understating the limitations imposed by quantum noise in precision measurements and devising techniques to reduce it. The attention is currently turning to the simultaneously estimation of several parameters of interest, driven by its promising potential across a wide range of sensing applications as well as fueled by experimental progress in various optical and atomic platforms. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of key research directions in multiparameter quantum sensing and metrology, highlighting both opportunities and challenges. We introduce the basic framework, discuss ultimate sensitivity bounds, optimal measurement strategies, and the role of quantum incompatibility, showing important differences with respect to single-parameter estimation. Additionally, we discuss emerging experimental implementations in distributed quantum sensing, including cutting-edge optimization techniques. This review aims to bridge the gap between theory and experiments, paving the way for the next-generation of quantum sensors and their integration with other quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the relaxation dynamics in an open system, composed by a quantum gas of bosons in a lattice interacting via both contact and global interactions. We report the onset of periodic oscillations of the atomic coherences exhibiting hallmarks of synchronization after a quantum quench. The dynamical behavior exhibits the many-body collapse and revival of atomic coherences and emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system. We further show that the approximate symmetry can dynamically self-organize. We argue that the approximate symmetry can be tailored to obtain long-lived coherences. These insights provide a general recipe to engineer the dynamics of globally-interacting systems.</description>

Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of isolated three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large scattering length.

      <title>Measurement of total phase fluctuation in cold-atomic quantum simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studying the dynamics of quantum many-body systems is often constrained by the limitations in probing relevant observables, especially in continuous systems. A powerful method to gain information about such systems is the reconstruction of local currents from the continuity equation. We show that this approach can be used to extract the total phase fluctuation of adjacent Bose gases. We validate our technique numerically and demonstrate its effectiveness by analyzing data from selected experiments simulating 1D quantum field theories through the phase difference of two parallel 1D Bose gases. This analysis reveals the previously hidden sector of the sum mode of the phase, which is important for studying long-time thermalization and out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the system. Our method is general and can be applied to other cold atom systems with spatial phase gradients, thereby expanding the scope and capabilities of cold-atomic quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general kinetic approach to studying high-frequency collective excitations in arbitrary-spin quantum gases. To this end, we formulate a many-body Hamiltonian that includes the multipolar exchange interaction as well as the coupling of a multipolar moment with an external field. By linearizing the respective collisionless kinetic equation, we find a general dispersion equation that allows us to examine the high-frequency collective modes for arbitrary-spin atoms obeying one or another quantum statistics. We analyze some of its particular solutions describing spin waves and zero sound for Bose and Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and (Non)-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the quench spectroscopy method to dissipative and isolated non-Hermitian quantum lattice models via the case study of the open Bose-Hubbard chain and the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain respectively. We first investigate theoretically the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase induced by a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions using the equation-of-motion approach. Using the same analytical approach, we then discuss the applicability of the quench spectroscopy to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the sudden global quench dynamics of the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain confined in the paramagnetic phase. We finally generalize this spectroscopy method to isolated Hermitian quantum lattice models characterized by a quadratic fermionic or bosonic Hamiltonian. For this purpose, we consider the case study of the Hermitian version of the latter one-dimensional lattice model. The investigation is performed analytically for the bosonic and fermionic reformulations while considering for each case the equation-of-motion and quasiparticle theoretical approaches.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: We use the finite-temperature extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation (TeGPE) to study a condensate of dipolar NaCs molecules under the conditions of the very recent, breakthrough experiment [Bigagli et.al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. We report the condensate fraction of the system, and its density profile after a time-of flight expansion for the coldest experimental case, finding excellent agreement with the experimental measurements. We also report the peak density of the ground state and establish a comparison with the experimental estimates. Our results, derived from the TeGPE formalism, successfully describe the Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules at finite temperature.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in Heavy Fermion Systems: Mean-Field study on Kondo Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a novel collinear magnet, i.e. the altermagnet (AM), with spin-splitting energy band and zero net magnetization have attracted great interest due to its potential spintronic applications. Here, we demonstrate AM-like phases in a microscopic Kondo lattice (KL) model with an alternating next-nearest-neighbor-hopping (NNNH). Such alternating NNNH take nonmagnetic atoms, neglected in usual antiferromagnetism study, into account when encountering real-life candidate AM materials. With the framework of fermionic parton mean-field theory, we find three different ground-states for the half-filling KL: 1) a $d$-wave AM state; 2) a coexistent phase with both $d$-wave AM and intrinsic Kondo screening effect; 3) a Kondo insulator. The AM-like states are characterized by their spin-splitting quasiparticle bands, Fermi surface, spin-resolved distribution function and conductivity. It is suggested that the magnetic quantum oscillation, scanning tunneling microscopy and charge transport measurement can detect those AM-like phases. We hope the present work may be useful for exploring AM-like phases in $f$-electron compounds such as CeNiAsO and Ce$_{4}$X$_{3}$(X=As,Sb,Bi).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for a class of quantum models of interacting bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum models of interacting bosons have a wide range of applications, including the propagation of optical modes in nonlinear media, such as the $k$-photon down-conversion. Many of these models are related to nonlinear deformations of finite group algebras and, in this sense, are exactly solvable. While advanced group-theoretic methods were developed to study the eigenvalue spectrum, in quantum optics, the primary focus is not on the spectrum of the Hamiltonian but rather on the evolution of an initial state -- such as the generation of optical signal modes by a strong pump mode propagating through a nonlinear medium. I propose a simple and general method to solve the state evolution problem, applicable to a broad class of quantum models of interacting bosons. For the k-photon down-conversion model and its generalizations, the solution to the state evolution problem is expressed as an infinite series expansion in powers of the propagation time, with coefficients determined by a recursion relation involving only a single polynomial function. This polynomial function is unique to each nonlinear model. As an application, I compare the exact solution of the parametric down-conversion process with the semiclassical parametric approximation.</description>

Abstract: We develop an excited-state real-space renormalization group (RSRG-X) formalism to describe the dynamics of conserved densities in randomly interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems. Our formalism is suitable for systems with $\textrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, and we apply it to chains of randomly positioned spins with dipolar $XX+YY$ interactions, as arise in Rydberg quantum simulators and other platforms. The formalism generates a sequence of effective Hamiltonians which provide approximate descriptions for dynamics on successively smaller energy scales. These effective Hamiltonians involve ``superspins'': two-level collective degrees of freedom constructed from (anti)aligned microscopic spins. Conserved densities can then be understood as relaxing via coherent collective spin flips. For the well-studied simpler case of randomly interacting nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ chains, the superspins reduce to single spins. Our formalism also leads to a numerical method capable of simulating the dynamics up to an otherwise inaccessible combination of large system size and late time. Focusing on disorder-averaged infinite-temperature autocorrelation functions, in particular the local spin survival probability $\overline{S_p}(t)$, we demonstrate quantitative agreement in results between our algorithm and exact diagonalization (ED) at low but nonzero frequencies. Such agreement holds for chains with nearest-neighbor, next-nearest-neighbor, and long-range dipolar interactions. Our results indicate decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$ slower than any power law and feature no significant deviation from the $\sim 1/ \log^2(t)$ asymptote expected from the infinite-randomness fixed-point of the nearest-neighbor model. We also apply the RSRG-X formalism to two-dimensional long-range systems of moderate size and find slow late-time decay of $\overline{S_p}(t)$.</description>
