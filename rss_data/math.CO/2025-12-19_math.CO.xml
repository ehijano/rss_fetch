      <title>A note on the rainbow Tur\'an number of brooms with length 2 handles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $F$, the rainbow Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,F)$ is the largest number of edges possible in an $n$-vertex graph which admits a rainbow-$F$-free proper edge-coloring. We focus on the rainbow Tur\'an numbers of trees obtained by appending some number of pendant edges to one end of a length 2 path; we call such a tree with $k$ total edges a $k$-edge broom with length $2$ handle, denoted by $B_{k,2}$. Study of $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,B_{k,2})$ was initiated by Johnston and Rombach, who claimed a proof asymptotically establishing the value of $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,B_{k,2})$ for all $k$. We correct an error in this original argument, identifying two small cases in which the value claimed in the literature is incorrect; in all other cases, we recover the originally claimed value. Our argument also characterizes the extremal constructions for $\mathrm{ex^*}(n,B_{k,2})$ for certain congruence classes of $n$ modulo $k$.</description>

      <title>Basis inversion in lambda-recursive families: triangular kernels and polynomial basis changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polynomial families {f_n(x)}_{n&gt;=0} over a commutative ring R encoded by triangular arrays of order m, via expansions of the form f_n(x)=sum_{b=0}^{floor(n/m)} lambda_1(n,b) x^{n-mb}, where lambda_1 is the direct kernel supported on 0&lt;=b&lt;=floor(n/m). Under a simple discrete orthogonality condition, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an inverse kernel lambda_3 (triangular of the same order) giving the inversion formula x^n = sum_{b=0}^{floor(n/m)} lambda_3(n,b) f_{n-mb}(x). This reindexing principle yields explicit change-of-basis relations between two families, including the case of distinct step sizes m_1 and m_2, with connection coefficients obtained from a universal triangular sum once lambda_3 is known. On the algebraic side, lambda_1 defines a lower Hessenberg matrix M_(n,k) (the algebraic expansion matrix) whose determinant governs inversion, providing closed determinantal expressions for lambda_3(n,k). We introduce a class of lambda-recursive sequences of order m, specified by a principal factor (p_n) and auxiliary factors (h_(n,k)), for which det(M_(n,k)) satisfies a recurrence enabling direct computation of inverse-kernel and basis-change coefficients. Classical families (e.g., Chebyshev, Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre, Fibonacci, Lucas) fit naturally into this framework, unifying their connection coefficients via the same triangular-array computations and supporting structured Clenshaw-type schemes and related applications.</description>

      <title>On the maximum ratio between chromatic number and clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(n)$ be the maximum, over all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, of the ratio $\frac{\chi(G)}{\omega(G)}$, where $\chi(G)$ denotes the chromatic number of $G$ and $\omega(G)$ the clique number of $G$. In 1967, Erd\H{o}s showed that \[ \Big( \frac{1}{4} +o(1) \Big) \frac{n}{(\log_2 n)^2} \le f(n) \le \big( 4+o(1) \big) \frac{n}{(\log_2 n)^2} .\] We show that \[ f(n) \le \big(c+o(1)\big) \frac{n}{(\log_2 n)^2}\] for some $c&lt;3.72$. This follows from recent improvements in the asymptotics of Ramsey numbers and is the first improvement in the asymptotics of $f(n)$ established by Erd\H{o}s.</description>

      <title>Increasing Trees and the Degree-Chromatic Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of binary increasing trees is the number of alternating permutations. Riordan found the formulas for the number of ternary and quaternary increasing trees. We obtain an explicit formula for the number of $\text{$m$-ary}$ increasing trees for any $m$, which can be expressed in terms of the degree-chromatic polynomial of the complete graph.</description>

      <title>Multiple polylogarithms at non-positive indices and combinatorics of Magnus polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate multiple polylogarithms with non-positive multi-indices (nonpositive MPLs) from a combinatorial and algebraic viewpoint. By introducing a correspondence between non-positive multiple polylogarithms and Magnus polynomials in a free associative algebra, we obtain an explicit Magnus-type representation of products of mono-indexed non-positive MPLs. The main identity (Theorem A) expresses such a product as a single non-positive MPL indexed by a Magnus polynomial, which may be regarded as a M\"obius inversion of the expansion formula due to Duchamp-Hoang Ngoc Minh-Ngo. Moreover, we study the effects of permuted indices and show that certain differences of Magnus polynomials belong to the kernel of the linear map ${\rm Li}^-_{\bullet}$ , leading to new functional equations among non-positive MPLs of the same weight and depth. These results clarify the combinatorial structure underlying non-positive MPLs and reveal a close connection with the Magnus expansion in non-commutative algebra.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds on the independence number of a graph in terms of degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an integer $\Delta \ge 3$, let ${\cal G}_{\Delta }$ be the set of connected graphs $G\neq K_{\Delta +1}$ with maximum degree $\Delta $ and, for $i=1,\cdots, \Delta $, let $V_i(G)$ be the set of vertices of $G$ of degree $i$. Using a result of T. Kelly and L. Postle, we prove that $\sum\limits_{i=1}^\Delta c_i|V_i(G)|$ is a lower bound on the independence number $\alpha(G)$ of $G\in {\cal G}_\Delta$, where $c_\Delta=\frac{1}{\Delta}$ and $ic_{i}=1-c_{i+1}$ for $i=1,\cdots,\Delta-1$. Moreover, if $\varepsilon &gt;0$ and $j\in \{1,\cdots, \Delta\}$, then the inequality $\alpha(G)\ge \varepsilon|V_j(G)|+\sum\limits_{i=1}^\Delta c_i|V_i(G)|$ does not hold for infinitely many graphs $G\in {\cal G}_\Delta$. Finally, further lower bounds on $\alpha(G)$ in terms of degrees of $G$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hamming weights of additive codes and geometric counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the geometric problem of determining the maximum number $n_q(r,h,f;s)$ of $(h-1)$-spaces in the projective space $\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)$ such that each subspace of codimension $f$ does contain at most $s$ elements. In coding theory terms we are dealing with additive codes that have a large $f$th generalized Hamming weight. We also consider the dual problem of the minimum number $b_q(r,h,f;s)$ of $(h-1)$-spaces in $\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)$ such that each subspace of codimension $f$ contains at least $s$ elements. We fully determine $b_2(5,2,2;s)$ as a function of $s$. We additionally give bounds and constructions for other parameters.</description>

      <title>Inducibility in $H$-free graphs and inducibility of Tur\'an graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For graphs $F$ and $H$, let $i(F)$ denote the inducibility of $F$ and let $i_H(F)$ denote the inducibility of $F$ over $H$-free graphs. We prove that for almost all graphs $F$ on a given number of vertices, $i_{K_k}(F)$ attains infinitely many values as $k$ varies. For complete partite graphs $F$ (and, more generally, for symmetrizable families of graphs $F$), we prove that $i_H(F)=i_{K_k}(F)$ where $k=\chi(H)$, and is attained by a complete $\ell$-partite graphon $W_{F,k}$, where $\ell &lt; k$.
  We determine the part sizes of $W_{F,k}$ for all $k$, whence determine $i(F)$, whenever $F$ is the Tur\'an graph on $s$ vertices and $r$ parts, for all $s \le 3r+1$, which was recently proved by Liu, Mubayi, and Reiher for $s=r+1$. As a corollary, this determines the inducibility of all Tur\'an graphs on at most $14$ vertices. Furthermore, since inducibility is invariant under complement, this determines the inducibility of all matchings and, more generally, all graphs with maximum degree $1$, of any size. Similarly, this determines the inducibility of all triangle factors, of any size.
  For complete partite graphs $F$ with at most one singleton part, we prove that $i_{K_k}(F)$ only attains finitely many values as $k$ varies; in particular, there exists $t=t(F)$ such that $i(F)$ is attained by some complete $t$-partite graphon. This is best possible as it was shown by Liu, Pikhurko, Sharifzadeh, and Staden that this is not necessarily true if there are two singleton parts.
  Finally, for every $r$, we give a nontrivial sufficient condition for a complete $r$-partite graph $F$ to have the property that $i(F)$ is attained by a complete partite graphon all whose part sizes are distinct.</description>

      <title>Some results on Hamming graphs and an extended Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we first obtain the spectrum of the folded hypercube in a new approach. Then we introduce a new family of graphs called the extended Hamming graph, denoted by $EH(n,2^n)$, which is constructed from the well-known Hamming graph $H(n,2^n)$. The graph $EH(n,2^n)$ shares the same vertex set as $H(n,2^n)$ but includes additional edges, called complementary edges, connecting each $n$-tuple vertex $u$ to its complement $u^c$, where $u^c$ is defined such that the sum of each two corresponding coordinates of $u$ and $u^c$ equals $2^n-1$. We investigate several algebraic and structural properties of this new family of graphs. Specifically, we show that the diameter of $EH(n,2^n)$ is $n$. We prove that $EH(n,2^n)$ is a Cayley graph, but we demonstrate that it is not a distance regular graph. Finally, we determine the spectrum of $EH(n,2^n)$, showing that its eigenvalues are $\lambda_i\pm 1$, where $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of the underlying Hamming graph $H(n,2^n)$. The multiplicity of each eigenvalue is explicitly calculated.</description>

      <title>On the Codebook Design for NOMA Schemes from Bent Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uplink grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for massive connectivity with low latency and high energy efficiency. In code-domain NOMA schemes, the requirements boil down to the design of codebooks that contain a large number of spreading sequences with low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) while maintaining low coherence. When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence. In this work, we propose a theoretical construction of NOMA codebooks by applying a recursive approach to those particular quadratic bent functions in smaller dimensions. The proposed construction yields desired NOMA codebooks that contain $6\cdot N$ Golay sequences of length $N=2^{4m}$ for any positive integer $m$ and have the lowest possible coherence $1/\sqrt{N}$.</description>

      <title>The number of edges of a symmetric edge polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric edge polytope of a simple graph is a lattice polytope defined as the convex hull of a subset of the type A roots corresponding to the edges of the graph. In this article we prove a sharp lower bound for the number of edges of the symmetric edge polytope of a graph as a function of elementary graph invariants. Moreover, we characterize graphs attaining this bound. We highlight a connection with the h*-polynomial of such polytopes and, motivated by a conjecture of Ohsugi and Tsuchiya, we investigate the behaviour of such polynomial under edge-deletion in the graph.</description>

      <title>Finite-state transducers for substitution tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of algorithmic techniques for handling substitution tilings by treating a tile's hierarchy of supertiles in a purely combinatorial fashion using finite state automata. The resulting techniques are very convenient for practical generation of patches of tilings such as hats, Spectres and Penrose tiles, both random and deliberately selected. They also permit some analyses of the represented tiling. A particular product of this process is two substitution systems for the hat tiling which are "unambiguous" in that a single tile address uniquely determines the rest of the plane.</description>

      <title>The $d$-chromatic Ramsey number for stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1978, Chung and Liu generalized the definition of the Ramsey number. They introduced the $d$-chromatic Ramsey number as follows. Let $1\leq d&lt; c$ be integers and let $A_{1}, \dots, A_{t}$ be subsets with size $d$ of $[c]$, where $t= {c\choose d}$. For given graphs $G_{1}, \dots, G_{t}$, {\it the $d$-chromatic Ramsey number}, $r^{d, c}(G_{1}, \dots, G_{t})$, is the minimum positive integer $N$ such that every $c$-coloring of $E(K_{N})$ yields a copy of $G_{i}$ whose edges are colored by colors in the color set $A_{i}$ for some $i\in [t]$. The {\it star-critical $d$-chromatic Ramsey number}, $r_{*}^{d, c}(G_{1}, \dots, G_{t})$, is the minimum positive integer $k$ such that every $c$-coloring of $E(K_{N}- K_{1, N- 1- k})$ yields a copy of $G_{i}$ whose edges are colored by colors in the color set $A_{i}$ for some $i\in [t]$, where $N= r^{d, c}(G_{1}, \dots, G_{t})$. If $G_{1}, \dots, G_{t}= G$, then we simplify them as $r^{d, c}(G)$ (it also call {\it the weakened Ramsey number}) and $r^{d, c}_{*}(G)$, respectively. In this paper, we determine all the value of $r^{d, c}(K_{1, n})$, $r_{*}^{d, c}(K_{1, n})$ and part of the value of $r^{d, c}(K_{1, n_{1}}, \dots, K_{1, n_{t}})$.</description>

Furthermore, we make a connection between certain subfriezes of a Heronian frieze and Pl\"ucker friezes $P(3,n)$, and then show that some determinants of the matrices whose elements lie in those subfriezes are vanishing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we illustrate important aspects of the interplay between weighing matrices, $(v,k,\lambda)$-graphs with fixed-point free involutions, and signed graphs with an orthogonal adjacency matrix, which arises from thin divisible design graphs. In particular, we present two new recursive constructions of regular symmetric Hadamard matrices with constant diagonal (equivalently, two new recursive constructions of strongly regular graphs) and we find a fixed-point free involution in the symplectic graph $Sp(4,q)$, where $q$ is odd, which leads to orthogonal signings for an infinite family of antipodal distance-regular graphs of diameter 3.</description>

      <title>Drawing strategies in Strong Ramsey games for 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Strong Ramsey game $\mathcal{R}(B,G)$ is a two player game with players $P_1$ and $P_2$, where $B$ and $G$ are $k$-uniform hypergraphs for some $k \geq 2$. $G$ is always finite, while $B$ may be infinite. $P_1$ and $P_2$ alternately color uncolored edges $e \in B$ in their respective color and $P_1$ begins. Whoever completes a monochromatic copy of $G$ in their own color first, wins the game. If no one claims a monochromatic copy of $G$ in a finite number of moves, the game is declared a draw. In this paper, we give an infinite set of 3-uniform hypergraphs $\{G_t\}_{t \geq 3}$, such that $P_2$ has a drawing strategy in the Strong Ramsey game $\mathcal{R}(K_{\aleph_0}^{(3)}, G_t)$. This improves a result by David, Hartarsky and Tiba.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial description of when a self-associated set of points fails to be arithmetically Gorenstein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the set of points associated to a self-dual code with no proportional columns is arithmetically Gorenstein if and only if the code is indecomposable. This answers a question asked by Toh{\u{a}}neanu. We do so by providing a combinatorial way to compute the dimension of the Schur square of a self-dual code through a zero-one symmetrization of its generator matrix. Our approach also allows us to compute the Gorenstein defect. As a consequence, we obtain a combinatorial characterization of arithmetically Gorenstein self-associated sets of points over an algebraically closed field.</description>

      <title>Embedding trees using minimum and maximum degree conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A variant of the Erd\H{o}s-S\'os conjecture, posed by Havet, Reed, Stein and Wood, states that every graph with minimum degree at least $\lfloor 2k/3 \rfloor$ and maximum degree at least $k$ contains a copy of every tree with $k$ edges. Both degree bounds are best possible. We confirm this conjecture for large trees with bounded maximum degree, by proving that for all $\Delta\in \mathbb{N}$ and sufficiently large $k\in \mathbb{N}$, every graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq \lfloor 2k/3 \rfloor$ and $\Delta(G)\geq k$ contains a copy of every tree $T$ with $k$ edges and $\Delta(T)\leq \Delta$. We also prove similar results where alternative degree conditions are considered. For the same class of trees, this verifies exactly a related conjecture of Besomi, Pavez-Sign\'e and Stein, and provides asymptotic confirmations of two others.</description>

      <title>Staircase Minimality and a Proof of Saxl's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $\rho_k = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally.
  Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $\rho_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{\mu\mu} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof.
  We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.</description>

      <title>Linear dimension of group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two fundamental ways to represent a group are as permutations and as matrices. In this paper, we study linear representations of groups that intertwine with a permutation representation. Recently, D'Alconzo and Di Scala investigated how small the matrices in such a linear representation can be. The minimal dimension of such a representation is the \emph{linear dimension of the group action} and this has applications in cryptography and cryptosystems.
  We develop the idea of linear dimension from an algebraic point of view by using the theory of permutation modules. We give structural results about representations of minimal dimension and investigate the implications of faithfulness, transitivity and primitivity on the linear dimension. Furthermore, we compute the linear dimension of several classes of finite primitive permutation groups. We also study wreath products, allowing us to determine the linear dimension of imprimitive group actions. Finally, we give the linear dimension of almost simple finite $2$-transitive groups, some of which may be used for further applications in cryptography. Our results also open up many new questions about linear representations of group actions.</description>

      <title>Block-transitive designs with a poset of imprimitive partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study block designs which admit an automorphism group that is transitive on blocks and points, and leaves invariant every partition in a given finite poset of partitions of the point set. The full stabiliser $G$ of all the partitions in the poset is a generalised wreath product. We use the theory of generalised wreath products to give necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the `array' of a point-subset $B$, for the set of $G$-images of $B$ to form the block-set of a $G$-block-transitive $2$-design. This generalises previous results for the special cases where the poset is a chain or an anti-chain. We also give explicit infinite families of examples of $2$-designs for each poset involving three proper partitions, and for the famous $N$-poset with four partitions. (Posets with two proper partitions have been treated previously.) This suggests the problem of finding explicit examples for other posets.</description>

      <title>Counting appearances of integers in sets of arithmetic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sequence $A067549$ of The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences is defined as $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ with $a_k$ being the determinant of the $k \times k$ matrix whose diagonal contains the first $k$ prime numbers and all other elements are ones. We relate this sequence to a concrete counting problem. Choose an arbitrary residue class $r_i$ for each prime $p_i$ with $1 \leq i \leq k$ and set $P_k = \prod_{i=1}^k p_i$. We show that $a_k$ is the number of integers in $[1, P_k]$ that are contained in \emph{at most} one of the $k$ chosen residue classes. Interestingly, we show that this sequence is closely related to the better known sequence $A005867$ for which we derive a novel characterisation in terms of determinants and which gives the number of integers in $[1, P_k]$ that are not contained in any of the $k$ residue classes.
  Our proof is purely structural and, therefore, it can be generalised to counting appearances of integers in residue classes of arbitrary arithmetic progressions generated by $k$ different primes using the determinant of a matrix of ones having those $k$ primes on its diagonal. The revealed structure also offers a fast way of calculating such determinants.</description>

      <title>Skew hook Schur functions and the cyclic sieving phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix an integer $t \geq 2$ and a primitive $t^{\text{th}}$ root of unity $\omega$. We consider the specialized skew hook Schur polynomial $\text{hs}_{\lambda/\mu}(X,\omega X,\dots,\omega^{t-1}X/Y,\omega Y,\dots,\omega^{t-1}Y)$, where $\omega^k X=(\omega^k x_1, \dots, \omega^k x_n)$, $\omega^k Y=(\omega^k y_1, \dots, \omega^k y_m)$ for $0 \leq k \leq t-1$. We characterize the skew shapes $\lambda/\mu$ for which the polynomial vanishes and prove that the nonzero polynomial factorizes into smaller skew hook Schur polynomials. Then we give a combinatorial interpretation of $\text{hs}_{\lambda/\mu}(1,\omega^d,\dots,\omega^{d(tn-1)}/1,\omega^d,\dots,\omega^{d(tm-1)})$, for all divisors $d$ of $t$, in terms of ribbon supertableaux. Lastly, we use the combinatorial interpretation to prove the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of semistandard supertableaux of shape $\lambda/\mu$ for odd $t$. Using a similar proof strategy, we give a complete generalization of a result of Lee--Oh (arXiv: 2112.12394, 2021) for the cyclic sieving phenomenon on the set of skew SSYT conjectured by Alexandersson--Pfannerer--Rubey--Uhlin (Forum Math. Sigma, 2021).</description>

      <title>Complete non-ambiguous trees and associated permutations: new enumerative results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15756v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a link between complete non-ambiguous trees (CNATs) and permutations exhibited by Daniel Chen and Sebastian Ohlig in recent work. In this, they associate a certain permutation to the leaves of a CNAT, and show that the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly one CNAT is $2^{n-2}$. We connect this to work by the first author and co-authors linking complete non-ambiguous trees and the acyclic orientation number of the associated permutation graph. This allows us to prove a number of conjectures by Chen and Ohlig on the number of $n$-permutations that are associated with exactly $k$ CNATs for various $k &gt; 1$, via various bijective correspondences between such permutations. We also exhibit a new bijection between $(n-1)$-permutations and CNATs whose permutation is the decreasing permutation $n(n-1)\cdots1$. This bijection maps the left-to-right minima of the permutation to dots on the top row of the corresponding CNAT, and descents of the permutation to empty rows of the CNAT.</description>

      <title>Bounded degree graphs and hypergraphs with no full rainbow matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a multi-hypergraph $G$ that is edge-colored into color classes $E_1, \ldots, E_n$, a full rainbow matching is a matching of $G$ that contains exactly one edge from each color class $E_i$. One way to guarantee the existence of a full rainbow matching is to have the size of each color class $E_i$ be sufficiently large compared to the maximum degree of $G$. In this paper, we apply a simple iterative method to construct edge-colored multi-hypergraphs with a given maximum degree, large color classes, and no full rainbow matchings. First, for every $r \ge 1$ and $\Delta \ge 2$, we construct edge-colored $r$-uniform multi-hypergraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ such that each color class has size $|E_i| \ge r\Delta - 1$ and there is no full rainbow matching, which demonstrates that a theorem of Aharoni, Berger, and Meshulam (2005) is best possible. Second, we construct properly edge-colored multigraphs with no full rainbow matchings which disprove conjectures of Delcourt and Postle (2022). Finally, we apply results on full rainbow matchings to list edge-colorings and prove that a color degree generalization of Galvin's theorem (1995) does not hold.</description>

      <title>Permutations with a Given X-Descent Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on the work of Grinberg and Stanley, we begin a systematic study of permutations with a prescribed $X$-descent set. In particular, for a set $X \subseteq \mathbb{N}^2$, and $I \subseteq [n-1]$, we study the permutations $\pi \in \mathfrak{S}_n$ whose $X$-descent set is precisely $I$, meaning $(\pi_i,\pi_{i+1}) \in X$ precisely when $i \in I$. The central focus is enumerating these permutations for a fixed $X,I$ and $n$: this count is denoted by $d_X(I;n)$. We derive a recursion which under expected conditions simplifies to a binomial-type recurrence determined entirely by the values $d_X(\emptyset;n)$. This extends the work of D\'iaz-Lopez et al.\ on descent polynomials. The resulting reduction shows that the general statistic $d_X(I;n)$ is typically governed by the ``descent-free'' quantities $d_X(\emptyset;n)$, motivating a closer analysis of these numbers. We observe that $d_X(\emptyset;n)$ enumerates Hamiltonian paths in a directed graph canonically associated to $X$. We then record several families of sets $X$ for which $d_X(\emptyset;n)$ is explicit or effectively computable. This includes families with periodicity for which transfer matrix methods apply, and families with succession-type relations where inclusion-exclusion applies. We then investigate the typical behavior of $d_X(\emptyset;n)$ from a probabilistic perspective.</description>

Abstract: Defant and Kravitz considered the following problem: Suppose that, to the right of a foot, there is a line of colored socks that needs to be sorted. However, at any point in time, one can only either place the leftmost sock to the right of the foot onto the foot (stack) or remove the outermost sock on the foot and make it the rightmost sock to the left of the foot (unstack). In this paper, we explicitly describe all minimal initial sock orderings that are unsortable.</description>

      <title>Grounded partitions of type $A_1^{(1)}$ at levels 1 and 2: bijections, affine crystal graphs, and partition identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grounded partitions, introduced by Dousse and Konan, are coloured partitions satisfying difference conditions given by a matrix with nonnegative integer entries. For the matrices studied in this paper, the generating functions are known to be infinite products, corresponding to the principal specialisation of characters of highest weight modules of type $A_1^{(1)}$. We give the first bijective proof that the generating functions of grounded partitions at level $2$ are infinite products. We then give a new combinatorial model for affine crystal graphs of type $A_1^{(1)}$ at level $2$, where the vertices are grounded partitions and the arrows are given by explicit bracketing rules. The grounded partition model for affine crystal graphs of highest weights $\Lambda_0$, $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_0 + \Lambda_1$ gives rise to new $q$-series identities obtained by decomposing the affine crystal graphs into the crystal graphs of finite type $A_1$ via the restricted representation.</description>

      <title>Tropical fans supporting a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An affine tropical fan is called regular if it supports a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection. For some cases the classification of regular fans is already complete. It was proved by Fink that tropical varieties of degree 1 are exactly Bergman fans, and later Esterov and Gusev classified all lattice polytopes whose mixed volume equals 1. We introduce the notion of a gallery for tropical fans and use it to classify all one-dimensional regular fans, thereby obtaining a minimal model programme for such fans. In dimension 2 we prove a finiteness theorem: every regular fan that satisfies the given upper bound condition is precisely the support of a finite covering by two-dimensional galleries, and only finitely many such fans exist.</description>

      <title>Characteristic quasi-polynomials of deletions of Shi arrangements of type C and type D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characteristic quasi-polynomials enumerate the number of points in the complement of hyperplane arrangements modulo positive integers. In this paper, we compute the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the restrictions of the Shi arrangements of type C and type D by one given hyperplane, respectively. The case of type C is established by extending the method developed in our previous work on type B (\cite{HN2024}), while the case of type D is deduced through a direct connection with the results on type B. As a corollary, we determine whether period collapse occurs in the characteristic quasi-polynomials of the deletions of the Shi arrangements of type C and type D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zamolodchikov periodicity is a property of certain discrete dynamical systems and was one of the primary motivations for the creation of cluster algebras. It was first observed by Zamolodchikov in his study of thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, initially for simply-laced Dynkin diagrams. It was proved by Keller to hold for tensor products of two Dynkin diagrams, and further shown by Galashin and Pylyavskyy to hold for pairs of commuting simply-laced Cartan matrices of finite type, which Stembridge classified in his study of admissible $W$-cells. We prove that the Zamolodchikov periodic cluster algebras are in bijection with pairs of commuting (not necessarily reduced or simply-laced) Cartan matrices of finite type. We fully classify all such pairs into 29 infinite families and 14 exceptional types in addition to the 6 infinite families and 11 exceptional types in Stembridge's classification, and show that all of these families can be derived from simply-laced types through two operations preserving Zamolodchikov periodicity, folding and taking transpose. Our work holds connections to Kazhdan--Lusztig theory, and our main theorem helps classify all nonnegative $W$-cells for products of two dihedral groups, $W = I_2(p)\times I_2(q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dimension of a partially ordered set $P$ (poset for short) is the least positive integer $d$ such that $P$ is isomorphic to a subposet of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with the natural product order. Dimension is arguably the most widely studied measure of complexity for posets, and standard examples in posets are the canonical structure forcing dimension to be large. In many ways, dimension for posets is analogous to chromatic number for graphs with standard examples in posets playing the role of cliques in graphs. However, planar graphs have chromatic number at most four, while posets with planar diagrams may have arbitrarily large dimension. The key feature of all known constructions of such posets is that large dimension is forced by a large standard example. The question of whether every poset of large dimension and with a planar cover graph contains a large standard example has been a critical challenge in posets theory since the early 1980s, with very little progress over the years. We answer the question in the affirmative. Namely, we show that every poset $P$ with a planar cover graph has dimension $\mathcal{O}(s^8)$, where $s$ is the maximum order of a standard example in $P$.</description>

      <title>Parametrizing the Grassmannian using pipe dreams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Postnikov gave a parametrization for the totally non-negative Grassmannian using the matroid decomposition and associating a network with \reflectbox{L}-diagrams. Talaska and Williams extend this result to the entire Grassmannian by using the Deodhar decomposition instead of the matroid decomposition, and the networks this time are associated with the generalized versions of \reflectbox{L}-diagrams, which are called Go-diagrams. We provide an alternative parametrization for the Deodhar components, this time constructing a network based on the pipe dreams associated with the Go-diagrams.
  This parametrization has several nice properties; for one, it allows us to easily calculate the image of a point under the isomorphism $Gr_{k,n}\simeq Gr_{n-k,n}$. The second feature of this parametrization is that if we write the Pl\"ucker coordinates using the Lindst\"orm-Gessel-Viennot (LGV) lemma in our parametrization, we can associate a pipe dream to each summand, which allows us to reveal additional structure on the summands. Finally, as an application of our parametrization, we describe a case where we can conclude whether one Deodhar component lies inside the closure of another.</description>

      <title>Colouring ($P_2\cup P_4$, diamond)-free graphs with $\omega$ colours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an optimal $\chi$-binding function for $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs. We prove that for any graph $G$ in this class, $\chi(G)\le 4$ when $\omega(G)=2$, $\chi(G)\le 6$ when $\omega(G)=3$, and $\chi(G)=\omega(G)$ when $\omega(G)\ge 4$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. This result extends the known chromatic bounds for $(P_2\cup P_3,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs by showing that $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs admit the same $\chi$-binding function. It also refines the chromatic bound obtained by Angeliya, Karthick and Huang [arXiv:2501.02543v3 [math.CO], 2025] for $(P_2\cup P_4,\text{ diamond})$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Ramsey problems for graphs in Euclidean spaces and Cartesian powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, let $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be the smallest positive integer $r$ such that there exists an $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with no monochromatic unit-copy of $H$, that is a set of $|V(H)|$ vertices of the same color such that any two vertices corresponding to an edge of $H$ are at distance one.
  This Ramsey-type function extends the famous Hadwiger--Nelson problem on the chromatic number $\chi(\mathbb{R}^n)=\chi_{K_2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of the space from a complete graph $K_2$ on two vertices to an arbitrary graph $H$. It also extends the classical Euclidean Ramsey problem for congruent monochromatic subsets to the family of those defined by a specific subset of unit distances.
  Among others, we show that $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)=\chi(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for any even cycle $H$ of length $8$ or at least $12$ as well as for any forest and that $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)=\lceil\chi(\mathbb{R}^n)/2\rceil$ for any sufficiently long odd cycle. Our main tools and results, which are of independent interest, establish that Cartesian powers enjoy Ramsey-type properties for graphs with favorable Tur\'an-type characteristics, such as zero hypercube Tur\'an density.
  In addition, we prove induced variants of these results, find bounds on $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for growing dimensions $n$, and prove a canonical-type result. We conclude with many open problems. One of these is to determine $\chi_{C_4}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, for a cycle $C_4$ on four vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inducibility of a graph represents its maximum density as an induced subgraph over all possible sequences of graphs of size growing to infinity. This invariant of graphs has been extensively studied since its introduction in $1975$ by Pippenger and Golumbic. In $2017$, Czabarka, Sz\'ekely and Wagner extended this notion to leaf-labeled rooted binary trees, which are objects widely studied in the field of phylogenetics. They obtain the first results and bounds for the densities and inducibilities of such trees. Following up on their work, we apply Razborov's flag algebra theory to this setting, introducing the flag algebra of rooted leaf-labeled binary trees. This framework allows us to use polynomial optimization methods, based on semidefinite programming, to efficiently obtain new upper bounds for the inducibility of trees and to improve existing ones. Additionally, we obtain the first outer approximations of profiles of trees, which represent all possible simultaneous densities of a pair of trees in a sequence of trees of growing sizes. Finally, we are able to prove the non-convexity of some of these profiles.</description>

      <title>Paired Disjunctive Domination Number of Middle Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of domination in graphs plays a central role in understanding structural properties and applications in network theory. In this study, we focus on the paired disjunctive domination number in the context of middle graphs, a transformation that captures both adjacency and incidence relations of the original graph. We begin by investigating this parameter for middle graphs of several special graph classes, including path graphs, cycle graphs, wheel graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, star graphs, friendship graphs, and double star graphs. We then present general results by establishing lower and upper bounds for the paired disjunctive domination number in middle graphs of arbitrary graphs, with particular emphasis on trees. Additionally, we determine the exact value of the parameter for middle graphs obtained through the join operation. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of domination-type parameters in transformed graph structures and offer new insights into their combinatorial behavior.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem: $\mathsf{Grundy~Total~Domination}$, $\mathsf{L\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$, and $\mathsf{Z\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-complete when parameterized by the solution size.
  On the other hand, we consider the family of zero forcing problems which form the parametric duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that the dual of $\mathsf{Z\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence. In contrast, we show that $\mathsf{L\text{-}Grundy~Domination}$ is $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for that parameter.</description>

      <title>A 13/6-Approximation for Strip Packing via the Bottom-Left Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Strip Packing problem, we are given a vertical strip of fixed width and unbounded height, along with a set of axis-parallel rectangles. The task is to place all rectangles within the strip, without overlaps, while minimizing the height of the packing. This problem is known to be NP-hard. The Bottom-Left Algorithm is a simple and widely used heuristic for Strip Packing. Given a fixed order of the rectangles, it places them one by one, always choosing the lowest feasible position in the strip and, in case of ties, the leftmost one. Baker, Coffman, and Rivest proved in 1980 that the Bottom-Left Algorithm has approximation ratio 3 if the rectangles are sorted by decreasing width. For the past 45 years, no alternative ordering has been found that improves this bound. We introduce a new rectangle ordering and show that with this ordering the Bottom-Left Algorithm achieves a 13/6 approximation for the Strip Packing problem.</description>

Abstract: Real toric manifolds are the real loci of nonsingular complete toric varieties. In this paper, we calculate the integral cohomology groups of real toric manifolds in terms of the combinatorial data contained in the underlying simplicial fans, generalizing a formula due to Cai and Choi. We also present a combinatorial formula to describe the ring structure, modulo the ideal consisting of elements of order $2$. As an application, a combinatorial-algebraic criterion is established for when a real toric manifold is spin$^c$.</description>

      <title>Zero-Freeness is All You Need: A Weitz-Type FPTAS for the Entire Lee-Yang Zero-Free Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Weitz-type FPTAS for the ferromagnetic Ising model across the entire Lee--Yang zero-free region, without relying on the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property. Our algorithm is Weitz-type for two reasons. First, it expresses the partition function as a telescoping product of ratios, with the key being to approximate each ratio. Second, it uses Weitz's self-avoiding walk tree, and truncates it at logarithmic depth to give a good and efficient approximation. The key difference from the standard Weitz algorithm is that we approximate a carefully designed edge-deletion ratio instead of the marginal probability of a vertex being assigned a particular spin, ensuring our algorithm does not require SSM.
  Furthermore, by establishing local dependence of coefficients (LDC), we prove a novel form of SSM for these edge-deletion ratios, which, in turn, implies the standard SSM for the random cluster model. This is the first SSM result for the random cluster model on general graphs, beyond lattices. Our proof of LDC is based on a new divisibility relation, and we show such relations hold quite universally. This leads to a broadly applicable framework for proving LDC across a variety of models, including the Potts model, the hypergraph independence polynomial, and Holant problems. Combined with existing zero-freeness results for these models, we derive new SSM results for them.</description>

      <title>Local Geometric and Transport Properties of Networks that are Generated from Hyperuniform Point Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity, which is a type of long-range order that is characterized by the suppression of long-range density fluctuations in comparison to the fluctuations in standard disordered systems, has emerged as a powerful concept to aid in the understanding of diverse natural and engineered phenomena. In the present paper, we harness hyperuniform point patterns to generate a class of disordered, spatially embedded networks that are distinct from both perfectly ordered lattices and uniformly random geometric graphs. We refer to these networks as \emph{hyperuniform-point-pattern-induced (HuPPI) networks}, and we compare them to their counterpart \emph{Poisson-point-pattern-induced (PoPPI) networks}. By computing the local geometric and transport properties of HuPPI networks, we demonstrate how hyperuniformity imparts advantages in both transport efficiency and robustness. Specifically, we show that HuPPI networks have systematically smaller total effective resistances, slightly faster random-walk mixing times, and fewer extreme-curvature edges than PoPPI networks. Counterintuitively, we also find that HuPPI networks simultaneously have more negative mean Ollivier--Ricci curvatures and smaller total effective resistances than PoPPI networks, indicating that edges with moderately negative curvatures need not create severe bottlenecks to transport. Moreover, HuPPI networks are consistently more robust under both random edge removals and curvature-based targeted edge removals, maintaining larger connected components for larger fractions of removed edges than their PoPPI counterparts. We also demonstrate that the network-generation method strongly influences these properties and in particular that it often overshadows differences that arise from underlying point patterns.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the special subset of the Markov-Lagrange spectrum (and the Markov spectrum) called the discrete Markov spectrum. The discrete Markov spectrum is defined in terms of the Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz.$ Using the tool called snake graphs, originating from cluster algebra theory, we first reconstruct proofs of its properties in a combinatorial framework and then extend it to the generalized setting. We then introduce the generalized discrete Markov spectrum, defined analogously via the generalized Markov numbers, which arise as positive integer solutions to the generalized Markov equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + k_1 yz + k_2 zx + k_3 xy = (3 + k_1 + k_2 + k_3) xyz.$ We prove that this generalized spectrum is contained in the Markov-Lagrange spectrum and thus the Markov spectrum.</description>
