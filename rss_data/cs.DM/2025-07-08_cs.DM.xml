      <title>Combination generators with optimal cache utilization and communication free parallel execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient and elegant combination generator for producing all combinations of size less than or equal to K, designed for exhaustive generation and combinatorial optimization tasks. This generator can be implemented to achieve what we define as optimal efficiency: constant amortized time, optimal cache utilization, embarrassingly parallel execution, and a recursive structure compatible with pruning-based search. These properties are difficult to satisfy simultaneously in existing generators. For example, classical Gray code or lexicographic generators are typically list-based and sequentially defined, making them difficult to vectorized, inefficient in cache usage, and inherently hard to parallelize. Generators based on unranking methods, while easy to parallelize, are non-recursive. These limitations reduce their applicability in our target applications, where both computational efficiency and recursion are crucial. We adapt Bird's algebra of programming-style calculation to derive our algorithms, a formalism for developing correct-by-construction programs from specifications. As a result, all generators in this paper are first formulated in their clearest specification, and efficient definitions are derived constructively through equational reasoning, resulting in concise and elegant divide-and-conquer definitions. Beyond presenting a combination generator, we extend our approach to construct generators for K-permutations, nested combinations of combinations, and nested permutation-combination structures. To the best of our knowledge, the literature has not previously reported generators for these nested structures. We also develop sequential variants that produce configurations in Gray code-compatible orders -- such as the revolving door ordering -- which are particularly useful for constructing nested generators.</description>

      <title>Barvinok's interpolation method meets Weitz's correlation decay approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we take inspiration from Weit'z algorithm for approximating the independence polynomial to provide a new algorithm for computing the coefficients of the Taylor series of the logarithm of the independence polynomial. Hereby we provide a clear connections between Barvinok's interpolation method and Weitz's algorithm. Our algorithm easily extends to other graph polynomials and partition functions and we illustrate this by applying it to the chromatic polynomial and to the graph homomorphism partition function. Our approach arguably yields a simpler and more transparent algorithm than the algorithm of Patel and the second author.
  As an application of our algorithmic approach we moreover derive, using the interpolation method, a deterministic $O(n(m/\varepsilon)^{7})$-time algorithm that on input of an $n$-vertex and $m$-edge graph of minimum degree at least $3$ and $\varepsilon&gt;0$ approximately computes the number of sink-free orientations of $G$ up to a multiplicative $\exp(\varepsilon)$ factor.</description>

      <title>Complexity of learning matchings and half graphs via edge queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of learning or reconstructing an unknown graph from a known family via partial-information queries arises as a mathematical model in various contexts. The most basic type of access to the graph is via \emph{edge queries}, where an algorithm may query the presence/absence of an edge between a pair of vertices of its choosing, at unit cost.
  While more powerful query models have been extensively studied in the context of graph reconstruction, the basic model of edge queries seems to have not attracted as much attention. In this paper we study the edge query complexity of learning a hidden bipartite graph, or equivalently its bipartite adjacency matrix, in the classical as well as quantum settings. We focus on learning matchings and half graphs, which are graphs whose bipartite adjacency matrices are a row/column permutation of the identity matrix and the lower triangular matrix with all entries on and below the principal diagonal being 1, respectively.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item For matchings of size $n$, we show a tight deterministic bound of $n(n-1)/2$ and an asymptotically tight randomized bound of $\Theta(n^2)$. A quantum bound of $\Theta(n^{1.5})$ was shown in a recent work of van Apeldoorn et al.~[ICALP'21].
  \item For half graphs whose bipartite adjacency matrix is a column-permutation of the $n \times n$ lower triangular matrix,
  we give tight $\Theta(n \log n)$ bounds in both deterministic and randomized settings, and an $\Omega(n)$ quantum lower bound. \item For general half graphs,
  we observe that the problem is equivalent to a natural generalization of the famous nuts-and-bolts problem, leading to a tight $\Theta(n \log n)$ randomized bound.
  We also present a simple quicksort-style method that instantiates to a $O(n \log^2 n)$ randomized algorithm and a tight $O(n \log n)$ quantum algorithm.

      <title>Sharp Threshold for Cliques in Random 0/1 Polytope Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study graph-theoretic properties of random $0/1$ polytopes. Specifically, let $Q_p^n \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ be a random subset where each point is included independently with probability $p$, and consider the graph $G_p$ of the polytope conv$(Q_p^n)$. We provide a short and combinatorial proof that $p = 2^{-n/2}$ is a threshold for the edge density of $G_p$, a result originally due to Kaibel and Remshagen. We next resolve an open question from their paper by showing that for $p \leq 2^{-n/2 - o(1)}$, $G_p$ exhibits strong edge expansion. In particular, we prove that, with high probability, every vertex has degree $(1 - o(1))|Q_p^n|$. Lastly, we determine the threshold for $G_p$ being a clique, strengthening a result of Bondarenko and Brodskiy. We show that with high probability, if $p \geq 2^{-\delta n + o(1)}$, then $G_p$ is not a clique, and if $ p \leq 2^{-\delta n - o(1)}$, then $G_p$ is a clique, where $\delta \approx 0.8295$. Our approach combines a combinatorial characterization of edges in graphs arising from polytopes with the Kim-Vu polynomial concentration inequality.</description>

      <title>Generating realistic patient data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing algorithms for real-life problems that perform well in practice highly depends on the availability of realistic data for testing. Obtaining real-life data for optimization problems in health care, however, is often difficult. This is especially true for any patient related optimization problems, e.g., for patient-to-room assignment, due to data privacy policies. Furthermore, obtained real-life data usually cannot be published which prohibits reproducibility of results by other researchers. Therefore, often artificially generated instances are used. In this paper, we present combinatorial insights about the feasibility of instances for the patient-to-room assignment problem (PRA). We use these insights to develop a configurable instance generator for PRA with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. Configurability is in this case especially important as we observed in an extensive analysis of real-life data that, e.g., the probability distribution for patients' age and length of stay depends on the respective ward.</description>

      <title>On Modular Edge Colourings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k\geq 2$, let $\chi'_k(G)$ denote the minimum number of colours required to colour the edges of $G$ such that, in each colour class, the subgraph induced by the edges of that colour has all non-zero degrees congruent to $1$ modulo $k$. In 1992, Pyber proved that $\chi'_2(G) \leq 4$ for every graph $G$, and posed the question of whether $\chi'_k(G)$ can be bounded solely in terms of $k$ for every $k\geq 3$. This question was answered in 1997 by Scott, who showed that $\chi'_k(G)\leq5k^2\log k$, and further asked whether $\chi'_k(G) = O(k)$. Recently, Botler, Colucci, and Kohayakawa (2023) answered Scott's question affirmatively proving that $\chi'_k(G) \leq 198k - 101$, and conjectured that the multiplicative constant could be reduced to $1$. A step towards this latter conjecture was made in 2024 by Nweit and Yang, who improved the bound to $\chi'_k(G) \leq 177k - 93$. In this paper, we further improve the multiplicative constant to $9$. More specifically, we prove that there is a function $f\in o(k)$ for which $\chi'_k(G) \leq 7k + f(k)$ if $k$ is odd, and $\chi'_k(G) \leq 9k + f(k)$ if $k$ is even. In doing so, we prove that $\chi'_k(G) \leq k + O(d)$ for every $d$-degenerate graph $G$, which plays a central role in our proof.</description>

      <title>Short rainbow cycles for families of small edge sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2019, Aharoni proposed a conjecture generalizing the Caceetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture: if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits an edge coloring (not necessarily proper) with $n$ colors such that each color class has size at least $r$, then $G$ contains a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil n/r\rceil$. Recent works \cite{AG2023,ABCGZ2023,G2025} have shown that if a constant fraction of the color classes are non-star, then the rainbow girth is $O(\log n)$. In this note, we extend these results, and we show that even a small fraction of non-star color classes suffices to ensure logarithmic rainbow girth. We also prove that the logarithmic bound is of the right order of magnitude. Moreover, we determine the threshold fraction between the types of color classes at which the rainbow girth transitions from linear to logarithmic.</description>

      <title>Computing Expansions in Infinitely Many Cantor Real Bases via a Single Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing real numbers using convenient numeration systems (integer bases, $\beta$-numeration, Cantor bases, etc.) has been a longstanding mathematical challenge. This paper focuses on Cantor real bases and, specifically, on automatic Cantor real bases and the properties of expansions of real numbers in this setting. We develop a new approach where a single transducer associated with a fixed real number $r$, computes the $\mathbf{B}$-expansion of $r$ but for an infinite family of Cantor real bases $\mathbf{B}$ given as input. This point of view contrasts with traditional computational models for which the numeration system is fixed. Under some assumptions on the finitely many Pisot numbers occurring in the Cantor real base, we show that only a finite part of the transducer is visited. We obtain fundamental results on the structure of this transducer and on decidability problems about these expansions, proving that for certain classes of Cantor real bases, key combinatorial properties such as greediness of the expansion or periodicity can be decided algorithmically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.05569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use algorithmic methods from online learning to explore some important objects at the intersection of model theory and combinatorics, and find natural ways that algorithmic methods can detect and explain (and improve our understanding of) stable structure in the sense of model theory. The main theorem deals with existence of $\epsilon$-excellent sets (which are key to the Stable Regularity Lemma, a theorem characterizing the appearance of irregular pairs in Szemer\'edi's celebrated Regularity Lemma). We prove that $\epsilon$-excellent sets exist for any $\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ in $k$-edge stable graphs in the sense of model theory (equivalently, Littlestone classes); earlier proofs had given this only for $\epsilon &lt; 1/{2^{2^k}}$ or so. We give two proofs: the first uses regret bounds from online learning, the second uses Boolean closure properties of Littlestone classes and sampling. We also give a version of the dynamic Sauer-Shelah-Perles lemma appropriate to this setting, related to definability of types. We conclude by characterizing stable/Littlestone classes as those supporting a certain abstract notion of majority: the proof shows that the two distinct, natural notions of majority, arising from measure and from dimension, densely often coincide.</description>

      <title>Automaticity of spacetime diagrams generated by cellular automata on commutative monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.13062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the spacetime diagrams of some cellular automata have a fractal structure: for instance Pascal's triangle modulo 2 generates a Sierpinski triangle. It has been shown that such patterns can occur when the alphabet is endowed with the structure of an Abelian group, provided the cellular automaton is a morphism with respect to this structure and the initial configuration has finite support. The spacetime diagram then has a property related to k-automaticity. We show that these conditions can be relaxed: the Abelian group can be a commutative monoid, the initial configuration can be k-automatic, and the spacetime diagrams still exhibit the same regularity.</description>

      <title>Clustering Coefficient Reflecting Pairwise Relationships within Hyperedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are generalizations of simple graphs that allow for the representation of complex group interactions beyond pairwise relationships. Clustering coefficients quantify local link density in networks and have been widely studied for both simple graphs and hypergraphs. However, existing clustering coefficients for hypergraphs treat each hyperedge as a distinct unit rather than a collection of potentially related node pairs, failing to capture intra-hyperedge pairwise relationships and incorrectly assigning zero values to nodes with meaningful clustering patterns. We propose a novel clustering coefficient that addresses this fundamental limitation by transforming hypergraphs into weighted graphs, where edge weights reflect relationship strength between nodes based on hyperedge connections. Our definition satisfies three key conditions: values in the range $[0,1]$, consistency with simple graph clustering coefficients, and effective capture of intra-hyperedge pairwise relationships -- a capability absent from existing approaches. Theoretical evaluation on higher-order motifs demonstrates that our definition correctly assigns values to motifs where existing definitions fail (motifs III, IV-a, IV-b of order 3), while empirical evaluation on three real-world datasets shows similar overall clustering tendencies with more detailed measurements, especially for hypergraphs with larger hyperedges. The proposed clustering coefficient enables accurate quantification of local density in complex networks, revealing structural characteristics missed by existing definitions in systems where group membership implies connections between members, such as social communities and co-authorship networks.</description>

      <title>Contributions to conjectures on planar graphs: Induced Subgraphs, Treewidth, and Dominating Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two of the most prominent unresolved conjectures in graph theory, the Albertson-Berman conjecture and the Matheson-Tarjan conjecture, have been extensively studied by many researchers.
  (AB) Every planar graph of order $n$ has an induced forest of order at least $\frac{n}{2}$.
  (MT) Every plane triangulation of sufficiently large order $n$ has a dominating set of cardinality at most $\frac{n}{4}$.
  Although partial progress and weaker bounds are known, both conjectures remain unsolved. To shed further light on them, researchers have explored a variety of related notions and generalizations. In this paper, we clarify relations among several of these notions, most notably connected domination and induced outerplanar subgraphs, and investigate the corresponding open problems. Furthermore, we construct an infinite family of plane triangulations of order $n$ whose connected domination number exceeds $n/3$. This construction gives a negative answer to a question of Bradshaw et al. [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 36 (2022) 1416-1435], who asked whether the maxleaf number of every plane triangulation of order $n$ is at least $2n/3$. We also obtain new results on induced subgraphs with bounded treewidth and induced outerplanar subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Parity conditions for one-way rail networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present parity conditions under which a toy-train rail network is one-way, i.e., every reachable point can be approached from only one direction. We show that this problem is equivalent to determining the balance of a signed graph obtained from the network, whose edges are assigned positive or negative signs. Using signed-graph theory, we derive two equivalent parity conditions for one-wayness: (i) every cycle must contain an even number of edges that join the same sides of switches, and (ii) every cycle must contain an even number of angles at switches. Signed-graph theory also offers an analytical criterion: a connected network is one-way if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its signed Laplacian matrix is zero, suggesting a computational tool for evaluating one-wayness.</description>

      <title>Graphons of Line Graphs</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating graph limits, known as graphons, from observations of sequences of sparse finite graphs. In this paper we show a simple method that can shed light on a subset of sparse graphs. The method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. This enables the use of results on graph limits of dense graphs to derive convergence. In particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. We demonstrate empirically that we can distinguish different numbers of stars (which are sparse) by the graphons of their corresponding line graphs. Whereas in the original graphs, the different number of stars all converge to the zero graphon due to sparsity. Similarly, superlinear preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. II. Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Equivalently, the problem asks if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$, each inducing a connected subgraph, such that contracting each subgraph into a single vertex results in $H$.
  It is known that $H$-IMC is NP-complete for several graphs $H$, even when $H$ is a tree. In this work, we investigate which properties of $H$ guarantee the existence of an induced minor model whose structure can be leveraged to solve the problem in polynomial time. This allows us to identify four infinite families of graphs $H$ that enjoy such properties. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>

      <title>The Planted Spanning Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of detecting and recovering a planted spanning tree $M_n^*$ hidden within a complete, randomly weighted graph $G_n$. Specifically, each edge $e$ has a non-negative weight drawn independently from $P_n$ if $e \in M_n^*$ and from $Q_n$ otherwise, where $P_n \equiv P$ is fixed and $Q_n$ scales with $n$ such that its density at the origin satisfies $\lim_{n\to\infty} n Q'_n(0)=1.$ We consider two representative cases: when $M_n^*$ is either a uniform spanning tree or a uniform Hamiltonian path. We analyze the recovery performance of the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm and derive a fixed-point equation that characterizes the asymptotic fraction of edges in $M_n^*$ successfully recovered by the MST as $n \to \infty.$ Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic mean weight of the MST, extending Frieze's $\zeta(3)$ result to the planted model. Leveraging this result, we design an efficient test based on the MST weight and show that it can distinguish the planted model from the unplanted model with vanishing testing error as $n \to \infty.$ Our analysis relies on an asymptotic characterization of the local structure of the planted model, employing the framework of local weak convergence.</description>
