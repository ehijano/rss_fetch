      <title>Building a Simplistic Automatic Extruder: Instrument Development Opportunities for the Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-rounded introduction to work in a STEM laboratory is vital to scientific education. Besides the ability to use available instrumentation for sample characterization, students should also be imparted knowledge in the steps of instrument development and construction. These concepts can be taught using the example of lipid vesicle preparation via extrusion. Vesicle extrusion is a common technique that involves syringes pushing solutions through membrane filters and is used in fundamental studies on vesicles. Such research is important to better understand of biological phenomena and drug development. Well prepared samples are key to successful research. While the manual approach is very useful to acquire experience, automatic extrusion is more convenient, and automation often results in better reproducibility. These advantages can be combined in a simplistic automatic extruder, that does not require advanced technical skills to be assembled. It can therefore be used by various groups, ranging undergraduate to graduate students using equipment typically available. Using this approach, students can acquire different skillsets including coding, testing, and advanced use of building materials based on their properties. Finally, the quality of the automatic extruder is verified.</description>

      <title>The Bragg Diffraction Experiment Based on Ultrasonic Wave and Artificial Crystal Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional Bragg crystal diffraction experiments use X-rays, harming the participants bodies. Therefore, many universities have not offered this basic experiment. Although microwave simulation Bragg experiments can reduce harm, there are still some potential dangers. To solve this dilemma, this article takes ultrasound as the experimental object and uses an artificial simulation of crystals to successfully achieve the Bragg crystal diffraction effect of crystals, which is in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. This experiment is expected to be widely deployed in physics, chemistry, materials, and other science and engineering majors as a basic teaching experiment.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Approach and Coherent States for the Modified Dirac Oscillator in Curved Spacetime with Spin and Pseudospin Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate and solve exactly the modified Dirac oscillator in curved spacetime with spin and pseudospin symmetries through an algebraic approach. By focusing on the radial part of this problem, we use the Schr\"odinger factorization method to show that this problem possesses an SU(1; 1) symmetry. This symmetry allowed us to obtain the wave functions and their corresponding energy spectrum. From these results, we calculate the radial coherent states of the modified Dirac oscillator and their temporal evolution in the spin and pseudospin limits, respectively.</description>

      <title>From Fourier to Neural ODEs: Flow matching for modeling complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network. Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction, and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework using a number of representative complex systems.</description>
