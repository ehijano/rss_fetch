      <title>Information-Energy Capacity Region for SLIPT Systems over Lognormal Fading Channels: A Theoretical and Learning-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the information-energy capacity region for simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) systems over lognormal fading channels. Unlike conventional studies that primarily focus on additive white Gaussian noise channels, we study the complex impact of lognormal fading, which is prevalent in optical wireless communication systems such as underwater and atmospheric channels. By applying the Smith's framework for these channels, we demonstrate that the optimal input distribution is discrete, characterized by a finite number of mass points. We further investigate the properties of these mass points, especially at the transition points, to reveal critical insights into the rate-power trade-off inherent in SLIPT systems. Additionally, we introduce a novel cooperative information-energy capacity learning framework, leveraging generative adversarial networks, to effectively estimate and optimize the information-energy capacity region under practical constraints. Numerical results validate our theoretical findings, illustrating the significant influence of channel fading on system performance. The insights and methodologies presented in this work provide a solid foundation for the design and optimization of future SLIPT systems operating in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Transform for Fractional Programs in Signal Processing and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional programming (FP) is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with the optimization of ratios. It is an invaluable tool for signal processing and machine learning, because many key metrics in these fields are fractionally structured, e.g., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in wireless communications, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) in radar sensing, the normalized cut in graph clustering, and the margin in support vector machine (SVM). This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix ratio problems.</description>

      <title>Finite Field Multiple Access II:from Symbol-wise to Codeword-wise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite-field multiple-access (FFMA) system separates users within a finite field by utilizing different element-pairs (EPs) as virtual resources. The Cartesian product of distinct EPs forms an EP code, which serves as the input to a finite-field multiplexing module (FF-MUX), allowing the FFMA technique to interchange the order of channel coding and multiplexing. This flexibility enables the FFMA system to support a large number of users with short packet traffic, addressing the finite block length (FBL) problem in multiuser reliable transmission. Designing EP codes is a central challenge in FFMA systems. In this paper, we construct EP codes based on a bit(s)-to-codeword transformation approach and define the corresponding EP code as a codeword-wise EP (CWEP) code. We then investigate the encoding process of EP codes, and propose unique sum-pattern mapping (USPM) structural property constraints to design uniquely decodable CWEP codes. Next, we present the \(\kappa\)-fold ternary orthogonal matrix \({\bf T}_{\rm o}(2^{\kappa}, 2^{\kappa})\) over GF\((3^m)\), where \(m = 2^{\kappa}\), and the ternary non-orthogonal matrix \({\bf T}_{\rm no}(3,2)\) over GF\((3^2)\), for constructing specific CWEP codes. Based on the proposed CWEP codes, we introduce three FFMA modes: channel codeword multiple access (FF-CCMA), code division multiple access (FF-CDMA), and non-orthogonal multiple access (FF-NOMA). Simulation results demonstrate that all three modes effectively support massive user transmissions with strong error performance.</description>

      <title>Towards Manufacturing-Friendly Shapes in Discrete Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with shape irregularity issues in discrete topology optimization algorithms whereby the design is created using the automated distribution of material in the design region. Graph theory is employed to derive appropriate regularity measures for any discrete optimization algorithm. Shape regularity is quantified by scalar figures ready to evaluate design choices in the form of Pareto-frontiers. Developed metrics deal with information concerning material usage, problematic distribution, and features that complicate manufacturing. The theory is verified by several examples demonstrating the treatment of isolated islands of materials, point connections between material segments, or homogeneity.</description>

      <title>Building Intelligent Databases through Similarity: Interaction of Logical and Qualitative Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present a novel method for assessing the similarity of information within knowledge-bases using a logical point of view. This proposal introduces the concept of a similarity property space $\Xi$P for each knowledge K, offering a nuanced approach to understanding and quantifying similarity. By defining the similarity knowledge space $\Xi$K through its properties and incorporating similarity source information, the framework reinforces the idea that similarity is deeply rooted in the characteristics of the knowledge being compared. Inclusion of super-categories within the similarity knowledge space $\Xi$K allows for a hierarchical organization of knowledge, facilitating more sophisticated analysis and comparison. On the one hand, it provides a structured framework for organizing and understanding similarity. The existence of super-categories within this space further allows for hierarchical organization of knowledge, which can be particularly useful in complex domains. On the other hand, the finite nature of these categories might be restrictive in certain contexts, especially when dealing with evolving or highly nuanced forms of knowledge. Future research and applications of this framework focus on addressing its potential limitations, particularly in handling dynamic and highly specialized knowledge domains.</description>

      <title>On the List-Decodability of Random (Linear) Sum-Rank Metric Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the list-decoding capacity theorem for sum-rank metric codes. This theorem implies the list-decodability theorem for random general sum-rank metric codes: Any random general sum-rank metric code with a rate not exceeding the list-decoding capacity is $\left(\rho,O\left(1/\epsilon\right)\right)$-list-decodable with high probability, where $\rho\in\left(0,1\right)$ represents the error fraction and $\epsilon&gt;0$ is referred to as the capacity gap. For random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sum-rank metric codes by using the same proof approach we demonstrate that any random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sum-rank metric code with a rate not exceeding the list-decoding capacity is $\left(\rho,\exp\left(O\left(1/\epsilon\right)\right)\right)$-list-decodable with high probability, where the list size is exponential at this stage due to the high correlation among codewords in linear codes. To achieve an exponential improvement on the list size, we prove a limited correlation property between sum-rank metric balls and $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces. Ultimately, we establish the list-decodability theorem for random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sum-rank metric codes: Any random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sum-rank metric code with rate not exceeding the list decoding capacity is $\left(\rho, O\left(1/\epsilon\right)\right)$-list-decodable with high probability. For the proof of the list-decodability theorem of random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear sum-rank metric codes our proof idea is inspired by and aligns with that provided in the works \cite{Gur2010,Din2014,Gur2017} where the authors proved the list-decodability theorems for random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear Hamming metric codes and random $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear rank metric codes, respectively.</description>

      <title>The LZ78 Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of processes generated according to sequential probability assignments induced by the LZ78 universal compressor. We characterize entropic and distributional properties such as their entropy and relative entropy rates, finite-state compressibility and log loss of their realizations, and the empirical distributions that they induce. Though not quite stationary, these sources are "almost stationary and ergodic;" similar to stationary and ergodic processes, they satisfy a Shannon-McMillan-Breiman-type property: the normalized log probability of their realizations converges almost surely to their entropy rate. Further, they are locally "almost i.i.d." in the sense that the finite-dimensional empirical distributions of their realizations converge almost surely to a deterministic i.i.d. law. However, unlike stationary ergodic sources, the finite-state compressibility of their realizations is almost surely strictly larger than their entropy rate by a "Jensen gap." We present simulations demonstrating the theoretical results. Among their potential uses, these sources allow to gauge the performance of sequential probability models on non-Markovian non-stationary data.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry for Modeling and Analysis of Sensing and Communications: A Survey</title>

Abstract: One of the most promising technologies for next-generation wireless networks is integrated communication and sensing (ISAC). It is considered a key enabler for applications that require both enhanced communication and accurate sensing capabilities. Examples of such applications include smart environments, augmented and virtual reality, or the internet of things, where the capabilities of intelligent sensing and broadband communications are vital. Therefore, ISAC has attracted the research interest of both academia and industry, and many investigations have been carried out over the past decade. The articles in the literature include system models, performance evaluation, and optimization studies of several ISAC alternative designs. Stochastic geometry is the study and analysis of random spatial patterns, and as such, stochastic geometry tools have been considered for the performance evaluation of wireless networks with different types of nodes. In this paper, we aim to provide a comprehensive survey of current research progress in performance evaluation of ISAC systems using stochastic geometry tools. The survey covers terrestrial, aerial, and vehicular networks, where the random spatial location of the corresponding network elements and propagation scatterers and/or blockages is treated with various point processes. The paper starts with a short tutorial on ISAC technology, stochastic geometry tools, and metrics used in performance evaluation of communication and sensing. Then, the technical components of the system models utilized in the surveyed papers are discussed. Subsequently, we present the key results of the literature in all types of networks using three levels of integration: sensing-assisted communication, communication-assisted sensing, and joint sensing and communication. Finally, future research challenges and promising directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>On an analogue of the doubling method in coding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theories of automorphic forms and self-dual linear codes share many remarkable analogies. In both worlds there are functions invariant under an action of a group, notions of cusp forms and Hecke operators, also projections and lifts between different geni. It is then natural to ask if other important automorphic objects or techniques could be introduced into coding theory. In this article we propose a way to introduce the doubling method, an efficient technique used to construct and study $L$-functions. As a result, we prove the so-called doubling identity, which usually forms a base of many applications. Here we use it to solve an analogue of the "basis problem". Namely, we express a cusp form as an explicit linear combination of complete weight enumerators of the same type.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Wigner Distribution in the Linear Canonical Transform Domain: Theory and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper devotes to combine the chirp basis function transformation and symplectic coordinates transformation to yield a novel Wigner distribution (WD) associated with the linear canonical transform (LCT), named as the symplectic WD in the LCT domain (SWDL). It incorporates the merits of the symplectic WD (SWD) and the WD in the LCT domain (WDL), achieving stronger capability in the linear frequency-modulated (LFM) signal frequency rate feature extraction while maintaining the same level of computational complexity. Some essential properties of the SWDL are derived, including marginal distributions, energy conservations, unique reconstruction, Moyal formula, complex conjugate symmetry, time reversal symmetry, scaling property, time translation property, frequency modulation property, and time translation and frequency modulation property. Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the SWDL are formulated, giving rise to three kinds of lower bounds attainable respectively by Gaussian enveloped complex exponential signal, Gaussian signal and Gaussian enveloped chirp signal. The optimal symplectic matrices corresponding to the highest time-frequency resolution are generated by solving the lower bound optimization (minimization) problem. The time-frequency resolution of the SWDL is compared with those of the SWD and WDL to demonstrate its superiority in LFM signals time-frequency energy concentration. A synthesis example is also carried out to verify the feasibility and reliability of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of Cohen's class time-frequency distribution with specific kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-frequency concentration and resolution of the Cohen's class time-frequency distribution (CCTFD) has attracted much attention in time-frequency analysis. A variety of uncertainty principles of the CCTFD is therefore derived, including the weak Heisenberg type, the Hardy type, the Nazarov type, and the local type. However, the standard Heisenberg type still remains unresolved. In this study, we address the question of how the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principle of the CCTFD is affected by fundamental properties. The investigated distribution properties are Parseval's relation and the concise frequency domain definition (i.e., only frequency variables are explicitly found in the tensor product), based on which we confine our attention to the CCTFD with some specific kernels. That is the unit modulus and v-independent time translation, reversal and scaling invariant kernel CCTFD (UMITRSK-CCTFD). We then extend the standard Heisenberg's uncertainty principles of the Wigner distribution to those of the UMITRSK-CCTFD, giving birth to various types of attainable lower bounds on the uncertainty product in the UMITRSK-CCTFD domain. The derived results strengthen the existing weak Heisenberg type and fill gaps in the standard Heisenberg type.</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antennas for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose to deploy rotatable antennas (RAs) at the base station (BS) to enhance both communication and sensing (C&amp;S) performances, by exploiting a new spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) offered by array rotation. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the sum-rate of multiple communication users and minimize the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for target angle estimation, by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vectors and the array rotation angle at the BS. To solve this problem, we first equivalently decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization and an outer problem for array rotation optimization. Although these two subproblems are non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by applying the block coordinate descent (BCD) technique and one-dimensional exhaustive search, respectively. Moreover, we show that for the communication-only case, RAs provide an additional rotation gain to improve communication performance; while for the sensing-only case, the equivalent spatial aperture can be enlarged by RAs for achieving higher sensing accuracy. Finally, numerical results are presented to showcase the performance gains of RAs over fixed-rotation antennas in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC).</description>

      <title>An Achievable Rate Region for $3-$User Classical-Quantum Broadcast Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.00110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of communicating on a $3\mhyphen$user classical-quantum broadcast channel. We undertake an information theoretic study and focus on the problem of characterizing an inner bound to its capacity region. We design a new coding scheme based \textit{partitioned coset codes} - an ensemble of codes possessing algebraic properties. Analyzing its information-theoretic performance, we characterize a new inner bound. We identify examples for which the derived inner bound is strictly larger than that achievable using IID random codes.
  Proceeding further, we incorporate Sen's technique of tilting smoothing and augmentation to perform simultaneous decoding via a simultaneous decoding POVM and thereby characterize a further enlarged achievable rate region for communicating classical bits over the $3-$user classical-quantum broadcast channel. Finally, in our last step, we characterize a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of the $3-$user classical-quantum broadcast channel that subsumes all previous known inner bounds by combining the conventional unstructured IID codes with structured coset code strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of large graphs requires measures that extend beyond predefined structural features and scale efficiently with graph size. This work adopts a generative perspective, modeling large networks as exchangeable graphs to quantify the information content of their generating mechanisms via graphon entropy. As a graph property, graphon entropy is invariant under isomorphisms, making it an effective measure of complexity; however, it is not directly computable. To address this, we introduce a suite of graphon entropy estimators, including a nonparametric estimator for broad applicability and specialized versions for structured graphons arising from well-studied random graph models such as Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, Chung-Lu, and stochastic block models. We establish their large-sample properties, deriving convergence rates and Central Limit Theorems. Simulations illustrate how the nonparametric graphon entropy estimator captures structural variations in graphs, while real-world applications demonstrate its role in characterizing evolving network dynamics.</description>

      <title>Age of Synchronization Minimization in Wireless Networks with Random Updates and Time-Varying Timeliness Requirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study considers a wireless network where multiple nodes transmit status updates to a base station (BS) via a shared, error-free channel with limited bandwidth. The status updates arrive at each node randomly. We use the Age of Synchronization (AoS) as a metric to measure the information freshness of the updates. The AoS of each node has a timely-varying importance which follows a Markov chain. Our objective is to minimize the weighted sum AoS of the system. The optimization problem is relaxed and formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). Solving the relaxed CMDP by a linear programming algorithm yields a stationary policy, which helps us propose a near-stationary policy for the original problem. Numerical simulations show that in most configurations, the AoS performance of our policy outperforms the policy choosing the maximum AoS regardless of weight variations.</description>

      <title>Structured Codes for Distributed Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00371v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our work addresses the well-known open problem of distributed computing of bilinear functions of two correlated sources ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$. In a setting with two nodes, with the first node having access to ${\bf A}$ and the second to ${\bf B}$, we establish bounds on the optimal sum-rate that allows a receiver to compute an important class of non-linear functions, and in particular bilinear functions, including dot products $\langle {\bf A},{\bf B}\rangle$, and general matrix products ${\bf A}^{\intercal}{\bf B}$ over finite fields. The bounds are tight, for large field sizes, for which case we can derive the exact fundamental performance limits for all problem dimensions and a large class of sources. Our achievability scheme involves the design of non-linear transformations of ${\bf A}$ and ${\bf B}$, which are carefully calibrated to work synergistically with the structured linear encoding scheme by K\"orner and Marton. The subsequent converse derived here, calibrates the Han-Kobayashi approach to yield a relatively tight converse on the sum rate. We also demonstrate unbounded compression gains over Slepian-Wolf coding, depending on the source correlations. In the end, our work derives fundamental limits for distributed computing of a crucial class of functions, succinctly capturing the computation structures and source correlations.
  Our findings are subsequently applied to the practical master-workers-receiver framework, where each of $N$ distributed workers has a bounded memory reflecting a bounded computational capability. By combining the above scheme with the polynomial code framework, we design novel structured polynomial codes for distributed matrix multiplication, and show that our codes can surpass the performance of the existing state of art, while also adapting these new codes to support chain matrix multiplications and information-theoretically secure computations.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Decoding of Classical Coset Codes over $3-$User Quantum Interference Channel : New Achievable Rate Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</description>

      <title>On H-Intersecting Graph Families and Counting of Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work derives an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of a family of graphs on a fixed number of vertices, in which the intersection of every two graphs in that family contains a subgraph that is isomorphic to a specified graph H. Such families are referred to as H-intersecting graph families. The bound is derived using the combinatorial version of Shearer's lemma, and it forms a nontrivial extension of the bound derived by Chung, Graham, Frankl, and Shearer (1986), where H is specialized to a triangle. The derived bound is expressed in terms of the chromatic number of H, while a relaxed version, formulated using the Lov\'{a}sz $\vartheta$-function of the complement of H, offers reduced computational complexity. Additionally, a probabilistic version of Shearer's lemma, combined with properties of the Shannon entropy, are employed to establish bounds related to the enumeration of graph homomorphisms, providing further insights into the interplay between combinatorial structures and information-theoretic principles.</description>
