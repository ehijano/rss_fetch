      <title>Enhancing Efficiency of Local Projections Estimation with Volatility Clustering in High-Frequency Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances the local projections (LP) method by addressing its inefficiency in high-frequency economic and financial data with volatility clustering. We incorporate a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) process to resolve serial correlation issues and extend the model with GARCH-X and GARCH-HAR structures. Monte Carlo simulations show that exploiting serial dependence in LP error structures improves efficiency across forecast horizons, remains robust to persistent volatility, and yields greater gains as sample size increases. Our findings contribute to refining LP estimation, enhancing its applicability in analyzing economic interventions and financial market dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Realized Joint Laplace Transform of Volatilities with Application to Test the Volatility Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first investigate the estimation of the empirical joint Laplace transform of volatilities of two semi-martingales within a fixed time interval [0, T] by using overlapped increments of high-frequency data. The proposed estimator is robust to the presence of finite variation jumps in price processes. The related functional central limit theorem for the proposed estimator has been established. Compared with the estimator with non-overlapped increments, the estimator with overlapped increments improves the asymptotic estimation efficiency. Moreover, we study the asymptotic theory of estimator under a long-span setting and employ it to create a feasible test for the dependence between volatilities. Finally, simulation and empirical studies demonstrate the performance of proposed estimators.</description>

      <title>Extrapolating the long-term seasonal component of electricity prices for forecasting in the day-ahead market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies provide evidence that decomposing the electricity price into the long-term seasonal component (LTSC) and the remaining part, predicting both separately, and then combining their forecasts can bring significant accuracy gains in day-ahead electricity price forecasting. However, not much attention has been paid to predicting the LTSC, and the last 24 hourly values of the estimated pattern are typically copied for the target day. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach which extracts the trend-seasonal pattern from a price series extrapolated using price forecasts for the next 24 hours. We assess it using two 5-year long test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, covering the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2021/2022 energy crisis, and the war in Ukraine. Considering parsimonious autoregressive and LASSO-estimated models, we find that improvements in predictive accuracy range from 3\% to 15\% in terms of the root mean squared error and exceed 1\% in terms of profits from a realistic trading strategy involving day-ahead bidding and battery storage.</description>

      <title>The Mixed Aggregate Preference Logit Model: A Machine Learning Approach to Modeling Unobserved Heterogeneity in Discrete Choice Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Mixed Aggregate Preference Logit (MAPL, pronounced "maple'') model, a novel class of discrete choice models that leverages machine learning to model unobserved heterogeneity in discrete choice analysis. The traditional mixed logit model (also known as "random parameters logit'') parameterizes preference heterogeneity through assumptions about feature-specific heterogeneity distributions. These parameters are also typically assumed to be linearly added in a random utility (or random regret) model. MAPL models relax these assumptions by instead directly relating model inputs to parameters of alternative-specific distributions of aggregate preference heterogeneity, with no feature-level assumptions required. MAPL models eliminate the need to make any assumption about the functional form of the latent decision model, freeing modelers from potential misspecification errors. In a simulation experiment, we demonstrate that a single MAPL model specification is capable of correctly modeling multiple different data-generating processes with different forms of utility and heterogeneity specifications. MAPL models advance machine-learning-based choice models by accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. Further, MAPL models can be leveraged by traditional choice modelers as a diagnostic tool for identifying utility and heterogeneity misspecification.</description>

      <title>Conditional Rank-Rank Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rank-rank regression is commonly employed in economic research as a way of capturing the relationship between two economic variables. It frequently features in studies of intergenerational mobility as the resulting coefficient, capturing the rank correlation between the variables, is easy to interpret and measures overall persistence. However, in many applications it is common practice to include other covariates to account for differences in persistence levels between groups defined by the values of these covariates. In these instances the resulting coefficients can be difficult to interpret. We propose the conditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of unconditional ranks, to measure average within-group persistence. The difference between conditional and unconditional rank-rank regression coefficients can then be interpreted as a measure of between-group persistence. We develop a flexible estimation approach using distribution regression and establish a theoretical framework for large sample inference. An empirical study on intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland demonstrates the advantages of this approach. The study reveals stronger intergenerational persistence between fathers and sons compared to fathers and daughters, with the within-group persistence explaining 62% of the overall income persistence for sons and 52% for daughters. Smaller families and those with highly educated fathers exhibit greater persistence in economic status.</description>

      <title>Normal Approximation for U-Statistics with Cross-Sectional Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish normal approximation in the Wasserstein metric and central limit theorems for both non-degenerate and degenerate U-statistics with cross-sectionally dependent samples using Stein's method. For the non-degenerate case, our results extend recent studies on the asymptotic properties of sums of cross-sectionally dependent random variables. The degenerate case is more challenging due to the additional dependence induced by the nonlinearity of the U-statistic kernel. Through a specific implementation of Stein's method, we derive convergence rates under conditions on the mixing rate, the sparsity of the cross-sectional dependence structure, and the moments of the U-statistic kernel. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our theoretical results with a nonparametric specification test for data with cross-sectional dependence.</description>

      <title>The Transfer Performance of Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04796v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Economists often estimate models using data from a particular domain, e.g. estimating risk preferences in a particular subject pool or for a specific class of lotteries. Whether a model's predictions extrapolate well across domains depends on whether the estimated model has captured generalizable structure. We provide a tractable formulation for this "out-of-domain" prediction problem and define the transfer error of a model based on how well it performs on data from a new domain. We derive finite-sample forecast intervals that are guaranteed to cover realized transfer errors with a user-selected probability when domains are iid, and use these intervals to compare the transferability of economic models and black box algorithms for predicting certainty equivalents. We find that in this application, the black box algorithms we consider outperform standard economic models when estimated and tested on data from the same domain, but the economic models generalize across domains better than the black-box algorithms do.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood Adaptive Estimators for Causal Inference under Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal effects has become an integral part of most applied fields. In this work we consider the violation of the classical no-interference assumption with units connected by a network. For tractability, we consider a known network that describes how interference may spread. Unlike previous work the radius (and intensity) of the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on different (local) sub-networks and the assigned treatments. We study estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated in such a setting under additive treatment effects. We establish rates of convergence and distributional results. The proposed estimators considers all possible radii for each (local) treatment assignment pattern. In contrast to previous work, we approximate the relevant network interference patterns that lead to good estimates of the interference. To handle feature engineering, a key innovation is to propose the use of synthetic treatments to decouple the dependence. We provide simulations, an empirical illustration and insights for the general study of interference.</description>

      <title>Gradients can train reward models: An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>
