      <title>Theory of itinerant collisional spin dynamics in nondegenerate molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fully itinerant dynamics of ultracold but nondegenerate polar molecules with a spin-$1/2$ degree of freedom encoded into two of their electric field dressed rotational states. Center of mass molecular motion is constrained to two-dimensions via tight confinement with a one-dimensional optical lattice, but remains mostly unconstrained within the plane. The pseudospins can become entangled through ultracold dipolar collisions, for which the locality of interactions is greatly relaxed by free molecular motion. At the level of single-molecule observables, collision-induced entanglement manifests as spin decoherence, for which our theoretical calculations serve well to describe recent Ramsey contrast measurements of quasi-2D confined KRb molecules at JILA [A. Carroll et al., Science 388 6745 (2025)]. In presenting a more detailed theoretical analysis of the KRb experiment, we highlight a key finding that molecular loss enhanced by particle exchange symmetry can lead to a suppression of collective spin decoherence, a mechanism with refer to as ``loss-induced quantum autoselection". We then show that by utilizing bialkali species with sufficiently large dipole moments, loss can be near completely suppressed in all collision channels via electric field tunable confinement-induced collisional shielding. The afforded collisional stability permits fully coherent spin mixing dynamics, natively realizing unitary circuit dynamics with random all-to-all connectivity and U(1) charge conservation. This work establishes a bridge between the domains of ultracold molecular collisions and many-body spin physics, ultimately proposing the use of nondegenerate bulk molecular gases as a controllable platform for nonequilibrium explorations of itinerant quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Universal principles for sudden-quench quantum Otto engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a simple sudden quench approximation for the unitary work strokes of a quantum Otto engine in order to provide a general analysis of its performance, applicable to arbitrary quantum models with two-body interactions. This work extends recent results for an interaction-driven Otto cycle to generic many-body interacting quantum models, providing universal bounds on their operation efficiency. From this, we demonstrate that the net work of such an engine cycle is determined entirely by interparticle correlations. Applications are demonstrated for a handful of paradigmatic many-body quantum models, including a novel engine -- with a spin-1/2 Fermi gas with contact two-body interactions as its working medium -- in which we leverage control over spin polarization to greatly enhance its performance compared to the unpolarized case. We then extend the analysis of interaction-driven quantum Otto engine cycles to systems where control is exerted over the strength of arbitrary quantum operators that might be present in the system Hamiltonian (such as one-body, or three-body, etc.), finding that the general principles derived for the sudden quench with two-body interactions apply universally. As an example, this is demonstrated for a conventional volumetric Otto cycle, where beneficial net work is generated by leveraging the control over the frequency of an external trap, which is a one-body operator. However, we emphasize that the results derived here apply universally to all Otto engine cycles operating under a sudden quench protocol.</description>

      <title>Effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effective potential and scattering length of ultracold polar molecules under different shielding techniques. First, we derive the effective potential for two polar molecules in the presence of an elliptical polarization field, combined elliptical and linear polarization fields, and combined elliptical polarization and static fields. The effective potential is then expressed as a sum of a zero-range contact interaction and a long-range dipole-dipole interaction under the Born approximation. We find that the first two shielding methods only partially suppress attractive interactions, while the second method allows for the construction of bound states with different polarization shapes. The last shielding method can achieve complete cancellation of residual attractive forces, which is particularly significant for maintaining quantum degeneracy in ultracold dipolar systems. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the effective potential and scattering length of shielding polar molecules, which is crucial for studying many-body physics in ultracold dipolar systems.</description>

      <title>Localization behavior in a Hermitian and non-Hermitian Raman lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible Raman lattice system for alakaline-earth like atoms to investigate localization behaviors in a quasi-periodic lattice with controllable non-Hermiticity. We demonstrate that critical phases and mobility edges can arise by adjusting spin-dependence of the incommensurate potentials in the Hermitian regime. With non-Hermiticity introduced by spin-selective atom loss, we find the localization behaviour in this system can be suppressed by dissipation. Our work provides insights into interplay between quasi-periodicity and non-Hermitian physics, offering a new perspective on localization phenomena.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurement of Spin-Dependent Dipolar Splitting in $^6$Li p-Wave Feshbach Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic dipolar splitting of a p-wave Feshbach resonance is governed by the spin-orbital configuration of the valence electrons in the triplet molecular state. We perform high-resolution trap loss spectroscopy on ultracold 6Li atoms to resolve this splitting with sub-milligauss precision. By comparing spin-polarized (|mS| = 1) and spin-mixture (mS = 0) configurations of the triplet state, we observe a clear spin-dependent reversal in the splitting structure, confirmed via momentumresolved absorption imaging. This behavior directly reflects the interplay between electron spin projection mS and orbital angular momentum ml in the molecular states. Our results provide a stringent benchmark for dipole-dipole interaction models and lay the groundwork for controlling the pairing in p-wave superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Dynamical Quantum Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems of quantum statistical physics is, how an ideally isolated quantum system can ever reach thermal equilibrium behavior despite the unitary time evolution of quantum-mechanical systems. Here we study by explicit time evolution for the generic model system of an interacting, trapped Bose gas with discrete single-particle levels, how the measurement of one or more observables subdivides the system into observed and non-observed Hilbert subspaces and the tracing over the non-measured quantum numbers defines an effective, thermodynamic bath, induces entanglement of the observed Hilbert subspace with the bath, and leads to bi-exponential approach of the entanglement entropy and of the measured observables to thermal equilibrium behavior as a function of time. We find this to be more generally fulfilled than in the scenario of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), namely for both local particle occupation numbers and non-local density correlation functions, and independent of the specific initial quantum state of the time evolution.</description>

      <title>A multimode cavity QED Ising spin glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a driven-dissipative Ising spin glass using cavity QED in a novel ``4/7" multimode geometry. Gases of ultracold atoms trapped within the cavity by optical tweezers serve as effective spins. They are coupled via randomly signed, all-to-all Ising cavity-mediated interactions. Networks of up to n = 25 spins are holographically imaged via cavity emission. The system is driven through a frustrated transverse-field Ising transition, and we show that the entropy of the spin glass states depends on the rate at which the transition is crossed. Despite being intrinsically nonequilibrium, the system exhibits phenomena associated with Parisi's theory of equilibrium spin glasses, namely replica symmetry breaking (RSB) and ultrametric structure. For system sizes up to n = 16, we measure the Parisi function q(x), Edwards-Anderson overlap q_EA, and ultrametricity K-correlator; all indicate a deeply ordered spin glass under RSB. The system can serve as an associative memory and enable aging and rejuvenation studies in driven-dissipative spin glasses at the microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Boson-Anyon-Fermion Mapping and Anyon Construction in One Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an exact mapping between identical particles in one dimension with arbitrary exchange statistics, including bosons, anyons and fermions, provided they share the same scattering length. This boson-anyon-fermion mapping facilitates the construction of anyons from a linear superposition of spatially symmetric and anti-symmetric states. This scheme is general and has been demonstrated in a spin-1/2 Fermi gas, where both s- and p-wave bound states can be supported by manipulating spin channels. With a suitable symmetry-breaking field, these bound states are hybridized to form a fractional-wave molecule. The condensation of these molecules in a many-body system leads to anyonic superfluidity, characterized by fractional statistics upon spin exchange within a Cooper pair. These anyonic states can be detected through asymmetric momentum distributions for each spin with a chiral $k^{-3}$ tail. Our results have demonstrated the inadequacy of contact interaction model for anyons in continuum and lattices, and meanwhile proposed a convenient route for engineering fractional phases in the platform of ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Bogolon-mediated electromagnetic wave absorption in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic wave absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory for electromagnetic wave absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</description>

      <title>Extended Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker Formula for Current through Open Quantum Systems with Gain or Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formula, which characterizes the current flowing through a finite region connected to leads, has significantly advanced our understanding of transport. We extend this formula to describe particle and energy currents with gain or loss in the intermediate region by using the Lindblad-Keldysh formalism. Based on the derived formula, several novel effects induced by gain or loss in the current are discussed: the breaking of inversion symmetry in the gain and loss terms or in the system can lead to current generation; the anomalous phenomenon that disorder can induce current generation; the presence of gain and loss makes the thermal and electrical conductances continuous and ensures they follow the Wiedemann-Franz law even outside the energy band; the effect of bond loss-induced skin effect on current. This work deepens and extends our understanding of transport phenomena in open systems.</description>

      <title>A local quantized marker for topological magnons from circular dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of a spin system can display Bloch bands with non-trivial topological properties. While topological magnons can be identified through the detection of chiral propagating modes at the sample's edge, an intriguing approach would be to directly probe their topological nature via localized measurements deep within the bulk. In this work, we introduce a quantized topological marker suitable for topological spin systems, which can be experimentally accessed by combining a local driven-dissipative preparation scheme with a circular-dichroic measurement. Demonstrated on a 2D ferromagnetic Heisenberg spin system incorporating Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, this method effectively maps a local Chern marker with single-site resolution while inherently accounting for magnon losses. Our work offers a general strategy to access local topological markers in bosonic settings within a driven-dissipative framework.</description>
