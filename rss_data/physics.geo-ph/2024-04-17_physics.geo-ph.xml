      <title>On the use of time series to improve signal processing of electrical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) has become widely used for engineering and environmental applications in the last couple of decades due to (1) the simplification and automating of resistivity meters and (2) the new generation of inversion software. Although the initial domain of application remain relevant today, these techniques are increasingly used for deep investigation and shallow environmental/geotechnical applications. These new applications involve working with complex resistivity, which can be measured in the time domain (TDIP: Time Domain Induce Polarization) or frequency domain (SIP: Spectral Induce Polarization). The new algorithm could process data in time and frequency domain. The first step is to estimate the no linear self-potential in order to remove it. Second step is to compute resistivity and chargeability in time or frequency domain. The results show that the improvement of the processing is weak for the resistivity and for no noisy data but we have a better estimation of chargeability. The correlation highlight a good correlation between calculated out-phasing (in frequency domain) and chargeability (in time domain).</description>

      <title>Measurement of Snowpack Density, Grain Size, and Black Carbon Concentration Using Time-domain Diffuse Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) techniques aim to characterize scattering media by examining their optical response to laser illumination. Time-domain DOS methods involve illuminating the medium with a laser pulse and using a fast photodetector to measure the time-dependent intensity of light that exits the medium after multiple scattering events. While DOS research traditionally focused on characterizing biological tissues, we demonstrate that time-domain diffuse optical measurements can also be used to characterize snow. We introduce a model that predicts the time-dependent reflectance of a dry snowpack as a function of its density, grain size, and black carbon content, and we develop an algorithm that retrieves these properties from measurements at two wavelengths. To validate our approach, we use a two-wavelength lidar system and measure the time-dependent reflectance of snow samples with varying properties. Rather than measuring direct surface returns, our system captures photons that enter and exit the snow at different points, separated by a small distance (4-10cm). We find strong, linear correlations between our retrievals of density and black carbon concentration, and ground truth measurements. Although the correlation is not as strong, we also find that our method is capable of distinguishing between small and large grains.</description>
