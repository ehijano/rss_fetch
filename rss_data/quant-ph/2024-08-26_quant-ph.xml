      <title>Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks: Generating and Detecting Quantum Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning can be used as a systematic method to non-algorithmically program quantum computers. Quantum machine learning enables us to perform computations without breaking down an algorithm into its gate building blocks, eliminating that difficult step and potentially reducing unnecessary complexity. In addition, the machine learning approach is robust to both noise and to decoherence, which is ideal for running on inherently noisy NISQ devices which are limited in the number of qubits available for error correction. Here we apply our prior work in quantum machine learning technique, to create a QGAN, a quantum analog to the classical Stylenet GANs developed by Kerras for image generation and classification. A quantum system is used as a generator and a separate quantum system is used as a discriminator. The generator Hamiltonian quantum parameters are augmented by quantum style parameters which play the role of the style parameters used by Kerras. Both generator parameters are trained in a GAN MinMax problem along with quantum parameters of the discriminator Hamiltonian. We choose a problem to demonstrate the QGAN that has purely quantum information. The task is to generate and discriminate quantum product states. Real product states are generated to be detected and separated from fake quantum product states generated by the quantum generator. The problem of detecting quantum product states is chosen to demonstrate the QGAN because is well known as purely quantum mechanical, has no classical analog and is an open problem for quantum product states of more than 2 qubits. With proper encoding of image pixels into quantum states as density matrices, the method demonstrated here is applicable to GAN image generation and detection that can be hosted on and take advantage of the nature of quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Constructed Scalable Circuits ADAPT-VQE in the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements of simulating periodic systems on quantum computers, we develop a new approach, (SC)$^2$-ADAPT-VQE, to further advance the simulation of these systems. Our approach extends the scalable circuits ADAPT-VQE framework, which builds an ansatz from a pool of coordinate-invariant operators defined for arbitrarily large, though not arbitrarily small, volumes. Our method uses a classically tractable ``Surrogate Constructed'' method to remove irrelevant operators from the pool, reducing the minimum size for which the scalable circuits are defined. Bringing together the scalable circuits and the surrogate constructed approaches forms the core of the (SC)$^2$ methodology. Our approach allows for a wider set of classical computations, on small volumes, which can be used for a more robust extrapolation protocol. While developed in the context of lattice models, the surrogate construction portion is applicable to a wide variety of problems where information about the relative importance of operators in the pool is available. As an example, we use it to compute properties of the Schwinger model - quantum electrodynamics for a single, massive fermion in $1+1$ dimensions - and show that our method can be used to accurately extrapolate to the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Probing topological entanglement on large scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum matter exhibits intriguing long-range patterns of entanglement, which reveal themselves in subsystem entropies. However, measuring such entropies, which can be used to certify topological order, on large partitions is challenging and becomes practically unfeasible for large systems. We propose a protocol based on local adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian which extracts the universal features of long-range topological entanglement from measurements on small subsystems of finite size, trading an exponential number of measurements against a polynomial-time evolution. Our protocol is general and readily applicable to various quantum simulation architectures. We apply our method to various string-net models representing both abelian and non-abelian topologically ordered phases, and illustrate its application to neutral atom tweezer arrays with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Quantum Sample Complexity of Measurement Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies quantum supervised learning for classical inference from quantum states. In this model, a learner has access to a set of labeled quantum samples as the training set. The objective is to find a quantum measurement that predicts the label of the unseen samples. The hardness of learning is measured via sample complexity under a quantum counterpart of the well-known probably approximately correct (PAC). Quantum sample complexity is expected to be higher than classical one, because of the measurement incompatibility and state collapse. Recent efforts showed that the sample complexity of learning a finite quantum concept class $\mathcal{C}$ scales as $O(|\mathcal{C}|)$. This is significantly higher than the classical sample complexity that grows logarithmically with the class size. This work improves the sample complexity bound to $O(V_{\mathcal{C}^*} \log |\mathcal{C}^*|)$, where $\mathcal{C}^*$ is the set of extreme points of the convex closure of $\mathcal{C}$ and $V_{\mathcal{C}^*}$ is the shadow-norm of this set. We show the tightness of our bound for the class of bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norm, scaling as $O(\log |\mathcal{C}^*|)$. Our approach is based on a new quantum empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm equipped with a shadow tomography method.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral control of spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme aimed at achieving spatio-spectral control over spontaneous emission within a four-level atom-light coupling system interacting with optical vortices carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). The atom comprises a ground level and two excited states coupled with two laser fields, forming a V subsystem where the upper states exclusively decay to a common fourth state via two channels. By investigating various initial states of the atom and considering the presence or absence of quantum interference in spontaneous emission channels, we analyze how the characteristics of the OAM-carrying vortex beam imprint onto the emission spectrum. The interplay between the optical vortex and the quantum system, including its environment modes, induces a wide variety of spatio-spectral behaviour, including two-dimensional spectral-peak narrowing, spectralpeak enhancement, spectral-peak suppression, and spontaneous emission reduction or quenching in the spatial azimuthal plane. Our findings shed light on the dynamics of atom-vortex beam light interactions and offer insights into the manipulation of emission properties at the quantum level.</description>

      <title>A General Framework for Gradient-Based Optimization of Superconducting Quantum Circuits using Qubit Discovery as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering the Hamiltonian of a quantum system is fundamental to the design of quantum systems. Automating Hamiltonian design through gradient-based optimization can dramatically accelerate this process. However, computing the gradients of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Hamiltonian--a large, sparse matrix--relative to system properties poses a significant challenge, especially for arbitrary systems. Superconducting quantum circuits offer substantial flexibility in Hamiltonian design, making them an ideal platform for this task. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for the gradient-based optimization of superconducting quantum circuits, leveraging the SQcircuit software package. By addressing the challenge of calculating the gradient of the eigensystem for large, sparse Hamiltonians and integrating automatic differentiation within SQcircuit, our framework enables efficient and precise computation of gradients for various circuit properties or custom-defined metrics, streamlining the optimization process. We apply this framework to the qubit discovery problem, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying qubit designs with superior performance metrics. The optimized circuits show improvements in a heuristic measure of gate count, upper bounds on gate speed, decoherence time, and resilience to noise and fabrication errors compared to existing qubits. While this methodology is showcased through qubit optimization and discovery, it is versatile and can be extended to tackle other optimization challenges in superconducting quantum hardware design.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks are (Effectively) Classically Simulable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) are widely regarded as a promising model for Quantum Machine Learning (QML). In this work we tie their heuristic success to two facts. First, that when randomly initialized, they can only operate on the information encoded in low-bodyness measurements of their input states. And second, that they are commonly benchmarked on "locally-easy'' datasets whose states are precisely classifiable by the information encoded in these low-bodyness observables subspace. We further show that the QCNN's action on this subspace can be efficiently classically simulated by a classical algorithm equipped with Pauli shadows on the dataset. Indeed, we present a shadow-based simulation of QCNNs on up-to $1024$ qubits for phases of matter classification. Our results can then be understood as highlighting a deeper symptom of QML: Models could only be showing heuristic success because they are benchmarked on simple problems, for which their action can be classically simulated. This insight points to the fact that non-trivial datasets are a truly necessary ingredient for moving forward with QML. To finish, we discuss how our results can be extrapolated to classically simulate other architectures.</description>

      <title>Comparing the cost of violating causal assumptions in Bell experiments: locality, free choice and arrow-of-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The causal modelling of Bell experiments relies on three fundamental assumptions: locality, freedom of choice, and arrow-of-time. It turns out that nature violates Bell inequalities, which entails the failure of at least one of those assumptions. Since rejecting any of them - even partially - proves to be enough to explain the observed correlations, it is natural to ask about the cost in each case. This paper follows up on the results in PNAS 118 e2020569118 (2021), showing the equivalence between the locality and free choice assumptions, adding to the picture retro-causal models explaining the observed correlations. Here, we consider more challenging causal scenarios which allow only single-arrow type violations of a given assumption. The figure of merit chosen for the comparison of the causal cost is defined as the minimal frequency of violation of the respective assumption required for a simulation of the observed experimental statistics.</description>

      <title>High-distance codes with transversal Clifford and $T$-gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-local interactions in several quantum devices allow for the realization of more compact quantum encodings while retaining the same degree of protection against noise. Anticipating that short to medium-length codes will soon be realizable, it is important to construct stabilizer codes that, for a given code distance, admit fault-tolerant implementations of logical gates with the fewest number of physical qubits. We extract high-distance doubly even codes from the quantum quadratic-residue code family that admit a transversal implementation of the single-qubit Clifford group. Applying a doubling procedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields a family of high-distance triply even codes which admit a transversal implementation of the logical $\texttt{T}$-gate. To our knowledge, both code families require a lower qubit overhead than any other qubit stabilizer code of the same distance which can realize their respective gates.</description>

      <title>Month-long-lifetime microwave spectral holes in an erbium-doped scheelite crystal at millikelvin temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth-ion (REI) ensembles in crystals have remarkable optical and spin properties characterized by narrow homogeneous linewidths relative to the inhomogeneous ensemble broadening. This makes it possible to precisely tailor the ensemble spectral density and therefore the absorption profile by applying narrow-linewidth radiation to transfer population into auxiliary levels, a process broadly known as spectral hole burning (SHB). REI-doped crystals find applications in information processing, both classical (pattern recognition, filtering, spectral analysis) and quantum (photon storage), all protocols requiring suitable ensemble preparation by SHB as a first step. In Er$^{3+}$-doped materials, the longest reported hole lifetime is one minute, and longer lifetimes are desirable. Here, we report SHB and accumulated echo measurements in a scheelite crystal of CaWO$_4$ by pumping the electron spin transition of Er$^{3+}$ ions at microwave frequencies and millikelvin temperatures, with nuclear spin states of neighboring $^{183}$W atoms serving as the auxiliary levels. The lifetime of the holes and accumulated echoes rises steeply as the sample temperature is decreased, exceeding a month at 10 mK. Our results demonstrate that millikelvin temperatures can be beneficial for signal processing applications requiring long spectral hole lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of quantum Fisher information for large system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fisher information (QFI) plays a vital role in quantum precision measurement, quantum information, many-body physics, and other domains. Obtaining the QFI from experiment for a quantum state reveals insights such as the limits of estimation accuracy for a certain parameter, the degree of entanglement, and the geometric characteristics of the quantum state. Nonetheless, the measurement complexity of the QFI and its lower bound hinges on the dimension of the quantum state. Consequently, reducing the complexity of measurement is a significant challenge. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the QFI of high-dimensional systems by transferring information to an auxiliary system and measuring its sub-QFI, while also offering conditions to diminish the dimension of auxiliary system to be measured without affecting the amount of information obtained by it.</description>

      <title>Towards a Resource-Optimized Dynamic Quantum Algorithm via Non-iterative Auxiliary Subspace Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent quantum algorithms pertaining to electronic structure theory primarily focus on threshold-based dynamic construction of ansatz by selectively including important many-body operators. These methods can be made systematically more accurate by tuning the threshold to include more number of operators into the ansatz. However, such improvements come at the cost of rapid proliferation of the circuit depth, especially for highly correlated molecular systems. In this work, we address this issue by the development of a novel theoretical framework that relies on the segregation of an ansatz into a dynamically selected core principal component, which is, by construction adiabatically decoupled from the remaining operators. This enables us to perform computations involving the principal component using extremely shallow-depth circuits whereas, the effect of the remaining auxiliary component is folded into the energy function via a cost-efficient non-iterative correction, ensuring the requisite accuracy. We propose a formalism that analytically predicts the auxiliary parameters from the principal ones, followed by a suite of non-iterative auxiliary subspace correction techniques with different levels of sophistication. The auxiliary subspace corrections incur no additional quantum resources, yet complement an inadequately expressive core of the ansatz to recover significant amount of electronic correlations. We have numerically validated the resource efficiency and accuracy of our formalism with a number of strongly correlated molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Single-qubit rotations on a binomial code without ancillary qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Great attention has been paid to binomial codes utilizing bosonic systems as logical qubits with error correction capabilities. However, implementing single-qubit rotation operations on binomial codes has proven challenging, requiring an ancillary qubit in previous approaches. Here, we propose a method for performing logical qubit rotation on binomial codes without requiring an ancillary qubit. Specifically, we explain how to implement $X$-axis rotations by simultaneously applying two-frequency parametric drives to resonators with nonlinearity. Furthermore, we show that $Z$-axis rotations could be realized with the detuning. Due to the reduction of the need for the ancillary qubit for the logical qubit rotation, our proposed approach is advantageous for quantum computation in the NISQ era, where the number of qubits is limited.</description>

      <title>Attractive-repulsive interaction in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of quantum self-sustained oscillators induced by the simultaneous presence of attraction and repulsion in the coupling path. We consider quantum Stuart-Landau oscillators under attractive-repulsive coupling and construct the corresponding quantum master equation in the Lindblad form. We discover an interesting symmetry-breaking transition from quantum limit cycle oscillation to quantum inhomogeneous steady state; This transition is contrary to the previously known symmetry-breaking transition from quantum homogeneous to inhomogeneous steady state. The result is supported by the analysis on the noisy classical model of the quantum system in the weak quantum regime. Remarkably, we find the generation of entanglement associated with the symmetry-breaking transition that has no analogue in the classical domain. This study will enrich our understanding of the collective behaviors shown by coupled oscillators in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>High-dimentional Multipartite Entanglement Structure Detection with Low Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement detection and characterization are crucial for various quantum information processes. Most existing methods for entanglement detection rely heavily on a complete description of the quantum state, which requires numerous measurements and complex setups. This makes these theoretically sound approaches costly and impractical, as the system size increases. In this work, we propose a multi-view neural network model to generate representations suitable for entanglement structure detection. The number of required quantum measurements is polynomial rather than exponential increase with the qubit number. This remarkable reduction in resource costs makes it possible to detect specific entanglement structures in large-scale systems. Numerical simulations show that our method achieves over 95% detection accuracy for up to 19 qubits systems. By enabling a universal, flexible and resource-efficient analysis of entanglement structures, our approach enhances the capability of utilizing quantum states across a wide range of applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics, in its orthodox version, imposes severe limits on what can be known, or even said, about the condition of a quantum system between two observations. A relatively new approach, based on so-called "weak measurements", suggests that such forbidden knowledge can be gained by studying the system's response to an inaccurate weakly perturbing measuring device. It goes further to propose revising the whole concept of physics variables, and offers various examples of counterintuitive quantum behaviour. Both views go to the very heart of quantum theory, and yet are rarely compared directly. A new technique must either transcend the orthodox limits, or just prove that these limits are indeed necessary. We study both possibilities, and find for the orthodoxy.</description>

      <title>Emergence of global receptive fields capturing multipartite quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent non-locality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. Particularly, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) within the neural quantum tomography of the highly-entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of the N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with non-local patterns and pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gaussian quantum metrology with position-momentum correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology offers significant improvements in several quantum technologies. In this work, we propose a Gaussian quantum metrology protocol assisted by initial position-momentum correlations (PM). We employ a correlated Gaussian wave packet as a probe to examine the dynamics of Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and purity based on PM correlations to demonstrate how to estimate the PM correlations and, more importantly, to unlock its potential applications such as a resource to enhance quantum thermometry. In the low-temperature regime, we find an improvement in the thermometry of the surrounding environment when the original system exhibits a non-null initial correlation (correlated Gaussian state). In addition, we explore the connection between the loss of purity and the gain in QFI during the process of estimating the effective environment coupling and its effective temperature.</description>

Abstract: Quantum money is the first invention in quantum information science, promising advantages over classical money by simultaneously achieving unforgeability, user privacy, and instant validation. However, standard quantum money relies on quantum memories and long-distance quantum communication, which are technologically extremely challenging. Quantum "S-money" tokens eliminate these technological requirements while preserving unforgeability, user privacy, and instant validation. Here, we report the first full experimental demonstration of quantum S-tokens, proven secure despite errors, losses and experimental imperfections. The heralded single-photon source with a high system efficiency of 88.24% protects against arbitrary multi-photon attacks arising from losses in the quantum token generation. Following short-range quantum communication, the token is stored, transacted, and verified using classical bits. We demonstrate a transaction time advantage over intra-city 2.77 km and inter-city 60.54 km optical fibre networks, compared with optimal classical cross-checking schemes. Our implementation demonstrates the practicality of quantum S-tokens for applications requiring high security, privacy and minimal transaction times, like financial trading and network control. It is also the first demonstration of a quantitative quantum time advantage in relativistic cryptography, showing the enhanced cryptographic power of simultaneously considering quantum and relativistic physics.</description>

      <title>Empirical Power of Quantum Encoding Methods for Binary Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is one of the many potential applications of quantum computing, each of which is hoped to provide some novel computational advantage. However, quantum machine learning applications often fail to outperform classical approaches on real-world classical data. The ability of these models to generalize well from few training data points is typically considered one of the few definitive advantages of this approach. In this work, we will instead focus on encoding schemes and their effects on various machine learning metrics. Specifically, we focus on real-world data encoding to demonstrate differences between quantum encoding strategies for several real-world datasets and the classification model standard, LightGBM. In particular, we apply the following encoding strategies, including three standard approaches and two modified approaches: Angle, Amplitude, IQP, Entangled Angle, and Alternative IQP. As these approaches require either a significant number of qubits or gates to encode larger datasets, we perform feature selection to support the limited computing power of quantum simulators. This feature selection is performed through a quantum annealing enhanced approach that builds on a QUBO formulation of the problem. In this work, we provide a preliminary demonstration that quantum machine learning with the IQP encoding and LightGBM produce statistically equivalent results for a large majority of the assigned learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rainbow Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce rainbow codes, a novel class of quantum error correcting codes generalising colour codes and pin codes. Rainbow codes can be defined on any $D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D+1)$-colouring of its $0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are derived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by reinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain walls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number of encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by transversal application of $T$ and $T^\dag$. By combining these techniques with the quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain families of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters $[\![n,O(n),O(log(n))]\!]$ which allow the magic-state yield parameter $\gamma = \log_d(n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to other recent constructions that achieve $\gamma \rightarrow 0$ our codes are natively defined on qubits, are LDPC, and have logical non-Clifford gates implementable by single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not asymptotically good.</description>

      <title>Motion-driven quantum dissipation in an open electronic system with nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates with relative motion. We model the degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field and select a nonlocal potential to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, assuming one plate slides relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. The numerical plots show that, as a function of momentum the vacuum occupation number is isotropic for a motion speed v = 0 and anisotropic for nonzero v. Due to energy transfer between the plates, the process of relative motion induces on-shell excitations, similar to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Therefore, we can study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces via quantum action. The numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action for the motion boost and the dissipative force have a threshold as a function of v, and both are positively correlated with v.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave matched filtering with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of variational quantum algorithms designed for classical optimization to the problem of matched filtering in the detection of gravitational waves. Matched filtering for detecting gravitational wave signals requires searching through a large number of template waveforms, to find one which is highly correlated with segments of detector data. This computationally intensive task needs to be done quickly for low latency searches in order to aid with follow-up multi-messenger observations. The variational quantum algorithms we study for this task consist of quantum walk-based generalizations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We present results of classical numerical simulations of these quantum algorithms using open science data from LIGO. These results show that the tested variational quantum algorithms are outperformed by an unstructured restricted-depth Grover search algorithm, suggesting that the latter is optimal for this computational task.</description>

      <title>Improved Recursive QAOA for Solving MAX-CUT on Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm proposed with the goal of approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems such as the MAX-CUT problem. It has been considered a potential candidate for achieving quantum advantage in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and has been extensively studied. However, the performance limitations of low-level QAOA have also been demonstrated across various instances. In this work, we first analytically prove the performance limitations of level-1 QAOA in solving the MAX-CUT problem on bipartite graphs. We derive an upper bound for the approximation ratio based on the average degree of bipartite graphs. Second, we show through numerical results that solving the same problem using level-1 Recursive QAOA (RQAOA), which is one of the variants of QAOA that uses QAOA as a subroutine to reduce the graph size recursively, outperforms the original QAOA but still exhibits limitations as the graph size increases. To address these limitations, we propose a modified RQAOA that reduces the parameter regime optimized in the QAOA subroutine. While reducing the optimization space could generally make it more challenging to find the true optimal parameters, interestingly, we prove that this modified RQAOA can find the exact maximum cut for a parity partitioned graph which includes all weighted bipartite graphs.</description>

Abstract: The process of translating a quantum algorithm into a form suitable for implementation on a quantum computing platform is crucial but yet challenging. This entails specifying quantum operations with precision, a typically intricate task. In this paper, we present an alternative approach: an automated method for synthesizing the functionality of a quantum algorithm into a quantum circuit model representation. Our methodology involves training a neural network model using diverse input-output mappings of the quantum algorithm. We demonstrate that this trained model can effectively generate a quantum circuit model equivalent to the original algorithm. Remarkably, our observations indicate that the trained model achieves near-perfect mapping of unseen inputs to their respective outputs.</description>

      <title>Fullerene-encapsulated Cyclic Ozone for the Next Generation of Nano-sized Propellants via Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic ozone additives have the potential to significantly increase the specific impulse of rocket fuel, which would lead to greater efficiency and reduced costs for space launches, allowing up to one third more payload per rocket. Although practical attempts to capture this isomer have not been successful, cyclic ozone might be stabilized within confined geometries. However, the required synthetic methods are challenging to design and need theory-driven inputs that exceed the capabilities of classical methods. Quantum computation could enable these calculations, but the hardware requirements for many practical applications are still unclear. We provide a comprehensive analysis of how quantum methods could aid efforts to isolate cyclic ozone using fullerene encapsulation. Our discussion goes beyond formal complexity analysis, offering both logical and physical overhead estimates for determining ground state energies based on quantum phase estimation (QPE). Together, these data outline a plausible scale for realistic, computationally-assisted molecular design efforts using fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use an ensemble of laser-cooled strontium atoms in a high-finesse cavity to cleanly emulate the technique of rf spectroscopy employed in studies of BEC-BCS physics in fermionic superfluids of degenerate cold gases. Here, we leverage the multilevel internal structure of the atoms to study the physics of Cooper pair breaking in this system. In doing so, we observe and distinguish the properties of two distinct many-body gaps, the BCS pairing gap and the spectral gap, using nondestructive readout techniques. The latter is found to depend on the populations of the internal atomic states, reflecting the chemical potential dependence predicted in fermionic superfluids. This work opens the path for more fully exploiting the rich internal structure of atoms in cavity QED emulators to study both analogous systems and also more exotic states yet to be realized.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Time-Ordered-Correlators for the Pure Inverted Quartic Oscillator: Classical Chaos meets Quantum Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs) have been suggested as a means to diagnose chaotic behavior in quantum mechanical systems. Recently, it was found that OTOCs display exponential growth for the inverted quantum harmonic oscillator, mirroring the fact that this system is classically and quantum mechanically unstable. In this work, I study OTOCs for the inverted anharmonic (pure quartic) oscillator in quantum mechanics, finding only oscillatory behavior despite the classically unstable nature of the system. For higher temperature, OTOCs seem to exhibit saturation consistent with a value of $-2 \langle x^2 \rangle_T \langle p^2 \rangle_T$ at late times. I provide analytic evidence from the spectral zeta-function and the WKB method as well as direct numerical solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation that the inverted quartic oscillator possesses a real and positive energy eigenspectrum, and normalizable wave-functions.</description>

Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Quantum pathways interference in laser-induced electron diffraction revealed by a semiclassical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for strong-laser-field physics based on the combination of the semiclassical Herman-Kluk propagator and the strong-field approximation and demonstrate its high accuracy on the calculations of photoelectron momentum distribution (PMD) for atoms and molecules in intense lasers. For rescattered electrons, we show that for a given time that electron tunnels to the continuum, there are typically multiple trajectories that lead to the same final momentum in the high-energy region. These trajectories start with slightly different initial transverse momenta and carry different phases giving rise to the interference structures in the PMD, which can also be associated with the laser-free electron-ion differential cross section. This is in contrast to the well-known long and short trajectories, which result in different interference patterns. Our results can be used to extend current capabilities of the laser-induced electron diffraction and other ultrafast imaging and strong-field spectroscopic techniques.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved sensing of electromagnetic fields with single-electron interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing quantum states of the electromagnetic field at microwave frequencies requires fast and sensitive detectors that can simultaneously probe the field time-dependent amplitude and its quantum fluctuations. In this work, we demonstrate a quantum sensor that exploits the phase of a single electron wavefunction, measured in an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer, to detect a classical time-dependent electric field. The time resolution, limited by the temporal width of the electronic wavepacket, is a few tens of picoseconds. The interferometry technique provides a voltage resolution of a few tens of microvolts, corresponding to a few microwave photons. Importantly, our detector simultaneously probes the amplitude of the field from the phase of the measured interference pattern and its fluctuations from the interference contrast. This capability paves the way for on-chip detection of quantum radiation, such as squeezed or Fock states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of polar systems coupled to classical external beams in the ultrastrong coupling regime. The permanent dipole moments (PDMs) sustained by polar systems can couple to the electromagnetic field, giving rise to a variety of processes such as difference-frequency and harmonic generation, reflected in complicated dynamics of the atomic system. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics can be described simply in a dynamic reference frame. We derive a Jaynes-Cummings-like framework with effective parameters describing frequency shift, coupling strength with the driving field, and a rescaled relaxation rate. The familiar linear scaling of the interaction strength with the field amplitude is replaced with a nonlinear dependence, suggesting potential applications for improving the coherence of quantum system ensembles with permanent dipoles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic flying qubits offer an interesting alternative to photonic qubits: electrons propagate slower, hence easier to control in real time, and Coulomb interaction enables direct entanglement between different qubits. While their coherence time is limited, picosecond-scale control would make them competitive in terms of number of possible coherent operations. The key challenge lies in achieving the dynamical regime, where the injected plasmonic pulse width is shorter than the quantum device dimensions. Here we reach this new regime in a quantum nanoelectronic system by injecting ultrashort single electron plasmonic pulses into a 14-micrometer-long Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Our findings reveal that quantum coherence is preserved for ultrashort plasmonic pulses, exhibiting enhanced contrast of coherent oscillations compared to the DC regime. Moreover, this coherence remains robust even under large bias voltages. This milestone demonstrates the feasibility of flying qubits as a promising alternative to localized qubit architectures, offering reduced hardware footprint, increased connectivity, and potential for scalable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Eliminating Surface Oxides of Superconducting Circuits with Noble Metal Encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lifetime of superconducting qubits is limited by dielectric loss, and a major source of dielectric loss is the native oxide present at the surface of the superconducting metal. Specifically, tantalum-based superconducting qubits have been demonstrated with record lifetimes, but a major source of loss is the presence of two-level systems (TLSs) in the surface tantalum oxide. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for avoiding oxide formation by encapsulating the tantalum with noble metals that do not form native oxide. By depositing a few nanometers of Au or AuPd alloy before breaking vacuum, we completely suppress tantalum oxide formation. Microwave loss measurements of superconducting resonators reveal that the noble metal is proximitized, with a superconducting gap over 80% of the bare tantalum at thicknesses where the oxide is fully suppressed. We find that losses in resonators fabricated by subtractive etching are dominated by oxides on the sidewalls, suggesting total surface encapsulation by additive fabrication as a promising strategy for eliminating surface oxide TLS loss in superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider how to target evolution conditioned on atypical measurement outcomes in monitored quantum circuits, i.e., the post-selection problem. We show that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone dynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged correlations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement outcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive conditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork quantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a model system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical transition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general dynamical correlations.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z&lt;1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>Third quantization with Hartree approximation for open-system bosonic transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third quantization (3rd Q) for bosons provides the exact steady-state solution of the Lindblad equation with quadratic Hamiltonians. By decomposing the interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree approximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the open-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady state. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite Fock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the system size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM, including the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations with capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree approximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of the steady-state value. Thus, the manageable 3rd Q with Hartree approximation allows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum transport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum resonances in collisions and reactions are a sensitive probe of the intermolecular forces. They may dominate the final quantum state distribution, as recently observed for Feshbach resonances in a cold collision experiment (Science 380, 77 (2023)). This raises the question whether the sensitivity of such measurements is sufficient to assess the quality of theoretical models for the interaction. We here compare measured collision cross sections to those obtained with exact quantum coupled-channels scattering calculations for three different ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find that the ability to test the correct prediction of energy redistribution over molecular degrees of freedom is within reach, requiring only a modest improvement in energy resolution of current experiments. Such improvement will enable the separation of individual resonances and allow for an unambiguous experimental test of different theory approaches.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight dark photons constitute a well-motivated candidate for dark matter. A coherent electromagnetic wave is expected to be induced by dark photons when coupled with Standard-Model photons through kinetic mixing mechanism, and should be spatially correlated within the de Broglie wavelength of dark photons. Here we report the first search for correlated dark-photon signals using a long-baseline network of 15 atomic magnetometers, which are situated in two separated meter-scale shield rooms with a distance of about 1700 km. Both the network's multiple sensors and the shields large size significantly enhance the expected dark-photon electromagnetic signals, and long-baseline measurements confidently reduce many local noise sources. Using this network, we constrain the kinetic mixing coefficient of dark photon dark matter over the mass range 4.1 feV-2.1 peV, which represents the most stringent constraints derived from any terrestrial experiments operating over the aforementioned mass range. Our prospect indicates that future data releases may go beyond the astrophysical constraints from the cosmic microwave background and the plasma heating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most quantum theorists are familiar with different ways of describing the effective quantum dynamics of a system coupled to external degrees of freedom, such as the Born-Markov master equation or the adiabatic elimination. Understanding the deep connection between these -- sometimes apparently unrelated -- methods can be a powerful tool, allowing us to derive effective dynamics in unconventional systems or regimes. This tutorial aims at providing quantum theorists across multiple fields (e.g., quantum and atom optics, optomechanics, or hybrid quantum systems) with a self-contained practical toolbox to derive effective quantum dynamics, applicable to systems ranging from $N-$level emitters to mechanical resonators. First, we summarize the projector approach to open quantum systems and the derivation of the fundamental Nakajima-Zwanzig equation. Then, we show how three common effective equations, namely the Brownian master equation, the Born-Markov master equation, and the adiabatic elimination used in atom and molecular optics, can be derived from different perturbative expansions of the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation. We also solve in detail four specific examples using this formalism, namely a harmonic oscillator subject to displacement noise, the effective equations of a mechanical resonator cooled by an optical cavity, the Purcell effect for a qubit coupled to an optical cavity, and the adiabatic elimination in a Lambda system.</description>

Abstract: With the increased availability of quantum technological devices, it becomes more important to have tools to guarantee their correct nonclassical behavior. This is especially important for quantum networks, which constitute the platforms where multipartite cryptographic protocols will be implemented, and where guarantees of nonclassicality translate into security proofs. We derive linear and nonlinear Bell-like inequalities for networks, whose violation certifies the absence of a minimum number of classical sources in them. We do so, first, without assuming that nature is ultimately governed by quantum mechanics, providing a hierarchy interpolating between network nonlocality and full network nonlocality. Second we insert this assumption, which leads to results more amenable to certification in experiments.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the extent to which two particles can be maximally entangled when they are also similarly entangled with other particles on a complete graph, focusing on Werner, isotropic, and Brauer states. To address this, we formulate and solve optimization problems that draw on concepts from many-body physics, computational complexity, and quantum cryptography. We approach the problem by formalizing it as a semi-definite program (SDP), which we solve analytically using tools from representation theory. Notably, we determine the exact maximum values for the projection onto the maximally entangled state and the antisymmetric Werner state, thereby resolving long-standing open problems in the field of quantum extendibility. Our results are achieved by leveraging SDP duality, the representation theory of symmetric, unitary and orthogonal groups, and the Brauer algebra.</description>

Abstract: Gradient-based optimizers have been proposed for training variational quantum circuits in settings such as quantum neural networks (QNNs). The task of gradient estimation, however, has proven to be challenging, primarily due to distinctive quantum features such as state collapse and measurement incompatibility. Conventional techniques, such as the parameter-shift rule, necessitate several fresh samples in each iteration to estimate the gradient due to the stochastic nature of state measurement. Owing to state collapse from measurement, the inability to reuse samples in subsequent iterations motivates a crucial inquiry into whether fundamentally more efficient approaches to sample utilization exist. In this paper, we affirm the feasibility of such efficiency enhancements through a novel procedure called quantum shadow gradient descent (QSGD), which uses a single sample per iteration to estimate all components of the gradient. Our approach is based on an adaptation of shadow tomography that significantly enhances sample efficiency. Through detailed theoretical analysis, we show that QSGD has a significantly faster convergence rate than existing methods under locality conditions. We present detailed numerical experiments supporting all of our theoretical claims.</description>

      <title>On the connection between least squares, regularization, and classical shadows</title>

Abstract: Classical shadows (CS) offer a resource-efficient means to estimate quantum observables, circumventing the need for exhaustive state tomography. Here, we clarify and explore the connection between CS techniques and least squares (LS) and regularized least squares (RLS) methods commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. By formal identification of LS and RLS "shadows" completely analogous to those in CS -- namely, point estimators calculated from the empirical frequencies of single measurements -- we show that both RLS and CS can be viewed as regularizers for the underdetermined regime, replacing the pseudoinverse with invertible alternatives. Through numerical simulations, we evaluate RLS and CS from three distinct angles: the tradeoff in bias and variance, mismatch between the expected and actual measurement distributions, and the interplay between the number of measurements and number of shots per measurement. Compared to CS, RLS attains lower variance at the expense of bias, is robust to distribution mismatch, and is more sensitive to the number of shots for a fixed number of state copies -- differences that can be understood from the distinct approaches taken to regularization. Conceptually, our integration of LS, RLS, and CS under a unifying "shadow" umbrella aids in advancing the overall picture of CS techniques, while practically our results highlight the tradeoffs intrinsic to these measurement approaches, illuminating the circumstances under which either RLS or CS would be preferred, such as unverified randomness for the former or unbiased estimation for the latter.</description>

      <title>Entanglement buffering with two quantum memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks crucially rely on the availability of high-quality entangled pairs of qubits, known as entangled links, distributed across distant nodes. Maintaining the quality of these links is a challenging task due to the presence of time-dependent noise, also known as decoherence. Entanglement purification protocols offer a solution by converting multiple low-quality entangled states into a smaller number of higher-quality ones. In this work, we introduce a framework to analyse the performance of entanglement buffering setups that combine entanglement consumption, decoherence, and entanglement purification. We propose two key metrics: the availability, which is the steady-state probability that an entangled link is present, and the average consumed fidelity, which quantifies the steady-state quality of consumed links. We then investigate a two-node system, where each node possesses two quantum memories: one for long-term entanglement storage, and another for entanglement generation. We model this setup as a continuous-time stochastic process and derive analytical expressions for the performance metrics. Our findings unveil a trade-off between the availability and the average consumed fidelity. We also bound these performance metrics for a buffering system that employs the well-known bilocal Clifford purification protocols. Importantly, our analysis demonstrates that, in the presence of noise, consistently purifying the buffered entanglement increases the average consumed fidelity, even when some buffered entanglement is discarded due to purification failures.</description>

Abstract: A source assumed to prepare a specified reference state sometimes prepares an anomalous one. We address the task of identifying these anomalous states in a series of $n$ preparations with $k$ anomalies. We analyze the minimum-error protocol and the zero-error (unambiguous) protocol and obtain closed expressions for the success probability when both reference and anomalous states are known to the observer and anomalies can appear equally likely in any position of the preparation series. We find the solution using results from association schemes theory, thus establishing a connection between graph theory and quantum hypothesis testing. In particular, we use the Johnson association scheme which arises naturally from the Gram matrix of this problem. We also study the regime of large $n$ and obtain the expression of the success probability that is non-vanishing. Finally, we address the case in which the observer is blind to the reference and the anomalous states. This scenario requires a universal protocol for which we prove that in the asymptotic limit, the success probability corresponds to the average of the known state scenario.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling between a single photon and a photon pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of strong nonlinear coupling between single photons has been a long-standing goal in quantum optics and quantum information science, promising wide impact applications, such as all-optical deterministic quantum logic and single-photon frequency conversion. Here, we report an experimental observation of the strong coupling between a single photon and a photon pair in an ultrastrongly-coupled circuit-QED system. This strong nonlinear interaction is realized by introducing a detuned flux qubit working as an effective coupler between two modes of a superconducting coplanar waveguide resonator. The ultrastrong light--matter interaction breaks the excitation number conservation, and an external flux bias breaks the parity conservation. The combined effect of the two enables the strong one--two-photon coupling. Quantum Rabi-like avoided crossing is resolved when tuning the two-photon resonance frequency of the first mode across the single-photon resonance frequency of the second mode. Within this new photonic regime, we observe the second harmonic generation for a mean photon number below one. Our results represent a key step towards a new regime of quantum nonlinear optics, where individual photons can deterministically and coherently interact with each other in the absence of any stimulating fields.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup for an Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simon's problem is to find a hidden period (a bitstring) encoded into an unknown $2$-to-$1$ function. It is one of the earliest problems for which an exponential quantum speedup was proven for ideal, noiseless quantum computers, albeit in the oracle model. Here, using two different $127$-qubit IBM Quantum superconducting processors, we demonstrate an algorithmic quantum speedup for a variant of Simon's problem where the hidden period has a restricted Hamming weight $w$. For sufficiently small values of $w$ and for circuits involving up to $58$ qubits, we demonstrate an exponential speedup, albeit of a lower quality than the speedup predicted for the noiseless algorithm. The speedup exponent and the range of $w$ values for which an exponential speedup exists are significantly enhanced when the computation is protected by dynamical decoupling. Further enhancement is achieved with measurement error mitigation. This constitutes a demonstration of a bona fide quantum advantage for an Abelian hidden subgroup problem.</description>

Abstract: Entropy production is the crucial quantity characterizing irreversible phenomena and the second law of thermodynamics. Yet, a ubiquitous definition eludes consensus. Given that entropy production arises from incomplete access to information, in this Letter we use Jaynes' maximum entropy principle to establish a framework that brings together prominent and apparently conflicting definitions. More generally our definition of entropy production addresses any tomographically incomplete quantum measurement and/or the action of a quantum channel on a system.</description>

      <title>Continuously Distributing Entanglement in Quantum Networks with Regular Topologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small interconnected quantum processors can collaborate to tackle quantum computational problems that typically demand more capable devices. These linked processors, referred to as quantum nodes, can use shared entangled states to execute nonlocal operations. As a consequence, understanding how to distribute entangled states among nodes is essential for developing hardware and software. We analyze a protocol where entanglement is continuously distributed among nodes that are physically arranged in a regular pattern: a chain, a honeycomb lattice, a square grid, and a triangular lattice. These regular patterns allow for the modular expansion of networks for large-scale distributed quantum computing. Within the distribution protocol, we investigate how nodes can optimize the frequency of attempting entanglement swaps, trading off multiple entangled states shared with neighboring nodes for fewer states shared with non-neighboring nodes. We evaluate the protocol's performance using the virtual neighborhood size -- a metric indicating the number of other nodes with which a given node shares entangled states. Employing numerical methods, we find that nodes must perform more swaps to maximize the virtual neighborhood size when coherence times are short. In a chain network, the virtual neighborhood size's dependence on swap attempt frequency differs for each node based on its distance from the end of the chain. Conversely, all nodes in the square grid exhibit a qualitatively similar dependence of the virtual neighborhood size on the swap frequency.</description>

Abstract: GraphiQ is a versatile open-source framework for designing photonic graph state generation schemes, with a particular emphasis on photon-emitter hybrid circuits. Built in Python, GraphiQ consists of a suite of design tools, including multiple simulation backends and optimization methods. The library supports scheme optimization in the presence of circuit imperfections, as well as user-defined optimization goals. Our framework thus represents a valuable tool for the development of practical schemes adhering to experimentally-relevant constraints. As graph states are a key resource for measurement-based quantum computing, all-photonic quantum repeaters, and robust quantum metrology, among others, we envision GraphiQ's broad impact for advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14412v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clock interferometry refers to the coherent splitting of a clock into two different paths and recombining in a way that reveals the proper time difference between them. Unlike the comparison of two separate clocks, this approach allows testing how non-flat spacetime influences quantum coherence. Atomic clocks are currently the most accurate time keeping devices. Here we propose using optical tweezers to implement clock interferometry. Our proposed clock interferometer employs an alkaline-earth-like atom held in an optical trap at the magic wavelength. Through a combination of adiabatic, tweezer-based, splitting and recombining schemes and a modified Ramsey sequence on the clock states, we achieve a linear sensitivity to the gravitational time dilation. Moreover, the measurement of the time dilation is insensitive to relative fluctuations in the intensity of the tweezer beams. We analyze the tweezer clock interferometer and show that it is feasible with current technological capabilities. The proposed interferometer could test the effect of gravitational redshift on quantum coherence, and implement the quantum twin paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Passive error correction protects logical information forever (in the thermodynamic limit) by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that certain families of constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no thermodynamic phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit ergodicity-breaking dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. Slow Gibbs sampling of such codes enables fault-tolerant passive quantum error correction using finite-depth circuits. This strategy is well suited to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile platform towards scalable quantum computation and optimization. In this paper we present first demonstrations of weighted graph optimization on a Rydberg atom array using annealing with local light-shifts. We verify the ability to prepare weighted graphs in 1D and 2D arrays, including embedding a five vertex non-unit disk graph using nine physical qubits and demonstration of a simple crossing gadget. We find common annealing ramps leading to preparation of the target ground state robustly over a substantial range of different graph weightings. This work provides a route to exploring large-scale optimization of non-planar weighted graphs relevant for solving relevant real-world problems.</description>

Abstract: Bayesian approach for quantum parameter estimation has gained a renewed interest from practical applications of quantum estimation theory. Recently, a lower bound, called the Bayesian Nagaoka-Hayashi bound for the Bayes risk in quantum domain was proposed, which is an extension of a new approach to point estimation of quantum states by Conlon et al. (2021). The objective of this paper is to explore this Bayesian Nagaoka-Hayashi bound further by obtaining its lower bounds. We first obtain one-parameter family of lower bounds, which is an analogue of the Holevo bound in point estimation. Thereby, we derive one-parameter family of Bayesian logarithmic derivative type lower bounds in a closed form for the parameter independent weight matrix setting. This new bound includes previously known Bayesian lower bounds as special cases.</description>

      <title>Local and nonlocal stochastic control of quantum chaos: Measurement- and control-induced criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the topology of the phase diagram of a family of quantum models inspired by the classical Bernoulli map under stochastic control. The quantum models inherit a control-induced phase transition from the classical model and also manifest an entanglement phase transition intrinsic to the quantum setting. This measurement-induced phase transition has been shown in various settings to either coincide or split off from the control transition, but a systematic understanding of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the two transitions to coincide in this case has so far been lacking. In this work, we generalize the control map to allow for either local or global control action. While this does not affect the classical aspects of the control transition that is described by a random walk, it significantly influences the quantum dynamics, leading to the universality class of the measurement-induced transition being dependent on the locality of the control operation. In the presence of a global control map, the two transitions coincide and the control-induced phase transition dominates the measurement-induced phase transition. Contrarily, the two transitions split in the presence of the local control map or additional projective measurements and generically take on distinct universality classes. For local control, the measurement-induced phase transition recovers the Haar logarithmic conformal field theory universality class found in feedback-free models. However, for global control, a novel universality class with correlation length exponent $\nu \approx 0.7$ emerges from the interplay of control and projective measurements. This work provides a more refined understanding of the relationship between the control- and measurement-induced phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We show that quantum entanglement states are associated with multilinear polynomials that cannot be factored. By using these multilinear polynomials, we propose a geometric representation for entanglement states. In particular, we show that the Bell's states are associated with non-factorable real multilinear polynomial, which can be represented geometrically by three-dimensional surfaces. Furthermore, in this framework, we show that a quantum circuit can be seen as a geometric transformations of plane geometry. This phenomenon is analogous to gravity, where matter curves space-time. In addition, we show an analogy between quantum teleportation and operations involving multilinear polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we describe certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, both of which are exactly-solvable models in quantum mechanics. By coupling the dynamics of a particle moving in a one-dimensional potential to an imaginary-valued gauge field, it is possible to obtain certain pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the original (Hermitian) problem. In particular, it is pointed out that the Swanson oscillator arises as such an extension of the quantum harmonic oscillator. For the pseudo-Hermitian extensions of the harmonic and isotonic oscillators, we explicitly solve for the wavefunctions in the position representation and also explore their intertwining relations.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Magic Resources</title>

Abstract: Magic states and magic gates are crucial for achieving universal computation, but some important questions about how magic resources should be implemented to attain quantum advantage have remained unexplored, for instance, in the context of Measurement-based Quantum Computation (MQC) with only single-qubit measurements. This work bridges the gap between MQC and the resource theory of magic by introducing the concept of ``invested'' and ``potential" magic resources. The former quantifies the magic cost associated with the MQC framework, serving both as a witness of magic resources and an upper bound for the realization of a desired unitary transformation. Potential magic resources represent the maximum achievable magic resource in a given graph structure defining the MQC. We utilize these concepts to analyze the magic resource requirements of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and provide a fresh perspective on the universality of MQC of different resource states, highlighting the crucial role of non-Pauli measurements for injecting magic. We demonstrate experimentally our theoretical predictions in a high-fidelity four-photon setup and demonstrate the efficiency of MQC in generating magic states, surpassing the limitations of conventional magic state injection methods. Our findings pave the way for future research exploring magic resource optimization and novel distillation schemes within the MQC framework, contributing to the advancement of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrological capability as a probe for quantum phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The comprehension of quantum phase transitions (QPTs) is considered as a critical foothold in the field of many-body physics. Developing protocols to effectively identify and understand QPTs thus represents a key but challenging task for present quantum simulation experiments. Here, we establish a dynamical quench-interferometric framework to probe a zero-temperature QPT, which utilizes the evolved state by quenching the QPT Hamiltonian as input of a unitary interferometer. The metrological capability quantified by the quantum Fisher information captivatingly shows an unique peak in the vicinity of the quantum critical point, allowing us to probe the QPT without cooling the system to its ground state. We show that the probing can be implemented by extracting quantum fluctuations of the interferometric generator as well as parameter estimation uncertainty of the interferometric phase, and subsequently allows identifying the boundary of the phase diagram. Our results establish an important link between QPTs and quantum metrology, and enrich the toolbox of studying non-equilibrium many-body physics in current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and robust light-matter interactions based on the non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice models featuring the non-Hermitian skin effect have attracted rapidly growing interest due to the nontrivial topology associated with their complex energy spectra. Such non-Hermitian lattices are promising paradigms for engineering exotic light-matter interactions which benefit from the intrinsic chirality and unconventional (non-Bloch) band theory. Here we study a series of unconventional light-matter interactions between quantum emitters and the prototypical Hatano--Nelson model as well as an extended lattice model dubbed the bosonic Kitaev chain. We focus on the robustness of the dynamics to various imperfections and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We consider both small emitters, which interact with the lattice at single sites, and giant emitters coupling at multiple sites. The latter exhibit an exclusive amplification mechanism, which we find enables decoherence-free dynamics even in the presence of extra dissipation in the system. The protection from dissipation arises from a cooperation of the non-Hermiticity and the self-interference effect, and is therefore lacking for small emitters. These results not only provides a deeper insight into the interplay of non-Hermiticity and various interference effects, but also have potential applications in engineering exotic spin Hamiltonians and quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elegant Bell inequality is well known for its much exploited property, being maximally violated by maximal entanglement, mutually unbiased bases, and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure elements. It is the only one with such property known so far. We present a method to construct Bell inequalities with violation feature analogous to original elegant Bell inequality in high dimension from a simple analytic quantum bound. A Bell inequality with such feature is derived in three dimension for the first time. It shows larger violation than existing Bell inequalities of similar classes while requiring arguably small number of measurements.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound on Locally Extractable Energy from Entangled Pure State under Feedback Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an effective thermodynamics for multipartite entangled pure states and derive an upper bound on extractable energy with feedback control from a subsystem under a local Hamiltonian. The inequality that gives the upper bound corresponds to the second law of information thermodynamics in our effective thermodynamics. In addition, we derive a more general bound that is determined only by an initial state and the local Hamiltonian. This bound gives an explicit relationship between the extractable energy and the entanglement structure of the initial state. We also investigate the tightness of the upper bounds and show that the bounds can be achieved in a simple example.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Genotype-Phenotype Maps Reveal Mutational Robustness of RNA Folding, Spin Glasses, and Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of genotype-phenotype (GP) maps have reported universally enhanced phenotypic robustness to genotype mutations, a feature essential to evolution. Virtually all of these studies make a simplifying assumption that each genotype -- represented as a sequence -- maps deterministically to a single phenotype, such as a discrete structure. Here, we introduce probabilistic genotype-phenotype (PrGP) maps, where each genotype maps to a vector of phenotype probabilities, as a more realistic and universal language for investigating robustness in a variety of physical, biological, and computational systems. We study three model systems to show that PrGP maps offer a generalized framework which can handle uncertainty emerging from various physical sources: (1) thermal fluctuation in RNA folding, (2) external field disorder in spin glass ground state finding, and (3) superposition and entanglement in quantum circuits, which are realized experimentally on IBM quantum computers. In all three cases, we observe a novel biphasic robustness scaling which is enhanced relative to random expectation for more frequent phenotypes and approaches random expectation for less frequent phenotypes. We derive an analytical theory for the behavior of PrGP robustness, and we demonstrate that the theory is highly predictive of empirical robustness.</description>

      <title>The $\hbar\to 0$ limit of open quantum systems with general Lindbladians: vanishing noise ensures classicality beyond the Ehrenfest time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum and classical systems evolving under the same formal Hamiltonian $H$ may exhibit dramatically different behavior after the Ehrenfest timescale $t_E \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even as $\hbar \to 0$. Coupling the system to a Markovian environment results in a Lindblad equation for the quantum evolution. Its classical counterpart is given by the Fokker-Planck equation on phase space, which describes Hamiltonian flow with friction and diffusive noise. The quantum and classical evolutions may be compared via the Wigner-Weyl representation. Due to decoherence, they are conjectured to match closely for times far beyond the Ehrenfest timescale as $\hbar \to 0$. We prove a version of this correspondence, bounding the error between the quantum and classical evolutions for any sufficiently regular Hamiltonian $H(x,p)$ and Lindblad functions $L_k(x,p)$. The error is small when the strength of the diffusion $D$ associated to the Lindblad functions satisfies $D \gg \hbar^{4/3}$, in particular allowing vanishing noise in the classical limit. We use a time-dependent semiclassical mixture of variably squeezed Gaussian states evolving by a local harmonic approximation to the Lindblad dynamics. Both the exact quantum trajectory and its classical counterpart can be expressed as perturbations of this semiclassical mixture, with the errors bounded using Duhamel's principle. We present heuristic arguments suggesting the $4/3$ exponent is optimal and defines a boundary in the sense that asymptotically weaker diffusion permits a breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence at the Ehrenfest timescale. Our presentation aims to be comprehensive and accessible to both mathematicians and physicists. In a shorter companion paper, we treat the special case of Hamiltonians of the form $H=p^2/(2m) + V(x)$ and linear Lindblad operators, with explicit bounds that can be applied directly to physical systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz</title>

Abstract: The recently proposed exact quantum solution for two $\delta$-function-interacting particles with a mass-ratio $3\!:\!1$ in a hard-wall box [Y. Liu, F. Qi, Y. Zhang and S. Chen, iScience 22, 181 (2019)] violates the conventional necessary condition for a Bethe Ansatz integrability, the condition being that the system must be reducible to a superposition of semi-transparent mirrors that is invariant under all the reflections it generates. In this article, we found a way to relax this condition: some of the semi-transparent mirrors of a known self-invariant mirror superposition can be replaced by the perfectly reflecting ones, thus breaking the self-invariance. The proposed name for the method is \emph{Asymmetric Bethe Ansatz} (Asymmetric BA). As a worked example, we study in detail the bound states of the nominally non-integrable system comprised of a bosonic dimer in a $\delta$-well. Finally, we show that the exact solution of the Liu-Qi-Zhang-Chen problem is a particular instance of the the Asymmetric BA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify that the recently proven infinite families of holographic entropy inequalities are maximally tight, i.e. they are facets of the holographic entropy cone. The proof is technical but it offers some heuristic insight. On star graphs, both families of inequalities quantify how concentrated / spread information is with respect to a dihedral symmetry acting on subsystems. In addition, toric inequalities viewed in the K-basis show an interesting interplay between four-party and six-party perfect tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative method to explore gravity's quantum aspects using a novel theoretical framework. Our model delves into gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) while sidestepping classical communication limitations imposed by the LOCC principle. Specifically, we connect a non-relativistic two-dimensional quantum oscillator detector with linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs), leveraging the quantum properties inherent in GWs to observe GIE within the oscillator's quantum states. Because our model adheres to both the ``event" and the ``system" localities, the detected GIE serves as a robust indicator of gravity's quantum nature. Detecting this entanglement via gravitational wave detectors could corroborate gravity's quantization and unveil crucial properties of its sources.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence collection from individual emitters plays a key role in state detection and remote entanglement generation, fundamental functionalities in many quantum platforms. Planar photonics have been demonstrated for robust and scalable addressing of trapped-ion systems, motivating consideration of similar elements for the complementary challenge of photon collection. Here, using an argument from the reciprocity principle, we show that far-field photon collection efficiency can be simply expressed in terms of the fields associated with the collection optic at the emitter position alone. We calculate collection efficiencies into ideal paraxial and fully vectorial focused Gaussian modes parameterized in terms of focal waist, and further quantify the modest enhancements possible with more general beam profiles, establishing design requirements for efficient collection. Towards practical implementation, we design, fabricate, and characterize a diffractive collection element operating at $\lambda=397$ nm predicted to offer a total 0.25\% collection efficiency into a single waveguide mode. A more efficient design with more demanding fabrication requirements would offer $1.14\%$, and we indicate avenues to improved devices approaching the limits predicted for ideal beams. We point out a particularly simple integrated waveguide configuration for polarization-based remote entanglement generation enabled by integrated collection.</description>
