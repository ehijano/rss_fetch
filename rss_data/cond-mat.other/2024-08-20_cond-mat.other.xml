      <title>Euler Characteristic Surfaces: A Stable Multiscale Topological Summary of Time Series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Euler Characteristic Surfaces as a multiscale spatiotemporal topological summary of time series data encapsulating the topology of the system at different time instants and length scales. Euler Characteristic Surfaces with an appropriate metric is used to quantify stability and locate critical changes in a dynamical system with respect to variations in a parameter, while being substantially computationally cheaper than available alternate methods such as persistent homology. The stability of the construction is demonstrated by a quantitative comparison bound with persistent homology, and a quantitative stability bound under small changes in time is established. The proposed construction is used to analyze two different kinds of simulated disordered flow situations.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a Bi-directional Asymmetric Frequency Conversion in Nonlinear Phononic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond the constraints of conservative systems, altering wave propagation frequency emerges as a crucial factor across diverse physical domains. This Letter demonstrates bi-directional asymmetric frequency conversion -- either upward or downward -- depending on the excitation direction in the elastic domain, moving beyond uni-directional approaches. We numerically and experimentally demonstrate its practical realization in a model system of cylindrical beam crystals, a type of granular crystal characterized by intrinsic local resonance. This novel wave transport mechanism operates through the interplay of nonlinear contact, spatial asymmetry, and the coupling of local resonance. Thanks to the proposed highly tunable architecture, we demonstrate various ways to manipulate wave transport, including tunable frequency conversion. Given that the local resonance we employ exemplifies avoided crossings (i.e., a strong coupling effect), our work may inspire investigations into diverse physical nonlinear domains that support material/structural resonance.</description>

      <title>Differential phase contrast from electrons that cause inner shell ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) imaging, in which deviations in the bright field beam are in proportion to the electric field, has been extensively studied in the context of pure elastic scattering. Here we discuss differential phase contrast formed from core-loss scattered electrons, i.e. those that have caused inner shell ionization of atoms in the specimen, using a transition potential approach for which we study the number of final states needed for a converged calculation. In the phase object approximation, we show formally that differential phase contrast formed from core-loss scattered electrons is mainly a result of preservation of elastic contrast. Through simulation we demonstrate that whether the inelastic DPC images show element selective contrast depends on the spatial range of the ionization interaction, and specifically that when the energy loss is low the delocalisation can lead to contributions to the contrast from atoms other than that ionized. We further show that inelastic DPC images remain robustly interpretable to larger thicknesses than is the case for elastic DPC images, owing to the incoherence of the inelastic wavefields, though subtleties due to channelling remain. Lastly, we show that while a very high dose will be needed for sufficient counting statistics to discern differential phase contrast from core-loss scattered electrons, there is some enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio with thickness that makes inelastic DPC imaging more achievable for thicker samples.</description>

      <title>Singular Topological Edge States in Locally Resonant Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Band topology has emerged as a novel tool for material design across various domains, including photonic and phononic systems, and metamaterials. A prominent model for band topology is the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain, which reveals topological in-gap states within Bragg-type gaps (BG) formed by periodic modification. Apart from classical BGs, another mechanism for bandgap formation in metamaterials involves strong coupling between local resonances and propagating waves, resulting in a local resonance-induced bandgap (LRG). Previous studies have shown the challenge of topological edge state emergence within the LRG. Here, we reveal that topological edge states can emerge within an LRG by achieving both topological phase and bandgap transitions simultaneously. We describe this using a model of inversion-symmetric extended SSH chains for locally resonant metamaterials. Notably, this topological state can lead to highly localized modes, comparable to a subwavelength unit cell, when it emerges within the LRG. We experimentally demonstrate distinct differences in topologically protected modes -- highlighted by wave localization -- between the BG and the LRG using locally resonant granule-based metamaterials. Our findings suggest the scope of topological metamaterials may be extended via their bandgap nature.</description>
