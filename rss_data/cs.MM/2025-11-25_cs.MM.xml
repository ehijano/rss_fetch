      <title>Self-Empowering VLMs: Achieving Hierarchical Consistency via Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) possess rich knowledge but often fail on hierarchical understanding tasks, where the goal is to predict a coarse-to-fine taxonomy path that remains consistent across all levels. We compare three inference paradigms for hierarchical VQA and find that stepwise reasoning, when conditioned on prior answers, significantly outperforms single-pass prompting. Further analysis indicates that the main limitation of current VLMs is their inability to maintain cross-level state, rather than a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation (SEKD), which requires no human labels or external tools: the same VLM is prompted to reason step by step and act as a teacher by exposing its hard labels, soft distributions, and decoder hidden states, while a single-pass student distills these signals. The student VLM remains efficient while approaching the accuracy of its multi-step teacher. It improves in-domain path consistency (HCA) by up to +29.50 percentage points, raises zero-shot HCA on an unseen taxonomy from 4.15% to 42.26%, and yields gains on challenging mathematical benchmarks. Because all supervision is self-elicited, SEKD scales to new taxonomies and datasets without annotation cost, providing a practical route to imbue compact VLMs with dependency-aware multi-step reasoning.</description>

      <title>When Top-ranked Recommendations Fail: Modeling Multi-Granular Negative Feedback for Explainable and Robust Video Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing video recommendation systems, relying mainly on ID-based embedding mapping and collaborative filtering, often fail to capture in-depth video content semantics. Moreover, most struggle to address biased user behaviors (e.g., accidental clicks, fast skips), leading to inaccurate interest modeling and frequent negative feedback in top recommendations with unclear causes. To tackle this issue, we collect real-world user video-watching sequences, annotate the reasons for users' dislikes, and construct a benchmark dataset for personalized explanations. We then introduce the Agentic Explainable Negative Feedback (ENF) framework, which integrates three core components: (1) the Profile Agent, extracting behavioral cues from users' historical data to derive psychological and personality profiles; (2) the Video Agent, performing comprehensive multimodal video analysis; and (3) the Reason Agent, synthesizing information from the other two agents to predict user engagement and generate explanations. Additionally, we propose the S-GRPO algorithm, enabling the model to progressively address complex tasks during reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in negative feedback prediction and reason explanation. Notably, it achieves an 8.6% improvement over GPT-4o in reason classification. Deployment on the business platform further validates its benefits: increasing average user watch time by 6.2%, reducing the fast-skip rate by 9.4%, and significantly enhancing user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalizable Deepfake Detection via Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation: A Variational Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread application of AIGC contents has brought not only unprecedented opportunities, but also potential security concerns, e.g., audio-visual deepfakes. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective and generalizable method for multi-modal deepfake detection. Typically, the audio-visual correlation learning could expose subtle cross-modal inconsistencies, e.g., audio-visual misalignment, which serve as crucial clues in deepfake detection. In this paper, we reformulate the correlation learning with variational Bayesian estimation, where audio-visual correlation is approximated as a Gaussian distributed latent variable, and thus develop a novel framework for deepfake detection, i.e., Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation with Variational Bayes (FoVB). Specifically, given the prior knowledge of pre-trained backbones, we adopt two core designs to estimate audio-visual correlations effectively. First, we exploit various difference convolutions and a high-pass filter to discern local and global forgery traces from both modalities. Second, with the extracted forgery-aware features, we estimate the latent Gaussian variable of audio-visual correlation via variational Bayes. Then, we factorize the variable into modality-specific and correlation-specific ones with orthogonality constraint, allowing them to better learn intra-modal and cross-modal forgery traces with less entanglement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FoVB outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>PrismSSL: One Interface, Many Modalities; A Single-Interface Library for Multimodal Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PrismSSL, a Python library that unifies state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) methods across audio, vision, graphs, and cross-modal settings in a single, modular codebase. The goal of the demo is to show how researchers and practitioners can: (i) install, configure, and run pretext training with a few lines of code; (ii) reproduce compact benchmarks; and (iii) extend the framework with new modalities or methods through clean trainer and dataset abstractions. PrismSSL is packaged on PyPI, released under the MIT license, integrates tightly with HuggingFace Transformers, and provides quality-of-life features such as distributed training in PyTorch, Optuna-based hyperparameter search, LoRA fine-tuning for Transformer backbones, animated embedding visualizations for sanity checks, Weights &amp; Biases logging, and colorful, structured terminal logs for improved usability and clarity. In addition, PrismSSL offers a graphical dashboard - built with Flask and standard web technologies - that enables users to configure and launch training pipelines with minimal coding. The artifact (code and data recipes) will be publicly available and reproducible.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Signal: Selective Interaction and Global-local Alignment for Multi-Modal Object Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) is devoted to retrieving specific objects through the exploitation of complementary multi-modal image information. Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

      <title>Tu crois que c'est vrai ? Diversite des regimes d'enonciation face aux fake news et mecanismes d'autoregulation conversationnelle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis addresses two paradoxes: (1) why empirical studies find that fake news represent only a small share of the information consulted and shared on social media despite the absence of editorial control or journalistic norms, and (2) how political polarization has intensified even though users do not appear especially receptive to fake news. To investigate these issues, two complementary studies were carried out on Twitter and Facebook, combining quantitative analyses of digital traces with online observation and interviews. This mixed-methods design avoids reducing users to single reactions to identified fake items and instead examines the variety of practices across different interactional situations, online and offline, while recording socio-demographic traits. The first study mapped users who shared at least one item labeled fake by fact-checkers in the French Twittersphere. The second used a corpus of items flagged by Facebook users to study reactions to statements whose epistemic status is uncertain. Three main findings emerge. First, sharing fake news is concentrated among a limited group of users who are not less educated or cognitively disadvantaged but are more politicized and critical of institutions; owing to their high activity and prolific sharing, they can help set the agenda for their political camp. Second, exposed users can deploy varying forms of critical distance depending on their social position and the interactional norms of the situations they inhabit: either discursive caution (prudence \'enonciative) or interventions ('points d'arr\^et') that express disagreement or corrections. Third, these forms of critical distance seldom yield genuine deliberative debates or agonistic pluralism; rather, they often produce dialogues of the deaf among a small, particularly active minority.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Hardware-based Video Encoders on Modern GPUs for UHD Live-Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many GPUs have incorporated hardware-accelerated video encoders, which allow video encoding tasks to be offloaded from the main CPU and provide higher power efficiency. Over the years, many new video codecs such as H.265/HEVC, VP9, and AV1 were added to the latest GPU boards. Recently, the rise of live video content such as VTuber, game live-streaming, and live event broadcasts, drives the demand for high-efficiency hardware encoders in the GPUs to tackle these real-time video encoding tasks, especially at higher resolutions such as 4K/8K UHD. In this paper, RD performance, encoding speed, as well as power consumption of hardware encoders in several generations of NVIDIA, Intel GPUs as well as Qualcomm Snapdragon Mobile SoCs were evaluated and compared to the software counterparts, including the latest H.266/VVC codec, using several metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and machine-learning based VMAF. The results show that modern GPU hardware encoders can match the RD performance of software encoders in real-time encoding scenarios, and while encoding speed increased in newer hardware, there is mostly negligible RD performance improvement between hardware generations. Finally, the bitrate required for each hardware encoder to match YouTube transcoding quality was also calculated.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evolution of a comprehensive multimodal room-monitoring system that integrates synchronized video and audio processing for real-time activity recognition and anomaly detection. We describe two iterations of the system: an initial lightweight implementation using YOLOv8, ByteTrack, and the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and an advanced version that incorporates multi-model audio ensembles, hybrid object detection, bidirectional cross-modal attention, and multi-method anomaly detection. The evolution demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and industrial applicability. The advanced system combines three audio models (AST, Wav2Vec2, and HuBERT) for comprehensive audio understanding, dual object detectors (YOLO and DETR) for improved accuracy, and sophisticated fusion mechanisms for enhanced cross-modal learning. Experimental evaluation shows the system's effectiveness in general monitoring scenarios as well as specialized industrial safety applications, achieving real-time performance on standard hardware while maintaining high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Neural B-Frame Coding: Tackling Domain Shift Issues with Lightweight Online Motion Resolution Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity. The code is available at: https://github.com/NYCU-MAPL/Fast-OMRA.git.</description>

      <title>Parallel Vision Token Scheduling for Fast and Accurate Multimodal LMMs Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deliver impressive vision-language reasoning but suffer steep inference latency because self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length and thousands of visual tokens contributed by high-resolution images. Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.</description>

      <title>BioArtlas: Computational Clustering of Multi-Dimensional Complexity in Bioart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bioart's hybrid nature spanning art, science, technology, ethics, and politics defies traditional single-axis categorization. I present BioArtlas, analyzing 81 bioart works across thirteen curated dimensions using novel axis-aware representations that preserve semantic distinctions while enabling cross-dimensional comparison. Our codebook-based approach groups related concepts into unified clusters, addressing polysemy in cultural terminology. Comprehensive evaluation of up to 800 representation-space-algorithm combinations identifies Agglomerative clustering at k=15 on 4D UMAP as optimal (silhouette 0.664 +/- 0.008, trustworthiness/continuity 0.805/0.812). The approach reveals four organizational patterns: artist-specific methodological cohesion, technique-based segmentation, temporal artistic evolution, and trans-temporal conceptual affinities. By separating analytical optimization from public communication, I provide rigorous analysis and accessible exploration through an interactive web interface (https://www.bioartlas.com) with the dataset publicly available (https://github.com/joonhyungbae/BioArtlas).</description>

      <title>VDC-Agent: When Video Detailed Captioners Evolve Themselves via Agentic Self-Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Generative Categories and Techniques in Multimodal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10016</link>

Abstract: Multimodal Generative Models (MGMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music, video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends, and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques and unresolved challenges. Building on a common taxonomy of models and training recipes, we propose a unified evaluation framework centred on faithfulness, compositionality, and robustness, and synthesise evidence from benchmarks and human studies across modalities. We further analyse trustworthiness, safety, and ethical risks, including multimodal bias, privacy leakage, and the misuse of high-fidelity media generation for deepfakes, disinformation, and copyright infringement in music and 3D assets, together with emerging mitigation strategies. Finally, we discuss how architectural trends, evaluation protocols, and governance mechanisms can be co-designed to close current capability and safety gaps, outlining critical paths toward more general-purpose, controllable, and accountable multimodal generative systems.</description>

      <title>FinAudio: A Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models in Financial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs) have received widespread attention and have significantly improved performance on audio tasks such as conversation, audio understanding, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). Despite these advancements, there is an absence of a benchmark for assessing AudioLLMs in financial scenarios, where audio data, such as earnings conference calls and CEO speeches, are crucial resources for financial analysis and investment decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{FinAudio}, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capacity of AudioLLMs in the financial domain. We first define three tasks based on the unique characteristics of the financial domain: 1) ASR for short financial audio, 2) ASR for long financial audio, and 3) summarization of long financial audio. Then, we curate two short and two long audio datasets, respectively, and develop a novel dataset for financial audio summarization, comprising the \textsc{FinAudio} benchmark. Then, we evaluate seven prevalent AudioLLMs on \textsc{FinAudio}. Our evaluation reveals the limitations of existing AudioLLMs in the financial domain and offers insights for improving AudioLLMs. All datasets and codes will be released.</description>

      <title>Spatial Knowledge Graph-Guided Multimodal Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22633v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities; however, their spatial perception abilities remain a notable limitation. To address this challenge, multimodal data synthesis offers a promising solution. Yet, ensuring that synthesized data adhere to spatial common sense is a non-trivial task. Our approach addresses this critical gap by providing a systematic framework for generating spatially coherent data. In this work, we introduce SKG2DATA, a novel multimodal synthesis approach guided by spatial knowledge graphs, grounded in the concept of knowledge-to-data generation. SKG2DATA employs an automated pipeline for constructing Spatial Knowledge Graph (SKG) that effectively captures human-like spatial cognition, including directional and distance relationships. These structured representations then serve as precise guidance for our integrated synthesis pipeline, where a diffusion model generates spatially-consistent images while a MLLM produces corresponding textual descriptions. The automated construction of SKG enables scalable generation of diverse yet realistic spatial configurations, overcoming the limitations of manual data collection and annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that data synthesized from diverse types of spatial knowledge, including direction and distance, enhance the spatial perception and reasoning abilities of MLLMs markedly, albeit with a slight cost to their general capabilities. We hope that the idea of knowledge-based data synthesis can advance the development of spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/Knowledge2Data.</description>

      <title>D-FCGS: Feedforward Compression of Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Free-Viewpoint Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Free-Viewpoint Video (FVV) enables immersive 3D experiences, but efficient compression of dynamic 3D representation remains a major challenge. Existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting methods couple reconstruction with optimization-dependent compression and customized motion formats, limiting generalization and standardization. To address this, we propose D-FCGS, a novel Feedforward Compression framework for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Key innovations include: (1) a standardized Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P coding, leveraging sparse control points to extract inter-frame motion tensors; (2) a dual prior-aware entropy model that fuses hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation; (3) a control-point-guided motion compensation mechanism and refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on Gaussian frames derived from multi-view videos, D-FCGS generalizes across diverse scenes in a zero-shot fashion. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 40 times compression compared to the baseline while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression of dynamic 3DGS, facilitating scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.</description>

      <title>Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from Human to AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI Video Chat emerges as a new paradigm for Real-time Communication (RTC), where one peer is not a human, but a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). This makes interaction between humans and AI more intuitive, as if chatting face-to-face with a real person. However, this poses significant challenges to latency, because the MLLM inference takes up most of the response time, leaving very little time for video streaming. Due to network uncertainty, transmission latency becomes a critical bottleneck preventing AI from being like a real person. To address this, we call for AI-oriented RTC research, exploring the network requirement shift from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". We begin by recognizing the main differences between AI Video Chat and traditional RTC. Then, through prototype measurements, we identify that ultra-low bitrate is a key factor for low latency. To reduce bitrate dramatically while maintaining MLLM accuracy, we propose Context-Aware Video Streaming that recognizes the importance of each video region for chat and allocates bitrate almost exclusively to chat-important regions. To evaluate the impact of video streaming quality on MLLM accuracy, we build the first benchmark, named Degraded Video Understanding Benchmark (DeViBench). Finally, we discuss some open questions and ongoing solutions for AI Video Chat. DeViBench is open-sourced at: https://github.com/pku-netvideo/DeViBench.</description>

      <title>Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.</description>

      <title>CommonVoice-SpeechRE and RPG-MoGe: Advancing Speech Relation Extraction with a New Dataset and Multi-Order Generative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech Relation Extraction (SpeechRE) aims to extract relation triplets directly from speech. However, existing benchmark datasets rely heavily on synthetic data, lacking sufficient quantity and diversity of real human speech. Moreover, existing models also suffer from rigid single-order generation templates and weak semantic alignment, substantially limiting their performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CommonVoice-SpeechRE, a large-scale dataset comprising nearly 20,000 real-human speech samples from diverse speakers, establishing a new benchmark for SpeechRE research. Furthermore, we propose the Relation Prompt-Guided Multi-Order Generative Ensemble (RPG-MoGe), a novel framework that features: (1) a multi-order triplet generation ensemble strategy, leveraging data diversity through diverse element orders during both training and inference, and (2) CNN-based latent relation prediction heads that generate explicit relation prompts to guide cross-modal alignment and accurate triplet generation. Experiments show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing both a benchmark dataset and an effective solution for real-world SpeechRE. The source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/NingJinzhong/SpeechRE_RPG_MoGe.</description>
