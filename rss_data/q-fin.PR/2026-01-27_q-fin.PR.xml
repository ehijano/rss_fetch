      <title>VIX and European options with jumps in the short-maturity regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the short-maturity asymptotics for VIX and European option prices in local-stochastic volatility models with compound Poisson jumps. Both out-of-the-money (OTM) and at-the-money (ATM) asymptotics are considered. The leading-order asymptotics are obtained in closed-form. We apply our results to three examples: the Eraker model, a Kou-type model, and a folded normal model. Numerical illustrations are provided for these three examples that show the accuracy of predictions based on the asymptotic results.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategy and deep hedging for share repurchase programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, companies have frequently adopted share repurchase programs to return capital to shareholders or for other strategic purposes, instructing investment banks to rapidly buy back shares on their behalf. When the executing institution is allowed to hedge its exposure, it encounters several challenges due to the intrinsic features of the product. Moreover, contractual clauses or market regulations on trading activity may make it infeasible to rely on Greeks. In this work, we address the hedging of these products by developing a machine-learning framework that determines the optimal execution of the buyback while explicitly accounting for the bank's actual trading capabilities. This unified treatment of execution and hedging yields substantial performance improvements, resulting in an optimized policy that provides a feasible and realistic hedging approach. The pricing of these programs can be framed in terms of the discount that banks offer to the client on the price at which the shares are delivered. Since, in our framework, risk measures serve as objective functions, we exploit the concept of indifference pricing to compute this discount, thereby capturing the actual execution performance.</description>

      <title>The Compounded BSDE method: A fully-forward method for option pricing and optimal stopping problems in finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Compound BSDE method, a fully forward, deep-learning-based approach for solving a broad class of problems in financial mathematics, including optimal stopping. The method is based on a reformulation of option pricing problems in terms of a system of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), which offers a new perspective on the numerical treatment of compound options and optimal stopping problems such as Bermudan option pricing. Building on the classical deep BSDE method for a single BSDE, we develop an algorithm for compound BSDEs and establish its convergence properties. In particular, we derive an \emph{a posteriori} error estimate for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach, and illustrate its effectiveness for high-dimensional option pricing and optimal stopping problems.</description>

      <title>A Derivative Pricing Perspective on Liquidity Tokens in Constant Product Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In decentralized finance, any individual can pool their assets into an automated market maker (AMM) -- herein we focus on the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- in exchange for a claim on a fraction of future pool assets and fees earned from the market making operations. This position is represented by a liquidity token, whose prevailing on-chain price is effectively the initial deposited assets. Though this price is well-defined, we treat the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM in order to deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result. Adopting this perspective, in a frictionless environment, hedging the CPMM liquidity token under fair valuation should produce a riskless process, which therefore grows at the risk-free rate, something that is not seen in empirical case studies under the prevailing price. With our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) valuation which is consistent with the (near-continuous) replication strategy out-of-sample. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM design considerations motivated by this derivative-pricing perspective.</description>
