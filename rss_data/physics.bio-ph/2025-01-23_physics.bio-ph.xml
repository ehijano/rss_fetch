      <title>Efficient treatment of heterogeneous malignant cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When confronted with an undesired cell population, such as bacterial infections or tumors, we seek the most effective treatment, designed to eliminate the population as rapidly as possible. A common practice is to monitor the cells short-term response to the treatment, and from that, extrapolate the eventual treatment outcome, i.e. will it eradicate the cells, and if yes at what timescales. Underlying this approach is the assumption that the cells exhibit a homogeneous response to the treatment, and hence the early response patterns can be naturally extended to later times. Recent experiments on cancer cell populations, however, indicate a significant level of cellular heterogeneity, undermining this classic assessment protocol of treatment efficacy. We, therefore, develop here a stochastic framework, to analytically predict the temporal dynamics of a heterogeneous cell population. Quite often, we find, the average cellular parameters, governing the short-term response, fail to predict the actual treatment outcome. In contrast, our analysis, which also incorporates the populations variability, helps identify the relevant statistical parameters, which in turn, enable us to predict the full trajectory of the cell population, and specifically - the likelihood and typical timescales for remission.</description>

      <title>Recognizing and generating knotted molecular structures by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knotted molecules occur naturally and are designed by scientists to gain special biological and material properties. Understanding and utilizing knotting require efficient methods to recognize and generate knotted structures, which are unsolved problems in mathematics and physics. Here, we solve these two problems using machine learning. First, our Transformer-based neural network (NN) can recognize the knot types of given chain conformations with an accuracy of $&gt;99\%$. We can use a single NN model to recognize knots with different chain lengths, and our computational speed is about 4500 times faster than the most popular mathematical method for knot recognition: the Alexander polynomials. Second, we for the first time design a diffusion-based NN model to generate conformations for given knot types. The generated conformations satisfy not only the desired knot types, but also the correct physical distributions of the radii of gyration and knot sizes. The results have several implications. First, the Transformer is suitable for handling knotting tasks, probably because of its strength in processing sequence information, a key component in knotting. Second, our NN can replace mathematical methods of knot recognition for faster speed on many occasions. Third, our models can facilitate the design of knotted protein structures. Lastly, analyzing how NN recognizes knot types can provide insight into the principle behind knots, an unsolved problem in mathematics. We provide an online website (http://144.214.24.236) for using our models.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>

      <title>Single-shot volumetric fluorescence imaging with neural fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-shot volumetric fluorescence (SVF) imaging offers a significant advantage over traditional imaging methods that require scanning across multiple axial planes as it can capture biological processes with high temporal resolution. The key challenges in SVF imaging include requiring sparsity constraints, eliminating depth ambiguity in the reconstruction, and maintaining high resolution across a large field of view. In this paper, we introduce the QuadraPol point spread function (PSF) combined with neural fields, a novel approach for SVF imaging. This method utilizes a custom polarizer at the back focal plane and a polarization camera to detect fluorescence, effectively encoding the 3D scene within a compact PSF without depth ambiguity. Additionally, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the neural fields technique that provides improved reconstruction quality compared to classical deconvolution methods. QuadraPol PSF, combined with neural fields, significantly reduces the acquisition time of a conventional fluorescence microscope by approximately 20 times and captures a 100 mm$^3$ cubic volume in one shot. We validate the effectiveness of both our hardware and algorithm through all-in-focus imaging of bacterial colonies on sand surfaces and visualization of plant root morphology. Our approach offers a powerful tool for advancing biological research and ecological studies.</description>

      <title>Condensate Size Control by Net Charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are complex droplets comprising diverse molecules that interact using various mechanisms. Condensation is often driven by short-ranged attraction, but net charges can also mediate long-ranged repulsion. Using molecular dynamics simulations and an equilibrium field theory, we show that such opposing interactions can suppress coarsening so that many droplets of equal size coexist at equilibrium. This size control depends strongly on the charge asymmetry between constituents, while the strength of the short-ranged attractions has a weak influence. Essentially, droplets expel ions, so they cannot screen electrostatics effectively, implying droplets acquire a net charge and cannot grow indefinitely. Our work reveals how electrostatic effects control droplet size, which is relevant for understanding biomolecular condensates and creating synthetic patterns in chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. We demonstrate that statistical errors due to insufficient sampling are substantial and propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</description>
