      <title>VSS Challenge Problem: Verifying the Correctness of AllReduce Algorithms in the MPICH Implementation of MPI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a challenge problem for verification based on the MPICH implementation of MPI. The MPICH implementation includes several algorithms for allreduce, all of which should be functionally equivalent to reduce followed by broadcast. We created standalone versions of three algorithms and verified two of them using CIVL.</description>

      <title>Specification and Verification for Climate Modeling: Formalization Leading to Impactful Tooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth System Models (ESMs) are critical for understanding past climates and projecting future scenarios. However, the complexity of these models, which include large code bases, a wide community of developers, and diverse computational platforms, poses significant challenges for software quality assurance. The increasing adoption of GPUs and heterogeneous architectures further complicates verification efforts. Traditional verification methods often rely on bitwise reproducibility, which is not always feasible, particularly under new compilers or hardware. Manual expert evaluation, on the other hand, is subjective and time-consuming. Formal methods offer a mathematically rigorous alternative, yet their application in ESM development has been limited due to the lack of climate model-specific representations and tools. Here, we advocate for the broader adoption of formal methods in climate modeling. In particular, we identify key aspects of ESMs that are well suited to formal specification and introduce abstraction approaches for a tailored framework. To demonstrate this approach, we present a case study using CIVL model checker to formally verify a bug fix in an ocean mixing parameterization scheme. Our goal is to develop accessible, domain-specific formal tools that enhance model confidence and support more efficient and reliable ESM development.</description>

      <title>Verification Challenge: Fractional Cascading for Multi-Nuclide Grid Lookup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a verification challenge based on the fractional cascading (FC) technique for accelerating repeated searches across a collection of sorted arrays. The specific context is nuclear cross section lookup in a simulation code, where a material consists of many nuclides, each with its own sorted energy grid. A naive search performs a binary search in each array individually. The FC-based cascade grid structure reduces this cost by performing a single binary search followed by constant-time refinements. The challenge consists of verifying the correctness of the FC algorithm with respect to the naive approach and validating its structural properties.</description>

      <title>Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman &amp; Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].</description>

      <title>From Minimal Existence to Human Definition: The CES-IMU-HSG Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories, employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of 'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition, which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining existence of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a machine-checked correctness proof of a C program that converts a coordinate-form (COO) sparse matrix to a compressed-sparse-row (CSR) matrix. The classic algorithm (sort the COO entries in lexicographic order by row,column; fill in the CSR arrays left to right) is concise but has rather intricate invariants. We illustrate a bottom-up methodology for deriving the invariants from the program.</description>

      <title>Message Passing on the Edge: Towards Scalable and Expressive GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose EB-1WL, an edge-based color-refinement test, and a corresponding GNN architecture, EB-GNN. Our architecture is inspired by a classic triangle counting algorithm by Chiba and Nishizeki, and explicitly uses triangles during message passing. We achieve the following results: (1)~EB-1WL is significantly more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures, EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient general-purpose architecture: It substantially outperforms simple MPNNs, and remains competitive with task-specialized GNNs while being significantly more computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Controlling unfolding in type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new way to control the unfolding of definitions in dependent type theory. Traditionally, proof assistants require users to fix whether each definition will or will not be unfolded in the remainder of a development; unfolding definitions is often necessary in order to reason about them, but an excess of unfolding can result in brittle proofs and intractably large proof goals. In our system, definitions are by default not unfolded, but users can selectively unfold them in a local manner. We justify our mechanism by means of elaboration to a core theory with extension types -- a connective first introduced in the context of homotopy type theory -- and by establishing a normalization theorem for our core calculus. We have implemented controlled unfolding in the cooltt proof assistant, inspiring an independent implementation in Agda.</description>

      <title>A Proof-theoretic Semantics for Intuitionistic Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approach taken by Gheorghiu, Gu and Pym in their paper on giving a Base-extension Semantics for Intuitionistic Multiplicative Linear Logic is an interesting adaptation of the work of Sandqvist for IPL to the substructural setting. What is particularly interesting is how naturally the move to the substructural setting provided a semantics for the multiplicative fragment of intuitionistic linear logic. Whilst ultimately the Gheorghiu, Gu and Pym used their foundations to provide a semantics for bunched implication logic, it begs the question, what of the rest of intuitionistic linear logic? In this paper, I present just such a semantics. This is particularly of interest as this logic has as a connective the bang, a modal connective. Capturing the inferentialist content of formulas marked with this connective is particularly challenging and a discussion is dedicated to this at the end of the paper.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.

Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.

We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.

This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

Abstract: It was recently shown by Atserias, Buss and Mueller that the standard complexity-theoretic conjecture NEXP not in P / poly is consistent with the relatively strong bounded arithmetic theory V^0_2, which can prove a substantial part of complexity theory. We observe that their approach can be extended to show that the stronger conjectures NEXP not in EXP / poly and NEXP not in coNEXP are consistent with a stronger theory, which includes every true universal number-sort sentence.</description>

      <title>Dependency Pairs for Expected Innermost Runtime Complexity and Strong Almost-Sure Termination of Probabilistic Term Rewriting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dependency pair (DP) framework is one of the most powerful techniques for automatic termination and complexity analysis of term rewrite systems. While DPs were extended to prove almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems (PTRSs), automatic complexity analysis for PTRSs is largely unexplored. We introduce the first DP framework for analyzing expected complexity and for proving positive or strong almost-sure termination (SAST) of innermost rewriting with PTRSs, i.e., finite expected runtime. We implemented our framework in the tool AProVE and demonstrate its power compared to existing techniques for proving SAST.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modal study of the notion of bisimulation. Our contribution is twofold. First, we extend the basic modal language with a new modality [b], whose intended meaning is universal quantification over all states that are bisimilar to the current one. We show that bisimulations are definable in this object language. Second, we provide a sound and complete axiomatisation of the class of all pairs of Kripke models linked by bisimulations.</description>

      <title>Dependent Multiplicities in Dependent Linear Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel dependent linear type theory in which the multiplicity of some variable - i.e., the number of times the variable can be used in a program - can depend on other variables. This allows us to give precise resource annotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in any other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline is obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying how the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a standard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with dependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a combination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our system can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate with an implementation in Agda.</description>
