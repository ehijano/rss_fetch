      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Preliminary Antenna Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the basic design of a large, light weight, spaceborne antenna for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (space-VLBI) mission, achieving high efficiency operation at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. An introductory overview of the mission and its science background are provided. The BHEX mission targets fundamental black hole physics enabled by the detection of the finely structured image feature around black holes known as the photon ring, theoretically expected due to light orbiting the black hole before reaching the observer. Interferometer baselines much longer than an earth diameter are necessary to attain the spatial resolution required to detect the photon ring, leading to a space component. The science goals require high sensitivity observations at mm/sub-mm wavelengths, placing stringent constraints on antenna performance. The design approach described, seeks to balance the antenna aperture, volume and mass constraints of the NASA Explorers mission opportunity profile and the desired high performance. A 3.5 m aperture with a 40 $\mu$m surface rms is targeted. Currently, a symmetric, dual reflector, axially displaced ellipse (Gregorian ring focus) optical design and metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sandwich construction have been chosen to deliver high efficiency and light weight. Further exploration of design choices and parameter space and reflector shaping studies are in progress</description>

      <title>Extended Cyclotron Resonant Heating of the Turbulent Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized, nearly parallel propagating waves are prevalent in the solar wind at ion-kinetic scales. At these scales, the spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind steepens, often called the transition-range, before flattening at sub-ion scales. Circularly polarized waves have been proposed as a mechanism to couple electromagnetic fluctuations to ion gyromotion, enabling ion-scale dissipation that results in observed ion-scale steepening. Here, we study Parker Solar Probe observations of an extended stream of fast solar wind ranging from 15-55 solar radii. We demonstrate that, throughout the stream, transition-range steepening at ion-scales is associated with the presence of significant left handed ion-kinetic scale waves, which are thought to be ion-cyclotron waves. We implement quasilinear theory to compute the rate at which ions are heated via cyclotron resonance with the observed circularly polarized waves given the empirically measured proton velocity distribution functions. We apply the Von Karman decay law to estimate the turbulent decay of the large-scale fluctuations, which is equal to the turbulent energy cascade rate. We find that the ion-cyclotron heating rates are correlated with, and amount to a significant fraction of, the turbulent energy cascade rate, implying that cyclotron heating is an important dissipation mechanism in the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Heating and Parallel Heat Flux in Electron-only Magnetic Reconnection with Intense Guide Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-only reconnection is a process recently observed in the Earth's magnetosheath, where magnetic reconnection occurs at electron kinetic scales with only electrons involved. Electron-only reconnection is likely to have a significant impact on the energy conversion and dissipation of turbulence cascades at kinetic scales. This paper investigates electron-only reconnection under different intensities of strong guide fields via two-dimensional fully kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, focusing on electron heating. The simulations are initialized with a force-free current sheet equilibrium under various intensities of strong guide fields. The quadrupolar structures of the out-of-plane magnetic field and asymmetric structures of density are found to become narrower in space as the guide field increases. Electron velocities are considerably larger than ion velocities, and the motion of both species is notably affected by the strength of guide fields. Similarly to previous experiments studies, electron temperature anisotropy along separatrices is observed, which is found to be mainly caused by the variations of parallel temperature. Both regions of anisotropy and parallel temperature increase/decrease along separatrices become thinner with increasing guide fields. Besides, we find a transition from a quadrupolar to a six-polar to an eight-polar structure in temperature anisotropy and parallel temperature as the guide field intensifies. Non-Maxwellian electron velocity distribution functions (EVDFs) at different locations in the three simulations are observed. Our results show that parallel electron velocity varies notably with different guide field intensities and strong parallel electron heat flux is observed.</description>

      <title>GRAPH -- An readout ASIC for large MCP based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a programmable 16 channel, mixed signal, low power readout ASIC, having the project historically named Gigasample Recorder of Analog waveforms from a PHotodetector (GRAPH). It is designed to read large aperture single photon imaging detectors using micro channel plates for charge multiplication, and measuring the detector's response on crossed strips anodes to extrapolate the incoming photon position. Each channel consists of a fast, low power and low noise charge sensitive amplifier, which provides a myriad of coarse and fine programmable options for gain and shaping settings. Further, the amplified signal is recorded using, to our knowledge novel, the Hybrid Universal sampLing Architecture (HULA), a mixed signal double buffer memory, that enables concurrent waveform recording, and selected event digitized data extraction. The sampling frequency is freely adjustable between few~kHz up to 125~MHz, while the chip's internal digital memory holds a history 2048 samples for each channel, with a digital headroom of 12 bits. An optimized region of interest sample-read algorithm allows to extract the information just around the event pulse peak, while selecting the next event, thus substantially reducing the operational dead time. The chip is designed in 130~$n$m TSMC CMOS technology, and its power consumption is around 47~$m$W per channel.</description>

      <title>Whistler waves in the quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular magnetosheath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Earth's magnetosheath (MSH), several processes contribute to energy dissipation and plasma heating, one of which is wave-particle interactions between whistler waves and electrons. However, the overall impact of whistlers on electron dynamics in the MSH remains to be quantified. We analyze 18 hours of burst-mode measurements from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, including data from the unbiased magnetosheath campaign during February-March 2023. We present a statistical study of 34,409 whistler waves found using automatic detection. We compare wave occurrence in the different MSH geometries and find three times higher occurrence in the quasi-perpendicular MSH compared to the quasi-parallel case. We also study the wave properties and find that the waves propagate quasi-parallel to the background magnetic field, have a median frequency of 0.2 times the electron cyclotron frequency, median amplitude of 0.03-0.06 nT (30-60 pT), and median duration of a few tens of wave periods. The whistler waves are preferentially observed in local magnetic dips and density peaks and are not associated with an increased temperature anisotropy. Also, almost no whistlers are observed in regions with parallel electron plasma beta lower than 0.1. Importantly, when estimating pitch-angle diffusion times we find that the whistler waves cause significant pitch-angle scattering of electrons in the MSH.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\textit{AIMS.}$ (1) To use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to test the accepted theory that type-III radiation is produced by counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the electromagnetic wave at twice the Langmuir frequency. (2) To use the new data obtained from the PSP to improve or modify the model of type-III wave generation.
  $\textit{METHODS.}$ To obtain new properties of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics, their phase velocities and density fluctuations were measured. If the harmonic wave was electromagnetic, as in the accepted theory, these quantities would not be measurable. However, in an electrostatic wave, they would be measurable by the PSP instruments.
  $\textit{RESULTS.}$ The Langmuir wave and its harmonics at frequencies of $n\omega_p$, where $\omega_p = 2\pi\times125$ kHz is the Langmuir frequency and $n \in \{ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}$, were measured in an active type-III event. The lowest harmonics contained density fluctuations, so they were electrostatic waves and not type-III emissions. This result was bolstered by measuring their very slow phase velocities ($&lt; 20,000$ km/sec) which are not those of a type-III wave. Thus, the harmonic waves were not a result of the three-wave interaction (as required by the accepted theory) but they were electrostatic antenna waves produced by radiation of the Langmuir wave. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation. It is also found that there is no evidence for or against the conventional model for generation of the type-III emissions.</description>

      <title>Type IV-like Solar Radio Burst Consisting of a Series of Spikes Observed by PSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar and interplanetary radio bursts can reflect the existence and motion of energetic electrons and are therefore a kind of vital phenomenon in solar activities. The present study reported a solar radio burst (SRB) event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in its 8th orbital encounter phase, and it lasted about 20 hours in a frequency range of 0.5-15 MHz, called the type IV-like SRB. This type IV-like SRB consists of a series of numerous spikes with the center-frequency drifting slowly from ~5 MHz to ~1 MHz, and each individual spike appears a much faster frequency drifting and has a narrow frequency range of a few MHz and short duration of a few minutes. Based on the empirical models of the solar atmosphere adopted commonly, combining the in-situ measurement by PSP, we propose that these small-scale spikes were generated by a group of solitary kinetic Alfv\'en waves (SKAWs) in a magnetic loop accompanying coronal mass ejection (CME) and moving outwards, in which the frequency drifting of individual spike is caused by the SKAW's propagation and the center-frequency drifting may be attributed to the motion of the magnetic loop.</description>
