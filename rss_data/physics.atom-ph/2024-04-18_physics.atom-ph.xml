      <title>Generation of a precise time scale assisted by a near-continuously operating optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a reduced time variation of a time scale with respect to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) by steering a hydrogen-maser-based time scale with a near-continuously operating optical lattice clock. The time scale is generated in a post-processing analysis for 230 days with a hydrogen maser with its fractional frequency stability limited by a flicker floor of $2\times10^{-15}$ and an Yb optical lattice clock operated with an uptime of 81.6 $\%$. During the 230-day period, the root mean square time variation of our time scale with respect to UTC is 0.52 ns, which is a better performance compared with those of time scales steered by microwave fountain clocks that exhibit root mean square variations from 0.99 ns to 1.6 ns. With the high uptime achieved by the Yb optical lattice clock, our simulation implies the potential of generating a state-of-the-art time scale with a time variation of $&lt;0.1$ ns over a month using a better hydrogen maser reaching the mid $10^{-16}$ level. This work demonstrates that a use of an optical clock with a high uptime enhances the stability of a time scale.</description>

      <title>A VUV light source for enhanced production of metastable krypton and xenon beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate excitation of metastable krypton and xenon beams using a vacuum ultraviolet lamp and directly compare the performance of this method to metastable excitation based on a radiofrequency-driven plasma discharge. In our apparatus, lamp-based metastable excitation outperforms the plasma discharge across a wide range of beam flux values relevant for Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA). Moreover, we do not observe significant degradation in lamp performance after over 160 hours of operation. We find that lamp-based excitation is particularly advantageous at the smallest and largest beam fluxes tested, demonstrating the utility of this approach both for improving krypton ATTA and for enabling the detection of radioactive xenon isotopes using ATTA. Finally, we demonstrate an additional enhancement to lamp-based metastable excitation efficiency and stability by applying an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Elastic scattering of Laguerre-Gaussian electron packets on atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore elastic scattering of non-relativistic electrons in the form of standard Laguerre-Gaussian (sLG) and elegant Laguerre - Gaussian (eLG) packets on atomic targets in the generalized Born approximation and compare these results to the reference with Bessel-Gaussian (BG) packets. Scattering by hydrogen-like, iron, silver, and golden targets is considered. The incident electron carries a nonzero orbital angular momentum, while sLG and eLG packets have a definite radial quantum number n as well. In scattering of sLG and eLG wave packets by a macroscopic target sensitivity of the average cross section to the orbital angular momentum is observed, which is absent for BG packets. We highlight the opportunity to employ the differences in the experimental scattering results for the revelation of the properties of incident twisted electron wave packets</description>

      <title>Conversion of twistedness from light to atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple model and propose a scheme that allows the production of twisted atoms in free space using the absorption of twisted photons by a bound electron. We show that in the inelastic collision of a photon and an atom, the twisted state of the photon is transferred to the center-of-mass state, so that the projection of the orbital momentum of the atom becomes $m_\gamma-\Delta m_e$. We also show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the twistedness of the photon is either transferred to the atomic center-of-mass quantum state or modifies the selection rule for the bound electron transition.</description>

      <title>Multi-photon Atom Interferometry via cavity-enhanced Bragg Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11693v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel atom interferometer configuration that combines large momentum transfer with the enhancement of an optical resonator for the purpose of measuring gravitational strain in the horizontal directions. Using Bragg diffraction and taking advantage of the optical gain provided by the resonator, we achieve momentum transfer up to $8\hbar k$ with mW level optical power in a cm-sized resonating waist. Importantly, our experiment uses an original resonator design that allows for a large resonating beam waist and eliminates the need to trap atoms in cavity modes. We demonstrate inertial sensitivity in the horizontal direction by measuring the change in tilt of our resonator. This result paves the way for future hybrid atom/optical gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, the versatility of our method extends to a wide range of measurement geometries and atomic sources, opening up new avenues for the realization of highly sensitive inertial atom sensors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Wide Dual-band Rydberg Atomic Receiver Based on Space Division Multiplexing RF-Chip Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting microwave signals over a wide frequency range has numerous advantages as it enables simultaneous transmission of a large amount of information and access to more spectrum resources. This capability is crucial for applications such as microwave communication, remote sensing, and radar. However, conventional microwave receiving systems are limited by amplifiers and band-pass filters that can only operate efficiently in a specific frequency range. Typically, these systems can only process signals within a three-fold frequency range, which limits the data transfer bandwidth of the microwave communication systems. Developing novel atom-integrated microwave sensors, for example, radio frequency (RF)-chip coupled Rydberg atomic receiver, provides opportunities for a large working bandwidth of microwave sensing at the atomic level. Here, an ultra-wide dual-band RF sensing scheme is demonstrated by space-division multiplexing two RF-chip-integrated atomic receiver modules. The system can simultaneously receive dual-band microwave signals that span a frequency range exceeding 6 octaves (300 MHz and 24 GHz). This work paves the way for multi-band microwave reception applications within an ultra-wide range by RF-chip-integrated Rydberg atomic sensor.</description>
