      <title>Optimal Transport-Based Generative Models for Bayesian Posterior Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of sampling from posterior distributions with intractable normalizing constants in Bayesian inference. Our solution is a new generative modeling approach based on optimal transport (OT) that learns a deterministic map from a reference distribution to the target posterior through constrained optimization. The method uses structural constraints from OT theory to ensure uniqueness of the solution and allows efficient generation of many independent, high-quality posterior samples. The framework supports both continuous and mixed discrete-continuous parameter spaces, with specific adaptations for latent variable models and near-Gaussian posteriors. Beyond computational benefits, it also enables new inferential tools based on OT-derived multivariate ranks and quantiles for Bayesian exploratory analysis and visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through multiple simulation studies and a real-world data analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Bayesian changepoint detection for network Poisson processes with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network point processes often exhibit latent structure that govern the behaviour of the sub-processes. It is not always reasonable to assume that this latent structure is static, and detecting when and how this driving structure changes is often of interest. In this paper, we introduce a novel online methodology for detecting changes within the latent structure of a network point process. We focus on block-homogeneous Poisson processes, where latent node memberships determine the rates of the edge processes. We propose a scalable variational procedure which can be applied on large networks in an online fashion via a Bayesian forgetting factor applied to sequential variational approximations to the posterior distribution. The proposed framework is tested on simulated and real-world data, and it rapidly and accurately detects changes to the latent edge process rates, and to the latent node group memberships, both in an online manner. In particular, in an application on the Santander Cycles bike-sharing network in central London, we detect changes within the network related to holiday periods and lockdown restrictions between 2019 and 2020.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Level Adapted Estimation of Marginal Likelihood for Bayesian Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In computational mechanics, multiple models are often present to describe a physical system. While Bayesian model selection is a helpful tool to compare these models using measurement data, it requires the computationally expensive estimation of a multidimensional integral -- known as the marginal likelihood or as the model evidence (\textit{i.e.}, the probability of observing the measured data given the model). This study presents efficient approaches for estimating this marginal likelihood by transforming it into a one-dimensional integral that is subsequently evaluated using a quadrature rule at multiple adaptively-chosen iso-likelihood contour levels. Three different algorithms are proposed to estimate the probability mass at each adapted likelihood level using samples from importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, respectively. The proposed approach is illustrated through four numerical examples. The first example validates the algorithms against a known exact marginal likelihood. The second example uses an 11-story building subjected to an earthquake excitation with an uncertain hysteretic base isolation layer with two models to describe the isolation layer behavior. The third example considers flow past a cylinder when the inlet velocity is uncertain. Based on these examples, the method with stratified sampling is by far the most accurate and efficient method for complex model behavior in low dimension. In the fourth example, the proposed approach is applied to heat conduction in an inhomogeneous plate with uncertain thermal conductivity modeled through a 100 degree-of-freedom Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion. The results indicate that MultiNest cannot efficiently handle the high-dimensional parameter space, whereas the proposed MCMC-based method more accurately and efficiently explores the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in Bayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.</description>
