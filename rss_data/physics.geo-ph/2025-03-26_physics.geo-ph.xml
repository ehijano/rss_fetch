      <title>Stochastic ecohydrological perspective on semi-distributed rainfall-runoff dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying watershed process variability consistently with climate change and ecohydrological dynamics remains a central challenge in hydrology. Stochastic ecohydrology characterizes hydrologic variability through probability distributions that link climate, hydrology, and ecology. However, these approaches are often limited to small spatial scales (e.g., point or plot level) or focus on specific fluxes (e.g., streamflow), without accounting for the entire water balance at the basin scale. While semi-distributed models account for spatial heterogeneity and upscaled hydrologic fluxes, they lack the analytical simplicity of stochastic ecohydrology or the SCS-CN method and, perhaps more importantly, do not integrate the effects of past random variability in hydroclimatic conditions. This hinders an efficient characterization of hydrological statistics at the watershed scale. To overcome these limitations, we merge stochastic ecohydrology, the spatial upscaling of semi-distributed modeling, and the SCS-CN rainfall-runoff partitioning. The resulting unified model analytically characterizes watershed ecohydrological and hydrological statistics using probability density functions (PDFs) that are functions of climate and watershed attributes -- something unattainable with the Monte Carlo methods of traditional stochastic hydrology. Calibrated across 81 watersheds in Florida and southern Louisiana, the model PDFs precisely capture the long-term average water balance and runoff variance, as well as the runoff quantiles with a median normalized Nash-Sutcliffe (NNSE) efficiency of 0.95. These results also advance the SCS-CN method by providing an analytical PDF for the Curve Number (CN), explicitly linked to climate variables, baseflow, and the long-term water balance partitioning described by the Budyko curve.</description>

      <title>Towards Long-Range ENSO Prediction with an Explainable Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a prominent mode of interannual climate variability with far-reaching global impacts. Its evolution is governed by intricate air-sea interactions, posing significant challenges for long-term prediction. In this study, we introduce CTEFNet, a multivariate deep learning model that synergizes convolutional neural networks and transformers to enhance ENSO forecasting. By integrating multiple oceanic and atmospheric predictors, CTEFNet extends the effective forecast lead time to 20 months while mitigating the impact of the spring predictability barrier, outperforming both dynamical models and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Furthermore, CTEFNet offers physically meaningful and statistically significant insights through gradient-based sensitivity analysis, revealing the key precursor signals that govern ENSO dynamics, which align with well-established theories and reveal new insights about inter-basin interactions among the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. The CTEFNet's superior predictive skill and interpretable sensitivity assessments underscore its potential for advancing climate prediction. Our findings highlight the importance of multivariate coupling in ENSO evolution and demonstrate the promise of deep learning in capturing complex climate dynamics with enhanced interpretability.</description>

      <title>Along-trajectory acoustic signal variations observed during the hypersonic reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reentry of the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule (SRC) on September 24, 2023, presented a rare opportunity to study atmospheric entry dynamics through a dense network of ground-based infrasound sensors. As the first interplanetary capsule to reenter over the United States since Stardust in 2006, this event allowed for unprecedented observations of infrasound signals generated during hypersonic descent. We deployed 39 single-sensor stations across Nevada and Utah, strategically distributed to capture signals from distinct trajectory points. Infrasound data were analyzed to examine how signal amplitude and period vary with altitude and propagation path for a non-ablating hypersonic object with well-defined physical and aerodynamic properties. Raytracing simulations incorporated atmospheric specifications from the Ground-2-Space model to estimate source altitudes for observed signals. Results confirmed ballistic arrivals at all stations, with source altitudes ranging from 44 km to 62 km along the trajectory. Signal period and amplitude exhibited strong dependence on source altitude, with higher altitudes corresponding to lower amplitudes, longer periods, and reduced high-frequency content. Regression analysis demonstrated strong correlations between signal characteristics and both altitude and propagation geometry. Our results suggest, when attenuation is considered, the amplitude is primarily determined by the source, with the propagation path playing a secondary role over the distances examined. These findings emphasize the utility of controlled SRC reentries for advancing our understanding of natural meteoroid dynamics, refining atmospheric entry models, and improving methodologies for planetary defense.</description>

      <title>Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks</title>

Abstract: The analysis of urban seismic signals offers valuable insights into urban environments and society. Yet, accurate detection and localization of seismic sources on a city-wide scale with conventional seismographic network is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies over time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array, we generate spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities, such as traffic, construction, and school operations. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and environmental noise levels, as well as various persistent urban features, including land use patterns and demographics.</description>

      <title>An experiment to observe GNSS signals with the Australian VGOS array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>Investigating the relationship between bolide entry angle and apparent direction of infrasound signal arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrasound sensing offers critical capabilities for detecting and geolocating bolide events globally. However, the observed back azimuths, directions from which infrasound signals arrive at stations, often differ from the theoretical expectations based on the bolide's peak brightness location. For objects with shallow entry angles, which traverse longer atmospheric paths, acoustic energy may be emitted from multiple points along the trajectory, leading to substantial variability in back azimuth residuals. This study investigates how the entry angle of energetic bolides affects the back azimuth deviations, independent of extrinsic factors such as atmospheric propagation, station noise, and signal processing methodologies. A theoretical framework, the Bolide Infrasound Back-Azimuth EXplorer Model (BIBEX-M), was developed to compute predicted back azimuths solely from geometric considerations. The model quantifies how these residuals vary as a function of source-to-receiver distance, revealing that bolides entering at shallow angles of 10 degrees can experience average residuals of 20 degrees, with deviations reaching up to 46 degrees at distances below 1000 km, and remaining significant even at 10,000 km. In contrast, bolides with steeper entry angles (greater than 60 degrees) show much smaller deviations, typically under 5 degrees at 1000 km and diminishing to less than 1 deg beyond 5000 km. These findings attest to the need for careful interpretation when evaluating signal detections and estimating bolide locations. This work is not only pertinent to bolides but also to other high-energy, extended-duration atmospheric phenomena such as space debris and reentry events, where similar geometric considerations can influence infrasound arrival directions.</description>
