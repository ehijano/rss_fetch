      <title>Soft background fields at next-to-leading power in transverse momentum dependent SIDIS with jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a factorization formula for the $e + h \rightarrow e + \text{jet} + X$ cross section at small transverse momenta up to next-to-leading power (NLP), derived using the background field method (BFM) with explicit inclusion of soft modes. We discuss the relation between soft modes and overlap subtractions at NLP, showing that the inclusion of soft modes enables a definition of twist-3 operators with properly subtracted rapidity and endpoint divergences. We also derive the effective current operator at NLP and identify additional structures compared to previous approaches based on soft-collinear effective theory and the BFM without soft modes. Nevertheless, for the hadronic tensor, we find agreement at the perturbative order that we are working at, and identify a condition that needs to be satisfied for this agreement to extend to higher orders. Furthermore, we construct the most general form factors for this process, taking into account the polarization of the initial states. These involve perturbatively-calculable jet functions, opening a path to precise determinations of twist-3 hadronic distributions. Finally, our formalism is illustrated with phenomenological results for a specific azimuthal asymmetry, whose leading-logarithmic contribution depends solely on a twist-3 hadronic distribution and a twist-2 jet function.</description>

      <title>Cornering Natural SUSY at a Tera-$Z$ Factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future circular $e^+ e^-$ collider (FCC-ee) stands out as the next flagship project in particle physics, dedicated to uncovering the microscopic origin of the Higgs boson. In this context, we assess indirect probes of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), a well-established benchmark hypothesis, exploring the complementarity between Higgs measurements and electroweak precision tests at the $Z$-pole. We study three key sectors: the heavy Higgs doublet, scalar top partners, and light gauginos and higgsinos, focusing on the parameter space favored by naturalness. Remarkably, the Tera-$Z$ program consistently offers significantly greater indirect sensitivity than the Mega-$h$ run. While promising, these prospects hinge on reducing SM uncertainties. Accordingly, we highlight key precision observables for targeted theoretical work.</description>

      <title>Scattering off unstable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unstable states that live long enough may appear as in(out)going particles in scattering experiments. Yet, the standard QFT approach strictly applies only to fully stable asymptotic states. This is evident when scattering involving unstable particles develops a $t$-channel singularity at specific angles. We employ a finite-time formalism leading to analytic results without the singularity (even in the infinite-time limit), thus solving the problem at a fundamental level. In turn, the approach also justifies treating long-lived particles, like weakly decaying pions, as stable during strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Axion with Nonrelativistic Momenta: A Robust Bound on Minimal ALP Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The axion-like particle (ALP), a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson that couples to two photons, has been studied extensively in recent years as a dark matter candidate. For initial field configurations in a minimal ALP model explaining the observed dark matter abundance, we need the potential height to exceed the ALP energy density at redshift $z\approx 5.5\times 10^{6}$ leading to: $$
  f_{\phi}\gtrsim4\times10^{13}\,{GeV}\,\biggl(\frac{10^{-18}\,eV}{m_{\phi}}\biggr), $$ where $m_{\phi}$ and $f_{\phi}$ denote the ALP mass and decay constant, respectively. This bound is known for the ALP dark matter dominated by the homogeneous zero-momentum mode, under the requirement that coherent oscillations begin early enough to satisfy the late-forming dark matter constraint. One loop hole to evade this limit may be to introduce a large amount of the non-relativistic modes of the ALP with non-vanishing momenta. Here we show that the same limit remains valid even if nonzero-momentum modes dominate. Interestingly, when $nonrelativistic$ gradient modes prevail, the ALP behaves $relativistic$ radiation rather than matter, if it violates the limit. Moreover, if the typical momentum is sufficiently small, domain walls form.</description>

      <title>Improving Sensitivity of Vector-like Top Partner Searches with Jet Substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector-like quark partners appear in many BSM models and remain an important area of research, as they can offer insights into the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. In this work, we have focused on studying the production of a heavy vector-like top partner in association with a SM top quark via chromomagnetic coupling and the four decay modes of the top partner, namely, $bW$, $tZ$, $th$, and $tg$. The signal has been studied in final states with one fat jet, at least one $b$-tagged jet, one lepton, and missing energy. This study focuses on the extensive use of jet substructure techniques in jets clustered with fixed and dynamically varying radius to deal with events containing differently sized jets. Important kinematic information, along with jet substructure and event shape observables, has been used in a multivariate analysis to extract signal with high significance. A comparative study between fixed and dynamically varying radius clustering of jets is also presented, leading to an improvement in signal sensitivity in the highly boosted scenario.</description>

      <title>Cornering CP4 3HDM via top quark decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP4 3HDM is a peculiar three-Higgs-doublet model in which a single symmetry leads to tight constraints on the scalar and Yukawa sectors. In this models, tree-level flavor-changing neutral couplings are unavoidable; however, as previously shown, their contributions to neutral meson oscillations can be suppressed. Here, we explore the remaining quark flavor violating effects, which give rise to the top quark decays to light scalars, including the 125 GeV Higgs boson $h_{SM}$, as well as the magnitude of the $h_{SM} t\bar t$ coupling. Utilizing the recently developed scanning procedure, in which observables are used as input, we narrow down the viable options to a unique CP4-invariant Yukawa sector capable of satisfying all meson oscillation and top quark constraints. We present benchmark models that feature neutral or charged Higgs bosons lighter than the top quark, and we look forward to testing them further at the LHC and through flavor physics observables.</description>

      <title>$M1$ Radiative Transition of Light Mesons in the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $M1$ radiative transitions between light vector $\mathcal{V}$ and pseudoscalar $\mathcal{P}$ mesons in the 1S and 2S states in the light-front quark model. To this end, we use the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) obtained from the QCD-motivated effective Hamiltonian that includes smeared spin-spin interactions, where a few harmonic oscillator basis functions were employed as trial wave functions. The results, including their couplings and widths, obtained from LFWFs with different trial wave functions are compared with the available experimental data and other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Constraining the axiverse with reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions that couple to electromagnetism are produced in the early Universe by, among other channels, freeze-in via the Primakoff process. For sufficiently large axion masses, the same coupling causes the axions to decay into two photons, which subsequently ionize the intergalactic medium. If this decay occurs in the redshift range $20 \lesssim z \lesssim 1100$, then the contribution to the cosmic microwave background optical depth $\tau_{\rm reio}$ can lead to a conflict with observations, excluding models with sufficiently strongly coupled, heavy axions and high reheating temperatures, $T_{\rm reh}$. Using large ensembles of explicit type IIB string theory models with up to $h^{1,1} = 100$ axions, we compute the full cosmic reionization history caused by the decays of multiple axions. We compare this to the posterior on the high-$z$ component of $\tau_{\rm reio}$ derived from model-independent constraints on the ionization state of the Universe, obtained in a full \textit{Planck} analysis presented in a companion paper. For $h^{1,1} = 20, 50, 100$, we find that approximately 15\%, 15\%, and 10\% of the models in the ensemble prefer $T_{\rm reh} \lesssim 10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$ at 95\% CL. We provide a publicly available code at:~\href{https://github.com/ZiwenYin/Reionization-with-multi-axions-decay}{github.com/ZiwenYin/Reionization-with-multi-axions-decay}, which computes the reionization history for arbitrary ensembles of decaying axions. Our analysis opens the door for future large-scale work studying the preference for low-temperature reheating in models with multiple axions.</description>

      <title>Challenging $\bar{B}_{(s)}\to D_{(s)}^{(*)}$ Form Factors with the Heavy Quark Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent publications by three lattice QCD collaborations have provided an unprecedented wealth of theoretical predictions for the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors, for spectator flavours $q=u/d$ and $q=s$. We analyse these predictions within the framework of the heavy-quark expansion (HQE) to order $\alpha_s$, $1/m_b$, and $1/m_c^2$. For the first time, our analysis imposes unitarity bounds for all of the $\bar{B}_q^{(*)} \to D_q^{(*)}$ form factors; this includes newly identified tensor form factors arising in $\bar{B}_q^*\to D_q^{(*)}$. This enables us to treat all form factors in the same fashion. At the level of our present analysis, the inclusion of the tensor bounds is not yet constraining the HQE parameter space. We find the lattice QCD results to be well compatible with each other in a joint HQE fit as well as with QCD sum rule estimates that were used in previous HQE analyses. This is in contrast to the strong variability of the posterior predictions, in particular of the form factors ratios $R_0$ and $R_2$. Using the posterior distributions of our HQE analysis, we provide predictions for angular observables and LFU ratios in the $\bar{B}_q \to D_q^{(*)}\ell^-\bar{\nu}$ decays.</description>

      <title>Rotational susceptibility of a hot and dense hadronic matter: A possible probe of QCD phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation and the consequent angular momentum fluctuations in a hadron resonance gas produced in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions. The rotational susceptibilities ($\chi_{\rm \omega}$, $\chi^{2}_{\rm \omega}$, etc.), which quantify how much the system responds to a small angular velocity, are estimated for the first time, considering that these can be valuable indicators of the QCD phase transition. The higher-order rotational susceptibilities and their ratios are estimated in the presence and absence of baryon chemical potential ($\mu_{\rm B}$) in the system. The effect of particle spin ($s$) and rotational chemical potential ($\omega$) on the fluctuation of the angular momentum is studied. To consider a more realistic scenario, the effect of interactions between hadrons is taken into account by considering van der Waals-like interactions, which include both attractive and repulsive interactions. A phase transition, absent in an ideal hadron gas model, can be observed in an interacting hadron gas model.</description>

      <title>Post-Sphaleron Darkogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A supercooled phase transition in a nearly conformal dark sector can provide a natural setting for darkogenesis via its out-of-equilibrium dynamics, where a particle-antiparticle number asymmetry in the dark sector can be reprocessed into the visible sector, yielding the observed baryon asymmetry and an asymmetric dark matter. We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark bubble cosmology and the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of string phenomenology is to find realistic models of particle physics and cosmology within string theory. Dark bubble cosmology is an alternative to string compactifications, where our universe lives on a bubble expanding in a higher-dimensional spacetime. This construction is inherently non-supersymmetric and can yield a four-dimensional realistic cosmology, where radiation behaves as expected due to its coupling to higher-dimensional fields. We study the coupling of the electroweak and strong sectors to the induced braneworld gravity via the same mechanism. While the electroweak sector is unaffected, the gravitational and inertial masses of the proton differ significantly, severely violating measurements of the equivalence principle.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass generation via the inverse seesaw mechanism in a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present anomaly-free solutions suitable for an inverse seesaw realization within a $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension. Implementing such a mechanism, in a phenomenologically viable way, requires the inclusion of at least four exotic fermions, assumed to be Standard Model singlets. In order to build anomaly-free models, the $B-L$ charges of these exotic fermions must satisfy two constraint equations, known as the anomaly equations. Here, we focus on solutions involving four to eight new right-handed fermions, favoring cases where all the $B-L$ charges of these fermions are rational numbers. We showed that, when considering only the right-handed fermions necessary to realize the mechanism, the solutions must have irrational charge values. By adding one more exotic singlet fermion, which does not directly enter the mechanism mass matrix, it becomes possible to find solutions with rational charges, while the addition of a second one enables a reduction of the scalar sector. On top of the two anomaly equations, a set of inequalities and additional constraint equations were added to correctly account for neutrino masses and to minimize the scalar content. So here we present sets of charges that obey the anomaly equations as well as these additional constraints. Finally, we explore the phenomenological implications of such solutions by analyzing their capacity to provide a framework for dark matter candidates, choosing one particular solution as an example.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way is a Laboratory for New Ultra-long-baseline Neutrino Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory recently published evidence for diffuse neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane at $4.5\sigma$ significance. This new source of astrophysical neutrinos provides an exciting laboratory for probing the nature of neutrino masses. In particular, extremely small mass splittings, such as those predicted by quasi-Dirac neutrino mass models, and finite neutrino lifetimes from neutrino decays, would induce effects on the spectra and flavor ratios of neutrinos with TeV-scale energies traversing kiloparsec-scale baselines. Using $\mathtt{TANDEM}$, an upcoming three dimensional galactic neutrino emission model, we explore the sensitivity of IceCube and KM3NeT/ARCA to these ultra-long-baseline phenomena. We find that a combined analysis would be sensitive to quasi-Dirac mass splittings $10^{-14.0}~\mathrm{eV^2} \lesssim \delta m^2 \lesssim 10^{11.6}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ and neutrino lifetimes $m / \tau \gtrsim 10^{-14.1}~\mathrm{eV^2}$ at $&gt; 1\sigma$, both regions constituting as-yet unexplored parameter space. Our results demonstrate the potential that astrophysical neutrino sources and global neutrino telescope networks have in probing new regions of exotic neutrino mass models.</description>

Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of the model in separating signal from relevant Standard Model backgrounds in the context of Flavour-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) top-quark couplings, focusing on the rare decay process $t \rightarrow uZ$. The study is performed at three collider setups: the approved High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), the proposed High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC), and the Future Circular Collider in hadron-hadron mode (FCC-hh). We train the o3 model on detector level data for signal and background processes to predict selection cuts that enhance Signal-to-Background (S/B) discrimination. A comparative analysis is then carried out between the efficiencies resulting from o3-predicted cuts and those derived from traditional manually designed strategies used by a control group. Our results demonstrate that the o3 model performs on par with traditional methods in terms of S/B separation, with a slight improvement in the case of FCC-hh, suggesting its promise as a fast and generalizable tool for new physics searches.</description>

      <title>The nano-hertz and milli-hertz stochastic gravitational waves in the minimal clockwork axion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clockwork framework can realize TeV-scale $U(1)_{PQ}$ symmetry breaking while generating a large axion decay constant \(f_a\). We propose a minimal clockwork axion model with three scalar fields, in which two domain walls (DWs) have non-zero tension. The DW associated with one of the fields is formed following the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry breaking and subsequently collapses due to the potential bias induced by the QCD instanton. The nano-hertz stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) generated from this DW annihilation can be probed by Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments. In addition, the DW related to the other field is annihilated by a bias potential originating from higher-dimensional operators, producing a significant GW signal with a peak frequency around \(9.41\times10^{-5}\) Hz, which can be detected by the LISA, Taiji, and TianQin experiments. Constraints on the model from SN1987, dark matter overproduction, Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, and primordial black holes have been considered. The relic density of QCD axion dark matter can be explained through the misalignment mechanism.</description>

      <title>From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Revisit the diquark of $\Lambda_c$ in the $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda K^+$ and $\Lambda_c\to \Sigma^0 K^+$ processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distributions of $[ud]$ diquark and heavy-light diquark of the SU(3)-flavor antitriplet charmed baryons are investigated by the two singly Cabibbo-suppressed hadronic weak decays, $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda K^+$ and $\Lambda_c\to \Sigma^0 K^+$ within the nonrelativistic constituent quark model. The above two spatial distributions are reflected by the two parameters $\alpha_\rho$ and $\alpha_\lambda$, which are the harmonic oscillator strength parameters of the charmed baryons. These two parameters obtain strong constraints from the decay widths of $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda K^+$ and $\Lambda_c\to \Sigma^0 K^+$. The larger the harmonic oscillator parameter is, the more compact the spatial distribution will become. The current $\alpha_\rho$ and $\alpha_\lambda$ indicate that neither the light diquark nor the heavy-light diquark turns out to favor a compact structure. In addition, some selection rules, including the ``$\Lambda$ selection rule'', can be useful for the search of excited baryons in the heavy-flavor baryon hadronic weak decays.</description>

      <title>Comparison of chiral limit studies in curvature mass versus on-shell renormalized quark-meson model using ChPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent chiral limit has been investigated in the curvature mass parametrized quark-meson (QM) model with the quark one-loop vacuum term (QMVT) employing the infrared regularized Chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predicted scaling of the pion,~kaon decay constants $f_{\pi}, f_{K} $ and $M_{\eta}^2 = m_{\eta}^2 + m_{\eta^{\prime}}^2 $ when the $\pi \ \text{and} \ K $ meson masses are reduced as one moves away from the physical point in the Columbia plot.~Comparing the QMVT model Columbia plots with the corresponding Columbia plots computed,~in the very recent work of Ref.~\cite{vkt25} using the on-shell renormalized QM (RQM) model and the earlier work of Ref.~\cite{Resch} using functional renormalization group techniques in the extended mean field approximation of QM (e-MFA:QM-FRG) model,~it has been estimated how the first, second and crossover chiral transition regions in the $m_{\pi}-m_{K}$($m_{ud}-m_{s}$) and the $\mu-m_{K}$($\mu-m_{s}$) planes,~get modified by different methods of implementing the quark one-loop vacuum fluctuations in the QM model.~Since both the e-MFA:QM-FRG and the QMVT model,~use curvature meson masses to fix the parameters and the dimensional regularization of vacuum divergences are incorporated equivalently,~the differences in their results can be attributed to different methods of approaching the chiral limit.</description>

      <title>Probing maximal flavor changing $Z'$ in $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ at $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential to detect the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model featuring triplet scalars $\Delta$ at the $\mu$TRISTAN collider. The new gauge boson $Z'$, arising from the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$, can exhibit maximal flavor changing interactions under the exchange symmetry, while $\Delta$ mediates the flavor conserving interactions. The absence of muon $(g-2)_\mu$ can be explained by interference effects arising from opposite contributions of $Z'$ and $\Delta$, with similar interference patterns also manifesting in the tau decay process $\tau\to \mu\nu\bar\nu$. These counteracting effects render the model phenomenologically interesting and warrant further investigation. For the mass $m_{Z'}$ in the range of hundreds of GeV, we find that $\mu^+\mu^+$ and $\mu^+e^-$ collider at the $\mu$TRISTAN
  can probe many regions inaccessible to current experiments and offer greater projected sensitivity than opposite-sign muon colliders. This suggests that $\mu$TRISTAN can serve as complementary exploration to the $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model, providing compelling motivation for the next generation of high-energy lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>A Rephasing Invariant Formula for the Dirac CP Phase and its Perturbative Expansion: Prospects for DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formula for the Dirac CP phase $\delta = \arg ( U_{e1} U_{e2} U_{\mu 3} U_{\tau 3} / U_{e3} \det U_{\rm MNS} )$, directly derived from the lepton mixing matrix in an arbitrary basis. In contrast to the numerically suppressed Jarlskog invariant, this expression is computationally simple and less sensitive to approximations. We apply the formula to derive perturbative corrections from charged-lepton mixing $s_{ij}^{e}$ to the underlying CP phase of neutrinos $\delta_{\nu}$. A compact analytic expressions $\delta = \delta_{\nu} + s_{12}^{e} D_{12} + s_{13}^{e} D_{13} + s_{23}^{e} D_{23}$ shows that these corrections can substantially exceed $O(10^{\circ})$, potentially within the reach of future long-baseline experiments such as DUNE and T2HK.</description>

      <title>Entropy from decoherence: a case study using glasma-based occupation numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the entropy-per-particle, $S/N$, produced by the decoherence of a coherent state interacting with an environment, using an analytical open quantum system approach. The coherent state considered is characterized by occupation numbers borrowed from the glasma fields produced in the early stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. The environment is modeled as the vacuum, and decoherence arises from the interaction of the state with vacuum fluctuations. We describe the system-environment interaction via a phase-damping model, which represents continuous measurements on the system without altering its energy or particle number. Starting from the occupation numbers typical of the Glasma in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, we find that the final $S/N$ after decoherence is lower than that of a two-dimensional thermal bath of ultrarelativistic gluons, except for proton-nucleus collisions at small values of $g\mu$. Our results indicate that quantum decoherence alone does not generate sufficient entropy to transform the initial coherent state into a thermalized gluon bath.</description>

      <title>Cross section of the process $e^+ + e^- \to \Xi^0 + \bar{\Xi}^0$ including three-gluon and $D$-meson loop contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of a $\Xi^0 \bar{\Xi}^0$ using $e^+e^-$ collision data at ten center-of-mass energies between 3.51 and 4.95 GeV collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 30 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ to study the structure of baryons. The data collected by the BESIII detector are useful for the study of XYZ states, and this collaboration continues the exploration of these exotic charmonium-like states. We explore a hyperon pair produced in the electron-positron annihilation reactions. In the present paper we present the phenomenological results of our studies on the production of $\Xi^0 \bar{\Xi}^0$ in $e^+e^-$ annihilation at the BESIII detector at the BEPCII Collider. In the reaction $e^+e^- \to \Xi^0 \bar{\Xi}^0$, we consider two different contributions: one from the $D$ meson loop and the ofther from the three-gluon charmonium annihilation. We compute the total cross section of the process $e^+e^- \to \Xi^0 \bar{\Xi}^0$ including the contributions of the $D$-meson loop and three-gluon loops as well as the interference of all diagrams. As for the purely electromagnetic mechanism, large relative phases are generated for these contributions. For a large momentum transferred region we get as a byproduct a fit of the electromagnetic form factor of the $\Xi^0$ - hyperon. In this paper, in addition to the $\psi(3770)$ charmonium, we also take into account the contributions of other charmonium (-like) states, such as $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$, $Y(4230)$, $Y(4360)$, $\psi(4415)$, and $Y(4660)$. On the whole our results are in good agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Modelling top-quark decays in $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the fixed-order NLO QCD predictions for the $pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}+X$ process in the $4\ell$ decay channel with the parton-shower based results obtained with the POWHEG and MC@NLO matching methods. In the first case, NLO QCD corrections are consistently included in both the $t\bar{t}t\bar{t}$ production step and the decays of the four top quarks, preserving all spin correlations. In the second approach, higher-order effects in top-quark decays with approximate spin correlations are simulated in the PYTHIA parton-shower framework. Additionally, we analyse the impact of including the so-called matrix element corrections in top-quark decays in both parton-shower matched predictions. The comparison is performed at the integrated and differential fiducial cross-section level for the LHC centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=13.6$ TeV.</description>

      <title>More visualisation of decay-time-dependent asymmetries in multibody B-meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods have been proposed recently to weight data in order to allow visualisation of CP-violation effects in transitions of neutral B mesons to multibody final states that are not CP-eigenstates. These are useful since integration of the unweighted data over the phase space would otherwise wash out the effects of interest. A similar method, elaborated upon here, with a different weighting function can also be used to visualise CP-conserving $B_{(s)}^0$--$\overline{B}{}_{(s)}^0$ oscillations, rather than the CP-violating asymmetries. Together with the other weighting functions, this new method could be useful, for example, to demonstrate the accuracy of the calibration of the flavour tagging algorithms that are crucial for analyses such as the measurement of the CP-violating phase in $B_s^0 \to J/\!\psi\phi$ decays. Their application to the formalism in common use for such decays is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Effect of Off-diagonal NSI Parameters on Entanglement Measurements in Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of off-diagonal non-standard interaction (NSI) parameters on quantum entanglement within the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework. By expressing three key entanglement measures: Entanglement of Formation (EOF), Concurrence, and Negativity in terms of oscillation probabilities, we analyze how these quantum correlations are affected by the NSI parameters $\epsilon_{e\mu}$, $\epsilon_{e\tau}$, and $\epsilon_{\mu\tau}$, including their complex phases. Using the DUNE experiment as a benchmark, we find that NSI effects are most significant at low energies, with Negativity showing the highest sensitivity even at high energies. It is observed that $\epsilon_{e \mu}$ and $\epsilon_{e \tau}$ affect entanglement measures mainly through the appearance channel, while the impact of $\epsilon_{\mu \tau}$ on EOF, Concurrence, and Negativity is predominantly linked to the disappearance channel.</description>

      <title>Eta Fragmentation Functions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of parton-to-eta meson fragmentation functions at next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD in the light of the recent hadroproduction measurements in proton-proton collisions obtained by the PHENIX, LHCb, and ALICE collaborations. In addition to an increased precision, the data explore complementary rapidity ranges and center-of-mass system energies. The analysis exploits the theoretical scale dependence to ease tensions among the data sets at different energies that are potentially caused by QCD corrections beyond the next-to-leading order. The resulting set of fragmentation functions yields a consistent description of all available data. Estimates of uncertainties are obtained with the Monte Carlo replica method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief review on the spin alignment induced by the strong field and the shear-stress tensor. In experiments, a significant positive deviation from 1/3 is observed for the $\phi$ meson, which can be explained by the anisotropy of the strong field fluctuation in the meson's rest frame, while the anisotropy is mainly a consequence of the motion of meson relative to the quark-gluon plasma. On the other hand, the shear-induced spin alignment is of the order $10^{-4}\sim10^{-5}$ if the magnitude of thermal shear tensor is $10^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Weak decays of $B_s$ meson in self-consistent covariant light-front approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of weak transition form factors and decay observables of the $B_s$ meson in transitions to pseudoscalar ($P$) and vector ($V$) mesons. The $B_s \to P(V)$ form factors are calculated using the self-consistent covariant light-front quark model, with a model-independent $z$-series expansion calibrated to lattice QCD and phenomenological inputs for quark masses and $\beta$ parameters. This enables reliable $q^2$-resolved predictions across the full kinematic range. Based on these form factors, we predict branching ratios and angular observables, including forward-backward asymmetries, polarization fractions, and leptonic convexity parameters for semileptonic decays. Nonleptonic two-body decay rates for $B_s \to PP$ and $B_s \to PV$ modes are also computed within the standard factorization framework using the same dynamical input. Comparisons with results from lattice QCD, light-cone sum rules, and other approaches are presented, highlighting both theoretical consistency and persistent tensions with experiment.</description>

      <title>Recasting Experimental Constraints on Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for $e/\pi^0$ Particle Classification in LArTPC Neutrino Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient classification of electromagnetic activity from $\pi^0$ and electrons remains an open problem in the reconstruction of neutrino interactions in Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detectors. We address this problem using the mathematical framework of Optimal Transport (OT), which has been successfully employed for event classification in other HEP contexts and is ideally suited to the high-resolution calorimetry of LArTPCs. Using a publicly available simulated dataset from the MicroBooNE collaboration, we show that OT methods achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction performance in $e/\pi^0$ classification. The success of this first application indicates the broader promise of OT methods for LArTPC-based neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Reproducing Standard Model Fermion Masses and Mixing in String Theory: A Heterotic Line Bundle Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deriving the Yukawa couplings and the resulting fermion masses and mixing angles of the Standard Model (SM) from a more fundamental theory remains one of the central outstanding problems in theoretical high-energy physics. It has long been recognised that string theory provides a framework within which this question can, at least in principle, be addressed. While substantial progress has been made in studying flavour physics in string compactifications over the past few decades, a concrete string construction that reproduces the full set of observed SM flavour parameters remains unknown. Here, we take a significant step in this direction by identifying two explicit $E_8 \times E_8$ heterotic string models compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold with abelian, holomorphic, and poly-stable vector bundles with an (MS)SM spectrum. Subject to reasonable assumptions about the moduli, we show that these models reproduce the correct values of the quark and charged lepton masses, as well as the quark mixing parameters, at some point in their moduli spaces. The resulting four-dimensional theories are $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric, contain no exotic fields and realise a $\mu$-term suppressed to the electroweak scale. While the issues of moduli stabilisation and supersymmetry breaking are not addressed here, our main result constitutes a proof of principle: there exist choices of topology and moduli within heterotic string compactifications which allow for an MSSM spectrum with the correct flavour parameters.</description>

      <title>Evolving Dark Sector and the Dark Dimension Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String theory naturally leads to the expectation that dark energy is not stable, and may be evolving as captured by the Swampland de Sitter conjectures. Moreover, motivated by the distance conjecture a unification of dark sector has been proposed, where the smallness of dark energy leads to one extra dimension of micron size with dark matter being the KK graviton excitations in this extra dimension. We consider the natural possibility that the radius of the dark dimension varies as the dark energy decreases, leading to the variation of the dark matter mass. This correlates the decrease of the dark energy with the variation of the dark matter mass as they depend on the variations of a scalar field $\phi$ controlling the radius of the extra dimension. A simple realization of this idea for small range of $\phi$ is captured by choosing a potential which is locally of the form $V=V_0\ {\rm exp}(-c\phi)$ and dark matter mass $m_{\rm DM}=m_0\ {\rm exp}(-c' \phi)$ where the sign of $\phi$ is chosen such that $c'\geq 0$ while we have two choices for the sign of $c$ depending on whether the dark dimension expands or shrinks when the dark energy dominates. We find excellent agreement with recent experimental data from DESI DR2 combined with SN measurements and reproduces the same significance as CPL parametrization with the added benefit of providing a natural explanation for the apparent phantom behavior ($w&lt;-1$) reported by DESI and DES based on a physical model. Regardless of the SN dataset, there is a preference for non-zero values of $c'$ and $c$ that are in the expected $O(1)$ range in Planck units as suggested by the Swampland criteria. In particular, there is a remarkable consistency with $c'\simeq 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for all dataset combinations including SN, and close to the experimental upper bound of $c'\lesssim 0.2$ demanded by the lack of detection of fifth force in the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and Model Independence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of evidence in favor of any new physics models means that the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) is wide open, with no direction clearly more promising than any other. This marks a turn towards what can be called `model-independent' methods-strategies that reduce the influence of modelling assumptions by performing minimally-biased precision measurements, using effective field theories, or using Deep Learning methods (DL). In this paper, I present the novel and promising uses of DL as a primary tool in high energy physics research, highlighting the use of autoencoder networks and unsupervised learning methods. I advocate for the importance and usefulness of the concept of model independence and propose a definition that recognizes that independence of models is not absolute, but comes in degrees.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features from heavy particle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <title>Experiment and the Pursuit of Ugly Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientists do not merely choose to accept fully formed theories, they also have to decide which models to work on before they are fully developed and tested. Since decisive empirical evidence in favour of a model will not yet have been gathered, other criteria must play determining roles. I examine the case of modern high-energy physics where the experimental context that once favoured the pursuit of beautiful, simple, and general theories now favours the pursuit of models that are ad hoc, narrow in scope, and complex; in short, ugly models. The lack of new discoveries since the Higgs boson, together with the lack of a new higher energy collider, has left searches for new physics conceptually and empirically wide open. Physicists must make use of the experiment at hand while also creatively exploring alternatives that have not yet been explored. This encourages the pursuit of models that have at least one of two key features: i) they take radically novel approaches, or ii) are easily testable. I present four cases, neutralino dark matter, the relaxion, repulsive gravity, and models of lepton flavour universality violation, and show that even if they do not exhibit traditional epistemic virtues, they are nonetheless pursuitworthy. I argue that experimental context strongly determines pursuitworthiness and I lay out the conditions under which experiment encourages the pursuit of ugly models.</description>

      <title>Do Anomalies Break Momentum Routing Invariance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diagrammatic computation of the chiral anomaly is associated with momentum-routing invariance breaking. This happens because the momentum routing in the internal lines of a loop diagram is chosen such that the gauge Ward identities hold and the chiral Ward identity is broken by the finite term measured in the pion decay into two photons. Since the latter is observable, it seems that there is a preferred momentum routing set by experiments. However, it is shown in this work that the chiral anomaly is momentum-routing invariant. This idea is specially important for situations in which there are no experiments yet to decide on the momentum routing, like in supersymmetric theories and in frameworks with CPT and Lorentz violation. Therefore, we resort to momentum-routing invariance to find out what symmetry is broken in a nonminimal CPT- and Lorentz-violating version of quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Independently from the formation mechanism of primordial black holes in the early universe, their generation is accompanied by a ringdown phase during which they relax to a stationary configuration and gravitational waves under the form of quasinormal modes are emitted. Such gravitational waves generate an irreducible and unavoidable stochastic background which is testable by current and future experiments. In particular, the presence of a primordial black hole ringdown allows to significantly constrain the idea of extremely supermassive black holes to comprise the entire dark matter of the universe.</description>

      <title>The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring ultra-high energy neutrinos, with energies above $10^{16}$ eV, is the next frontier of the emerging multi-messenger era. Their detection requires building a large-scale detector with 10 times the instantaneous sensitivity of current instruments, sub-degree angular resolution, and wide daily field of view. The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to be that discovery instrument. HERON combines the complementary features of two radio techniques being demonstrated by the BEACON and GRAND prototypes. Its preliminary design consists of 24 compact, elevated phased stations with 24 antennas each, embedded in a sparse array of 360 standalone antennas. This setup tunes the energy threshold to below 100 PeV, where the neutrino flux should be high. The sensitivity of the phased stations combines with the powerful reconstruction capacities of the standalone antennas to produce an optimal detector. HERON is planned to be installed at an elevation of 1,000 m across a 72 km-long mountain range overlooking a valley in Argentina's San Juan province. It would be connected to the worldwide network of multimessenger observatories and search for neutrino bursts from candidate sources of cosmic rays, like gamma-ray bursts and other powerful transients. With HERON's deep sensitivity, this strategy targets discoveries that cast new light into the inner workings of the most violent astrophysical sources at uncharted energies. We present the preliminary design, performances, and observation strategy of HERON.</description>

We compute their physical properties, including quantities associated with the circular geodesics of massless and massive particles, analyze their shadows and image features, and energy conditions.

      <title>Connecting the Quenched $g_A$ in Nuclear Matter To Dense Compact-Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An argument is developed that the long-standing mystery in nuclear physics of the effective axial-current coupling constant in nuclei, $g_A^{\rm eff}\approx 1$, could be understood in terms of the mechanism referred to as ``pseudo-conformal sound speed" in dense compact-star matter, $v_{\rm pcs}^2/c^2\approx 1/3$. Both pros and cons are presented using an effective field theory anchored on renormalization-group approach to interacting baryons on the Fermi surface that enables one to go beyond Weinberg's highly successful EFT $\chi$EFT$_\pi$ with the pion field only (in nuclear medium) by implementing heavy-meson degrees of freedom. Both hidden local symmetry and hidden scale symmetry, the former involving the vector mesons $\rho$ and $\omega$ and the latter involving the hidden scalar meson, a dilaton $\hat{\sigma}$ ($f_0(500)$), play the crucial role. Going beyond the density regime applicable to normal nuclear matter $n_0$, the notion of ``hadron-quark continuity" is brought in via the topological structure of the nucleon, i.e., skyrmion considered to be valid in QCD at large $N_c$ limit. The new inputs for the argumentation are the large N limit of the Grassmanian model for hidden local symmetry and the IR fixed point in QCD for $N_f \leq 3$ involving ``genuine/QCD-conformal dilaton" for hidden scale symmetry.</description>

      <title>Science of the LISA mission: A Summary for the European Strategy for Particle Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LISA mission is an international collaboration between ESA, its member states, and NASA, for the detection of gravitational waves from space. It was adopted in January 2024 and is scheduled for launch in the mid-2030's. It will be a constellation of three identical spacecraft forming a near-equilateral triangle in an heliocentric orbit, transferring laser beams over $2.5 \cdot 10^6$ km long arms. Laser interferometry is used to track separations between test masses, thus measuring spacetime strain variations as a function of time. LISA Science Objectives tackle many open questions in astrophysics, fundamental physics and cosmology, including ESA's Cosmic Vision questions "What are the fundamental laws of the universe?" and "How did the universe originate and of what is it made?". In this contribution, based on the LISA Red Book, we present a summary of the LISA Science Objectives relevant for the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Interacting Scalar Fields as Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it in the form of an autonomous system, and constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend. We also use the updated Roman mock high redshift data to further constrain the parameters of the two models.</description>

      <title>Extraction of ground-state nuclear deformations from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions: Nuclear structure physics context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We conclude that, on the whole, the discussion regarding low-energy nuclear physics is confusing and the suggested impact on nuclear structure research is overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical generation of scalar mass in two Higgs doublet model under Yukawa interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light scalars are among the expected particles in nature. If they indeed exist, dynamical generation of masses becomes an important phenomenon to investigate in scalar interactions. A two Higgs doublet model containing two complex doublet scalar fields, conveniently called the standard model Higgs and the second Higgs fields, is studied to explore the extent of dynamical mass generation and the field propagators in the model at different cutoff values. Both Higgs fields are coupled with each other by a real singlet scalar field through a modelled Yukawa interaction. The model is studied for various renormalized masses of the second Higgs field at various coupling strength. The renormalized mass of the standard model Higgs boson is kept at $125.09$ GeV. The model has strong indication of existence of critical coupling below $10^{-3}$ GeV. The observed dynamical masses are generally within $200$ MeV. The two Higgs propagators are found to be considerably stable compared to scalar singlet propagators despite cutoff effects. No phase structure in the parameter space was observed. The model is found non-trivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.08215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Simple Extension of the Standard Model (SESM), which can account for various tentative new physics anomalies and dark matter. The B physics anomalies, muon anomalous magnetic moment, and dark matter can be explained already in SESM. In this work, we study the unitarity constraint on this model and comment the parameter space on the edge of unitarity bounds. Besides, the complete scalar potential is considered which is needed to address the $W$ boson anomaly and more dark matter (co-)annihilation processes are discussed. We perform a systematic study, and find the viable parameter space which can explain these anomalies and evade all the current experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Dark matter freeze-in from non-equilibrium QFT: towards a consistent treatment of thermal effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermal corrections to a model of real scalar dark matter (DM) interacting feebly with a SM fermion and a gauge-charged vector-like fermion mediator. We employ the Closed-Time-Path (CTP) formalism for our calculation and go beyond previous works by including the full dependence on the relevant mass scales as opposed to using (non)relativistic approximations. In particular, we calculate the DM production rate by employing 1PI-resummed propagators constructed from the leading order term in the loop expansion of the 2PI effective action, beyond the Hard-Thermal-Loop (HTL) approximation. We compare our findings to commonly used approximation schemes, including solving the Boltzmann equation using momentum-independent thermal masses in decay processes and as regulators for $t$-channel divergences. We also compare with the result when employing HTL propagators and their tree-level limit. We find that the DM relic abundance when using thermal masses in the Boltzmann approach deviates between $-10\%$ and $+30\%$ from our calculation, where the size and sign strongly depend on the mass splitting between the DM candidate and the gauge-charged mediator. The HTL-approximated result is more accurate at small gauge couplings, only deviating by a few percent at large mass splittings, whereas it overestimates the relic density up to $25\%$ for small mass splittings. Calculations using tree-level propagators in the CTP formalism or semiclassical Boltzmann equations without scatterings underestimate the dark matter abundance and can lead to deviations of up to $-100\%$ from the 1PI-resummed result.</description>

      <title>Exploring Transport Properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma in Flavor-Dependent Systems with a Holographic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the holographic model, which incorporates the equation of state (EoS) and baryon number susceptibility for different flavors, we calculate the drag force, jet quenching parameter, and diffusion coefficient of the heavy quark at finite temperature and chemical potential. The holographic results for the diffusion coefficient align with lattice data for $N_f = 0$ and $N_f = 2+1$, falling within their error margins. The holographic diffusion coefficient for heavy quark in the systems of different flavors \textcolor{red}{is compatible with estimates from ALICE data.} The jet quenching parameter in our model demonstrates strong consistency \textcolor{red}{with the estimations obtained from Bayesian analysis of data from both RHIC and LHC for different flavors.} We can confirm the model provides a good description of the transport properties of QGP. The work reinforces the potential of bottom-up holographic model in advancing our understanding of transport properties of hot and dense quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Mass Mixing between QCD Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel level crossing phenomenon in the mass mixing between the QCD axions, one canonical QCD axion and one $Z_{\mathcal N}$ axion. The level crossing can take place at or slightly before the QCD phase transition critical temperature, depending on the ratio of the axion decay constants $\sim1.69$. The cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues in these two scenarios is similar; however, the transition of axion energy density differs significantly. Finally, we estimate the relic density of the QCD axion dark matter in this context. Additionally, this level crossing may have some interesting cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis, dark matter and gravitational waves from an extended canonical seesaw scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a canonical type-I seesaw scenario, the Standard Model is extended with three singlet right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) $N_i, i=1,2,3$ with masses $M_i, i=1,2,3$ to simultaneously explain sub-eV masses of light neutrinos and baryon asymmetry of the Universe at high scales. In this paper, we show that a relatively low-scale thermal leptogenesis accompanied by gravitational wave signatures is possible when the type-I seesaw is extended with a singlet fermion ($S$) and a singlet scalar ($\rho$), where $S$ and $\rho$ are odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. We also add a vector-like fermion doublet $\Psi$ and impose a $Z^\prime_2$ symmetry under which both $N_1$ and $\Psi$ are odd while all other particles are even. This gives rise to a singlet-doublet Majorana fermion dark matter in our setup. At a high scale, the $Z_2$ symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value of $\rho$ and leads to : (i) mixing between RHNs ($N_2, N_3$) and S, and (ii) formation of Domain walls (DWs). In the former case, the final lepton asymmetry is generated by the out-of-equilibrium decay of $S$, which dominantly mixes with $N_2$. We show that the scale of thermal leptogenesis can be lowered to $M_S \sim 2 \times 10^6$ GeV, which is \textit{three} orders of magnitude lower than the thermal leptogenesis in canonical type-I seesaw. In the latter case, the disappearance of the DWs gives observable gravitational wave signatures, which can be probed at LISA, DECIGO, ${\rm \mu ARES}$ etc.</description>

      <title>On the Temperature Effects in QCD Axion Mass Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the QCD axion mass mixing in the early Universe and investigate the temperature effects in the mixing. We explore the scenario where two $Z_{\mathcal N}$ QCD axions undergo mass mixing during the QCD phase transition, yielding three distinct mixing scenarios: the mixing I, II, and III. These scenarios are realized through fine-tuning of the axion decay constants, the temperature parameters, as well as the value of $\mathcal N$. We conduct a thorough analysis of the level crossing phenomena in these three mixing scenarios, detailing the conditions under which they occur. Notably, in the mixing I and II, the level crossing precedes the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition ($T_{\rm QCD}$), with minimal non-essential discrepancies in the cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues at $T_{\rm QCD}$. In contrast, the mixing III exhibits a unique double level crossings, occurring both before and at $T_{\rm QCD}$. Despite superficial similarities in axion evolution between the mixing II and III, we uncover fundamental differences between them. Additionally, we briefly address the transition in energy density between the two axions within our mixing scenarios. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of the QCD axion in the early Universe and its potential implications for cold dark matter.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Determination of Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Being closely connected to the origin of the nucleon mass, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon have attracted significant attention in recent years. We present the first model-independent determinations of the gravitational form factors of the pion and nucleon at the physical pion mass, using a data-driven dispersive approach. The so-called "last global unknown property" of the nucleon, the $D$-term, is determined to be $-3.38^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$. The root mean square radius of the scalar trace density inside the nucleon is determined to be $(0.97 \pm0.03)~\text{fm}$. Notably, this value is larger than the proton charge radius, suggesting a modern structural view of the nucleon where gluons, responsible for most of the nucleon mass, are distributed over a larger spatial region than quarks, which dominate the charge distribution, indicating that the radius of the trace density may be regarded as a confinement radius. We also predict the nucleon angular momentum and mechanical radii, providing further insights into the intricate internal structure of the nucleon.</description>

Abstract: We provide an exact analytical solution to the nonlinear relativistic Boltzmann equation for a homogeneous, anisotropically scattering massless gas. Utilizing a BKW-like trial solution, we cast the Boltzmann equation into a set of nonlinear coupled equations for scalar moments, based on which the analytical solution is derived. One remarkable feature of our analytical solution lies in the nontrivial scattering angle dependence. We also show that this analytical solution admits a stable fixed point corresponding to the equilibrium solution as long as the parameters are physically feasible. Furthermore, a clear correspondence between our solution and the BKW solution pertaining to nonrelativistic Maxwell molecules is established, thereby clarifying the non-existence of a BKW-type solution in the relativistic domain for massive particles.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Radiation from Scalar Fields in Modified Gravity: A Comparison with Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze electromagnetic (EM) radiations arising from scalar fields predicted by modified gravity theories and compare these features with those induced by axion-like particles (ALPs). Scalar and axion fields couple differently to the EM field due to their distinct parity properties, $\phi F_{\mu\nu} F^{\mu\nu}$ for scalar fields and $\phi F_{\mu\nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu\nu}$ for axions. Building on analytical methods developed for ALPs, this work presents a theoretical feasibility analysis that demonstrates how the scalar field in modified gravity could produce observable EM signatures from oscillating field configurations. We also show that resonance effects can amplify the EM radiation for the scalar field under specific conditions, and that the enhancement mechanisms depend on the coupling structure and the configuration of the background magnetic field. Resonance phenomena can accentuate the differences in signal strength and spectral features, potentially aiding future observations in distinguishing scalar fields from ALPs. This work provides a theoretical framework for studying generic pure and pseudo-scalar fields on an equal footing and suggests new avenues for observational tests of modified gravity scenarios alongside ALP models.</description>

      <title>Testing the RG Running of the Leptonic Dirac CP Phase with Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the possibility of using the near detector at reactor neutrino experiments to probe the renormalization group (RG) running effect on the leptonic Dirac CP phase $\delta_D$. Although the reactor neutrino oscillation cannot directly measure $\delta_D$, it can probe the deviation $\Delta \delta \equiv \delta_D(Q^2_d) - \delta_D(Q^2_p)$ caused by the RG running. Being a key element, the mismatched momentum transfers at neutrino production ($Q^2_p$) and detection ($Q^2_d$) processes can differ by two orders. We illustrate this concept with the upcoming Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO, also known as JUNO-TAO) experiment and obtain the projected sensitivity to the CP RG running beta function $\beta_\delta$.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using LBT or the combination of jet samples from PYTHIA and LBT, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. We further study the performance of these machine learning models on evaluating the nuclear modification factor of jets, and find that while the unfolding procedure is necessary for correcting residuals in reconstructed jet momenta, models trained on samples incorporating quenched jets still achieve superior accuracy than those trained on vacuum jets even after unfolding.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we revisit the possible new physics (NP) solutions by analyzing the observables associated with $B\to D^{(\ast)}\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$ decays. To explore the structure of new physics, the form factors of $B\to D^{(\ast)}$ decays play a crucial role. In this study, we utilize the form factor results obtained from a simultaneous fit to Belle data and lattice QCD calculations. Using these form factors, we conduct a global fit of the new physics Wilson coefficients, incorporating the most recent experimental data. Additionally, we use the form factors and Wilson coefficients to make predictions for physical observables, including the lepton flavor universality ratio $R_{D^{(\ast)}}$, polarized observables, and the normalized angular coefficients $\langle I\rangle$'s related to the four-fold decays $B\to D^{\ast}(\to D\pi, D\gamma)\tau\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$. These predictions are calculated in both model-independent scenarios and for three different leptoquark models.</description>

      <title>Imaginary potential and thermal width in the spinning black hole background from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the imaginary potential of heavy quarkonium in the spinning black hole background. Then we estimate the thermal width, which is determined by the imaginary part of the finite temperature potential. In the ultra-local description, the boosted fluid represents a globally rotating fluid. Using a holographic approach, we systematically analyze how boost parameter influences these quantities. Our results reveal that increasing boost parameter causes the imaginary potential to emerge at smaller interquark distances, suggesting that boost parameter accelerates quarkonium melting. Furthermore, we find that boost parameter enhances the thermal width, indicating greater instability of the bound state at higher boost parameter. Notably, we observe that the effect of boost parameter on quarkonium dissociation is more pronounced when the axis of the quark-antiquark pair is transverse to the direction of boost parameter.</description>

      <title>Exploring the two-body strong decay properties of the possible $\Lambda_cK^{*}$ and $\Sigma_cK^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we apply the effective Lagrangian approach to investigate the two-body strong decay behaviors of the possible $\Lambda_c K^*$ and $\Sigma_c K^{(*)}$ molecules, as predicted in our previous study [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.054011}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{108}, 054011 (2023)}]. Our results indicate that the decay width for the coupled $\Sigma_c K / \Lambda_c K^* / \Sigma_c K^*$ molecule with $I(J^P) = 1/2(1/2^-)$ is on the order of several MeV, with the $D_s N$ channel being dominant. For the coupled $\Lambda_c K^* / \Sigma_c K^*$ molecule with $1/2(1/2^-, 3/2^-)$, the decay widths are on the order of tens of MeV, with the dominant channels being $\Sigma_c K$ and $\Sigma_c^* K$, respectively. For the $\Sigma_c K^*$ molecules with $1/2(1/2^-)$, the decay width can reach one hundred MeV, with $\Sigma_c K$ and $\Lambda_c K$ being the dominant decay channels. The decay widths for the $\Sigma_c K^*$ molecules with $1/2(3/2^-)$ and $3/2(1/2^-)$ are on the order of tens of MeV, with the dominant decay modes being $\Sigma_c^* K$ and $\Sigma_c K$, respectively. The branching ratios for all the discussed channels show little dependence on the binding energies.</description>

      <title>Strange quark stars in modified vector MIT bag model: role of $\rho$ and $\phi$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we study the properties of strange quark stars (SQSs) using the vector MIT bag model with modification in vector channels. Unlike recent studies which only consider interactions through $\omega$ mesons, we analyze the possibility of $\rho$ and $\phi$ vector channels. We consider two types of higher order non-linear self-interaction terms for the vector mesons. With these modifications, we computed the equation of state (EoS) and mass-radius of strange stars for different values of vector coupling strength. Considerations of $\rho$ and $\phi$ vector mesons along with $\omega$, as well as an increase in the strength of vector coupling $g_v$, enhance the mass and radius of SQSs. For two kind of non-linear self-interactions of vector mesons considered in the present calculations, we observe the SQSs with maximum mass $2.48$ and $2.42 M_{\odot}$ for the vector coupling $g_v = 3$. Corresponding radii of these SQSs are found to be $12.27$ and $12.18$ km, respectively. We also calculate the tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$, the Love number $k_2$ and the gravitational redshift of SQSs. The tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$ is observed to increase with $g_v$, with appreciable effect for low mass stars.</description>

      <title>Axion Portal to Scalar Dark Matter: Unveiling Stabilizing Symmetry Footprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of an axion-like particle (ALP) as a portal between the dark and visible sectors. Unlike conventional studies, which typically assume fermionic dark matter (DM), we explore the phenomenological implications of scalar DM within this ALP portal framework. A key challenge arises from the fact that the interaction between the ALP spacetime derivative and the spin-one current of the scalar DM can be a redundant operator, which may be removed via a field redefinition. However, this interaction reveals a profound connection to the underlying global symmetry that stabilizes the DM particle. We choose a non-Abelian discrete symmetry, ensuring the persistence of the DM-ALP interactions, and in doing so, unveil a rich phenomenology. Working within a general effective field theory approach, we identify the following hallmark features of our scenario: (i) a relic density determined by semi-annihilations, with an abundance independent of ALP couplings to the visible sector; (ii) direct detection rates naturally suppressed; (iii) indirect detection spectra enriched relative to pure annihilation scenarios, with rates also independent of ALP couplings to visible particles. Lastly, we discuss potential microscopic origins for this framework and highlight the broader implications of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrival time of electromagnetic signals traveling in chiral cosmic media is investigated in the context of Maxwell-Carroll-Field-Jackiw electrodynamics. Considering the interstellar medium (ISM) as a cold, ionized, chiral plasma, we derive the time delay between two traveling signals, expressed in terms of a modified dispersion measure (DM) which receives additional contribution from the chiral parameters. Faraday rotation angle is also addressed in this chiral plasma scenario, yielding modified rotation measures (RM). Using DMs data from five pulsars, we establish constraints on the chiral parameter magnitude at the order of $10^{-23}$ -- $10^{-22}$ GeV. On the other hand, the Faraday rotation retrieved from RM measurements implied upper constraints as tight as $10^{-36}$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of heavy quarks by elastic and radiative scatterings in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our investigation of heavy quark transport coefficients in the effective dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) -- which reproduces nonperturbative QCD phenomena in the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) according to lattice QCD data -- by including inelastic $2 \to 3$ processes with massive gluon radiation, in addition to elastic $2 \to 2$ parton scattering. Both elastic and inelastic reactions are evaluated at leading order using DQPM-based effective propagators and vertices, accounting for all channels and their interferences. Based on the obtained matrix elements, we calculate various observables connected to a charm quark. First, we calculate the total cross section of a charm quark with the medium partons as functions of temperature and collision energy. Second, we obtain the drag $\mathcal{A}$ coefficient and $\hat{q}$ coefficient of a charm quark as functions of temperature and momentum and also compare our results with those obtained using the Zakharov model for the momentum-dependent strong coupling for the elastic and radiative vertices with a heavy quark, highlighting the importance of the choice of the strong coupling in the determination of transport coefficients. Third, we calculate the spatial diffusion coefficient of a charm quark and compare our results with those obtained using other approaches. Finally, we explore the mass dependence of the diffusion coefficient by comparing the results for charm quark, bottom quark, and infinitely-heavy quark. We found that inelastic processes can play a significant role in the determination of the transport coefficients at large transverse momenta, but are strongly suppressed at low transverse momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mirror matter from the dark hidden sector with the same particle content and gauge interactions as in the standard model is still an interesting candidate for dark matter. Several experiments on search for positronium and neutron oscillations into their mirror partner have been conducted recently. In this work we consider the transitions $K^0-K^0_m$ of a neutral kaon into a hidden mirror kaon. It is shown that their probability can be probed with the sensitivity of $P(K^0-K^0_m )\lesssim 10^{-7}$ from the search for missing-energy events in the NA64 experiment at the CERN SPS with $\sim 10^{11}$ $K^+$ on target.This would result in a limit on the $K^0-K^0_m$ mixing parameter much stronger than the similar bound estimated from the cosmological considerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-loop corrections to the neutrino mass matrix in the N-B-LSSM. We obtain the N-B-LSSM from the $U(1)$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). By adding three generation right-handed neutrino superfields and three Higgs singlets, the model generates tiny neutrino masses at the tree level through the first type seesaw mechanism. However, one-loop corrections are essential for understanding neutrino masses and mixing angles. We calculate the neutrino mass variance and mixing angle from both normal order neutrino mass spectrum and inverse order neutrino mass spectrum. This study provides new theoretical support for exploring the mechanism of neutrino mass generation in the supersymmetric model and provides clues for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).</description>

      <title>A New State of Matter between the Hadronic Phase and the Quark-Gluon Plasma?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice-QCD simulations and theoretical arguments hint at the existence of an intermediate phase of strongly interacting matter between a confined hadron gas and a deconfined Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP). We qualitatively and semi-quantitatively explore and differentiate the phase structures in the temperature window from the QCD pseudo-critical temperature $T_c\simeq 160\;\text{MeV}$ to the pure-gluonic deconfinement temperature $T_d\simeq 285\;\text{MeV}$. We propose a three-regime picture using a hadron resonance gas (HRG) description augmented with the glueball spectrum based on the analysis of a large number, $N_c$, of colors. We estimate the entropy density from our model to confirm that the lattice-QCD data are bracketed with three regimes, i.e., a hadron gas, a QGP, and a new phase for $T_c \lesssim T \lesssim T_d$. In this new phase that we name a Spaghetti of Quarks with Glueballs (SQGB), thermal degrees of freedom of quarks are deconfined, yet gluons remain confined in glueballs. Since the Hagedorn temperature, $T_H\sim 285\;\text{MeV}$, is universal in the meson and the glueball sectors, in the infinite $N_c$ limit, the phase diagram in the plane of the baryon chemical potential and the temperature is reduced to the one with the confined and deconfined phases and Quarkyonic Matter at high density. At large but finite $N_c$, an SQGB window may open between these phases. We point out that the SQGB has interesting similarities with Quarkyonic Matter and that this matter in the large $N_c$ limit is confined as measured by the interaction between heavy quarks, but behaves in other respects like a quasi-free gas of quarks. As a result of the extrapolation to $N_c=3$, we present a revised phase diagram with the SQGB phase bounded by thermal crossovers. Finally, we give a quantitative analysis of chiral symmetry restoration in the SQGB phase.</description>

      <title>Measurement of string tension and initial temperature from transverse momentum spectra of heavy quarkonia in proton-proton collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string tension ($\kappa$) in the Schwinger mechanism and the effective temperature ($T$) in Bose-Einstein statistics are extracted from the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of heavy quarkonia produced in proton-proton (p+p) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Here, $T$ derived from the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra also represents the initial temperature of the collision system, as transverse flow has not yet formed when heavy quarkonia are produced. The related parameters ($\kappa$ and $T$) are obtained by fitting the experimental $p_T$ spectra of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon(nS)$ ($n=1$, 2, and 3) within various rapidity intervals, produced in p+p collisions at center-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=13$ and 8 TeV, as measured by the LHCb Collaboration. It is found that the multi-component distribution structured within the framework of the Schwinger mechanism or Bose-Einstein statistics can effectively describe the heavy quarkonium $p_T$ spectra in small collision systems. With decreasing rapidity in the forward region, both $\kappa$ and $T$ increase, indicating a directly proportional relationship between them. Based on $\kappa$, the average minimum strong force radius of participant quarks is determined.</description>

      <title>The nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Towards a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states are both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

Abstract: The structure of the mass matrix, a challenging problem in the Standard Model, is closely related to flavor phenomenology and the understanding of the Yukawa interaction. We derive a factorized mass structure based on observed fermion mass hierarchies, investigating the role of $SO(2)^f$ family symmetry in explaining the approximate degeneracy of light quark generations and its connection to flavor mixing. Our calculation includes the slightest modification from the lightest fermions by $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ hierarchy corrections. Using this model-independent framework, we systematically analyze all mass patterns and perform comprehensive fits to both quark CKM and lepton PMNS mixing data with extended normal-ordered Dirac neutrinos. The results demonstrate this framework's capacity to unify flavor phenomena while simultaneously providing new insights into the fundamental nature of Yukawa interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a light-front model for the pion that explicitly incorporates the gluonic degree of freedom. In this framework, high-energy scattering off the pion is described by an active gluon, while the remaining constituents are treated as a spectator system with an effective mass. The mass spectrum and light-front wave functions (LFWFs) of the pion are determined by solving two Schr\"odinger-like equations derived from quantum chromodynamics: the light-front holographic equation in the chiral limit and the 't~Hooft equation. Using the resulting LFWFs, we compute the gluon distributions within pion, including the parton distribution functions in comparison with the available global fits, generalized parton distributions, and transverse momentum-dependent distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the obtained LFWFs provide a good description of the gravitational form factors of pion when compared with the recent lattice QCD results.</description>

      <title>Particle Production Scenario in an Algebraically Coupled Quintessence Field with a Dark Matter Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of an algebraically coupled quintessence field with a dark matter fluid, focusing on particle production through the action principle via a modified interaction Lagrangian. The interaction parameter serves as the source of dark matter particle production and entropy generation. As particle creation occurs due to the interaction between the field and fluid sectors, the system exhibits additional pressure. Our analysis includes studying the system's dynamics by considering an exponential type of interaction corresponding to the field's exponential potential. We assess the system's background dynamics using the dynamical system stability technique to derive the constraints on the model parameters. Additionally, we determine the best-fit values of the model parameters against two combinations of data sets: (i) CC+Pantheon+SH0ES, and (ii) CC+Pantheon+SH0ES+SDSS BAO+ DESI BAO. By employing a comprehensive data analysis technique, we compare the evidence of our models to flat $\Lambda$CDM. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), one of the models emerges as a robust alternative to $\Lambda$CDM when considering the joint data sets.</description>

      <title>Looking for Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Mergers via Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observation has provided numerous insights into the merger of astrophysical black holes. In contrast to other violent events (e.g. supernovae), they are, however, not expected to lead to significant emissions of photons and neutrinos. In this paper we discuss a scenario that would lead to characteristic observable gamma ray bursts, which would provide numerous hints to physics beyond General Relativity. Starting from the hypothesis that micro-black holes (called morsels) are formed during the merger process, we show that it is possible to observe their Hawking radiation, which takes the form of gamma ray bursts of a uniquely characteristic form: with energies in the TeV range, their temporal structure is unlike that stemming from any other astrophysical event. Notably, the time delay from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels, allowed by the unaccounted merger mass, leads to a Hawking radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC, and gamma ray space telescopes, such as Fermi-LAT. This renders the hypothesis of morsel creation experimentally testable, and we provide the first concrete bounds on the total mass of morsels formed in specific events.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger signatures of a deformed magnetar in gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a newly formed magnetized neutron-star (NS) as a power source of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the light of both gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiations. The compressible and incompressible fluids are employed in order to model the secular evolution of stable Maclaurian spheroids. It is shown that the GW and EM emissions evolve as a function of eccentricity and rotational frequency with time. We find that the luminosity characteristics crucially depend on NS parameters such as magnitude and structure of magnetic field, ellipticity and the equation of state (EoS) of the fluid. The presence of X-ray flares, whose origins are not yet well understood, can be captured in our model regarding some specific nuclear EoSs. Our model allowing us to explain flares that occur within the wide range of $ 10$ to $10^4$ s and the peak EM luminosity in the order of $10^{46}$ - $10^{51}$ $\rm \text{erg} s^{-1}$ by using a reasonable set of parameters, such as magnetic field strength around $10^{14}-10^{16}$ G, the quadrupole-to-dipole ratio of magnetic field up to 500. By applying our model to a sample of GRB X-ray flares observed by the Swift/X-ray Telescope, we try to constraint the crucial parameters of a deformed magnetar via a Marcov Chain Monte Carlo fitting method. Our analysis shows that ongoing and upcoming joint multimessenger detections can be used to understand the nature of a GRB's central engine and its evolution at the early times of the burst formation.</description>

      <title>ALP production from light primordial black holes: The role of superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (LPBHs) with masses in the range $10$~g~$\leq M_{\rm BH} \leq 10^9$~g, although they evaporate before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can play a significant role in the production of both dark matter and dark radiation. In particular, LPBHs can evaporate into light axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) with masses $m_a \lesssim$~MeV, contributing to the effective number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$. Additionally, heavy scalar particles known as {\em moduli}, predicted by string theory, can be produced both via Hawking evaporation and through amplification by a mechanism called {\em superradiant instability} in the case of spinning primordial black holes (PBHs). These moduli can subsequently decay into ALPs, further amplifying their abundance. In this work, we calculate the number density of ALPs in the presence of moduli enhanced by superradiance for Kerr PBHs. Using current limits on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ from Planck satellite observations, we derive updated constraints on this scenario.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with Gauss-Bonnet term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. Moreover, we assume a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter term. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. Specifically, we introduce dimensionless variables based on the Hubble normalization approach and a new set based on the matter-scalar field normalization. These two sets of variables allow for a comprehensive phase space analysis. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term.</description>

      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Moreover VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG). The term $\chi$ is not zero, although largely fluctuating around zero before the gradient flow and tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ($\tau$) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also much suppressed. The bosonic definition of the topological charge $Q_t$ and its Abelian counterpart $Q_a\equiv (g^2/16\pi^2)\int d^4x \Tr(f_{\mu\nu}f_{\mu\nu}^*)$ written by Abelian field strengths are measured also on the lattices. When $\chi$ is zero, $Q_a$=3$Q_t$ is expected theoretically, but a simple lattice definition of $Q_a$ is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG, when $Q_t$ is around -1.</description>

      <title>QCD predictions for physical multimeson scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use lattice QCD calculations of the finite-volume spectra of systems of two and three mesons to determine, for the first time, three-particle scattering amplitudes with physical quark masses. Our results are for combinations of $\pi^+$ and $K^+$, at a lattice spacing $a=0.063\;$fm, and in the isospin-symmetric limit. We also obtain accurate results for maximal-isospin two-meson amplitudes, with those for $\pi^+ K^+$ and $2K^+$ being the first determinations at the physical point. Dense lattice spectra are obtained using the stochastic Laplacian-Heaviside method, and the analysis leading to scattering amplitudes is done using the relativistic finite-volume formalism. Results are compared to chiral perturbation theory and to phenomenological fits to experimental data, finding good agreement.</description>

      <title>Triple-charmed Hadron from Coalescence in Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Unlike proton-proton collisions, nuclear collisions produce both deconfined matter and abundant charm quark pairs, which can coalesce to form the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon, thereby significantly enhancing its production. We employ the Langevin model and the Instantaneous Coalescence Model (LICM), coupled with hydrodynamic simulations, to study charm quark diffusion and coalescence into the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon in expanding QCD matter. The production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ is governed by the charm quark densities and the in-medium wavefunctions of the $\Omega_{ccc}$, which determines the coalescence probability for the three charm quarks. We calculate the $\Omega_{ccc}$ production with realistic charm diffusions and different in-medium wave functions of $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon. We find that the production of the $\Omega_{ccc}$ baryon is sensitive to these factors, which aids in understanding its properties in the hot QCD medium.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that primordial black holes (PBHs) lighter than $10^9 \, \text{g}$, which evaporated before the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, can induce significant isocurvature perturbations due to their biased clustering amplitude and the branching ratio of the Hawking radiation differing from the abundance ratio. By leveraging the upper bound on the isocurvature perturbations from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies reported by the Planck collaboration, we derive a new upper bound on the abundance of these light PBHs.</description>

      <title>Super-Higher-Form Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the study of higher-form-symmetries to theories with supersymmetry. Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weil symmetries whose generators are constructed using invariant differential forms in super-manifolds. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetries and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges. Notably, the charge is proportional to the super-linking number between the super-hypersurface supporting the symmetry generator and the one supporting the defect.</description>

      <title>Solar System Constraints on Light Propagation from Higher Derivative Corrections to General Relativity and Implications for Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the two derivative action of gravitation is specified uniquely, higher derivative operators are also allowed with coefficients that are not specified uniquely by effective field theory. We focus on a four derivative operator in which the Riemann tensor couples directly to the electromagnetic field $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$. We compute the corresponding corrections to the Shapiro time delay in the solar system and compare this to data from the Cassini probe. We place an observational upper bound on the coefficient $a$ at 95\% confidence $|a|&lt;26\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. By way of motivation, we also compare this to a weak gravity conjecture (WGC) prediction of a bound on the coefficients $a,\,b$ of four derivative operators involving the graviton and the photon; this includes the above term $a\,R_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F^{\mu\nu}F^{\alpha\beta}$ as well as $b\,F^4$. We show that by using the observed value of the $b$ coefficient from measurements of light by light scattering, which arises in the Standard Model from integrating out the electron, the WGC predicted bound for $a$ is $a\lesssim 7.8\,(1000\,\mbox{km})^2$. This is consistent with the above observational bound, but is intriguingly close and can be further probed in other observations.</description>

      <title>$\Xi_c \to \Xi$ form factors from lattice QCD with domain-wall quarks: A new piece in the puzzle of $\Xi_c^0$ decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD determination of the vector and axial-vector form factors that describe the charm-baryon semileptonic decays $\Xi_c\to \Xi \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The calculation uses a domain-wall action for the up, down, and strange quarks, and an anisotropic clover action for the charm quark. We use four ensembles of gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, with lattice spacings between 0.111 and 0.073 fm and pion masses ranging from 420 to 230 MeV. We present Standard-Model predictions for the decay rates and branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi_c^-\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ and $\Xi_c^+\to\Xi_c^0\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ for $\ell=e,\mu$. In particular, we obtain $\Gamma(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e)/|V_{cs}|^2 = 0.2515(73)\text{ ps}^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e) = 3.58(12)\:\%$. These values are higher than those predicted by a previous lattice calculation and substantially higher than the experimentally measured values, but consistent with expectations from approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06269v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g. that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories, detectors, and distributions in the critical ${\rm O}(N)$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore light-ray operators in the critical O$(N)$ model in the large-$N$ limit, focusing on leading-twist and leading ``horizontal" trajectories. We distinguish between light-ray operators in two conformal frames: detector operators, which characterize event shapes of final states, and distribution operators, which probe initial-state distributions. In particular, we identify parton distribution functions (PDFs) and collinear functions as matrix elements of appropriate distribution operators. We renormalize some simple detector operators at leading order in $1/N$, allowing us to extract the Regge intercept and the anomalous spin of the leading horizontal trajectory. We furthermore renormalize distribution versions of these operators, obtaining the leading-twist splitting function and a BFKL-type kernel, which match results from the detector frame. Finally, we show how these results can be read off from OPE data encoded in the Bethe-Salpeter resummation of conformal four-point functions.</description>

      <title>What is the Quark-Gluon Plasma made of?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article surveys our present understanding of the internal structure of the fully developed quark-gluon plasma at temperatures outside the crossover region. The theoretical part of the review covers perturbative and nonperturbative approaches to quark-gluon plasma structure, in particular, hard-thermal loop effective theory, lattice QCD and the functional renormalization group. The phenomenological part of the review scrutinizes the information that has been derived from bulk observables and hard probes in relativistic heavy ion collisions in terms of how it informs our knowledge about the structure of the quark-gluon plasma. The final section lists possible avenues for future progress.</description>

      <title>Perturbative K\"ahler Moduli Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present two classes of inflationary models in the framework of type IIB string theory. The inflatons correspond to blow-up K\"ahler modulus arising from compactifying type IIB string theory on a Calabi-Yau. Using perturbative corrections, we first highlight a procedure for stabilising more than one K\"ahler modulus. For the case of two K\"ahler moduli, we explicitly construct two classes of inflationary potentials within the K\"ahler cone which satisfy both EFT and cosmological constraints. The first class of models, arising from moduli redefinition of the blow-up mode, garners a potential of the form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{1} \phi^{2/3})$ align with CMB data with scalar-to-tensor ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-2}$. The second class of models, which have been recently proposed as loop blow-up inflation, have a form $V(\phi)=V_{0}(1+C_{2}\phi^{-2/3})$, also agrees with CMB data with scalar-to tensor-ratio $r\lesssim 10^{-8}$. Our work differs from the original loop blow-up inflation in terms of stabilization mechanism and subsequently the scalar-to tensor ratio.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A as a Signal of Electroweak Vacuum Turbulence in Merging Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of the ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A ($\sim$220 PeV) by KM3NeT telescope poses a challenge to conventional astrophysical models, particularly in light of the absence of similar $\gtrsim$100 PeV events in IceCube data, despite its larger exposure. We propose a novel mechanism in which binary black hole mergers act as transient neutrino sources via gravitationally induced electroweak vacuum instability. In this scenario, the extreme spacetime curvature near the horizons during the final inspiral phase destabilizes the Higgs vacuum, triggering nucleation of true-vacuum bubbles. Collisions between these bubbles produce microscopic black holes that rapidly evaporate via Hawking radiation, emitting intense, short-lived bursts of neutrinos with energies exceeding 100 PeV. The resulting neutrino fluence follows a heavy-tailed distribution, allowing rare but highly luminous sources to account for events like KM3-230213A while remaining consistent with IceCube's non-detections. This framework links gravitational wave sources to ultra-high-energy neutrino production and suggests that future multi-messenger observations may detect electromagnetic signatures from microscopic black hole evaporation.</description>
