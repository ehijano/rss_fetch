      <title>Neighborhood Stability in Double/Debiased Machine Learning with Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies double/debiased machine learning (DML) methods applied to weakly dependent data. We allow observations to be situated in a general metric space that accommodates spatial and network data. Existing work implements cross-fitting by excluding from the training fold observations sufficiently close to the evaluation fold. We find in simulations that this can result in exceedingly small training fold sizes, particularly with network data. We therefore seek to establish the validity of DML without cross-fitting, building on recent work by Chen et al. (2022). They study i.i.d. data and require the machine learner to satisfy a natural stability condition requiring insensitivity to data perturbations that resample a single observation. We extend these results to dependent data by strengthening stability to "neighborhood stability," which requires insensitivity to resampling observations in any slowly growing neighborhood. We show that existing results on the stability of various machine learners can be adapted to verify neighborhood stability.</description>

      <title>Assaults on Judicial Independence under the Pretense of Modernization: Evidence from Venezuela</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how government-orchestrated assaults on the judiciary, disguised as modernization efforts, undermine judicial independence. Our study focuses on Venezuela's constitutional overhaul in the early 2000s, initiated by Hugo Ch\'avez and implemented through a judicial emergency committee. We employ a hybrid synthetic control and difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of populist attacks on judicial independence trajectories. By comparing Venezuela to a stable pool of countries without radical constitutional changes, our identification strategy isolates the effect of populist assaults from unobservable confounders and common time trends. Our findings reveal that authoritarian interventions lead to an immediate and lasting breakdown of judicial independence. The deterioration in judicial independence vis-\'a-vis the estimated counterfactual is robust to variations in the donor pool composition. It does not appear to be driven by pre-existing judicial changes and withstands numerous temporal and spatial placebo checks across over nine million randomly sequenced donor samples.</description>

      <title>Learning bounds for doubly-robust covariate shift adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution shift between the training domain and the test domain poses a key challenge for modern machine learning. An extensively studied instance is the \emph{covariate shift}, where the marginal distribution of covariates differs across domains, while the conditional distribution of outcome remains the same. The doubly-robust (DR) estimator, recently introduced by \cite{kato2023double}, combines the density ratio estimation with a pilot regression model and demonstrates asymptotic normality and $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, even when the pilot estimates converge slowly. However, the prior arts has focused exclusively on deriving asymptotic results and has left open the question of non-asymptotic guarantees for the DR estimator.
  This paper establishes the first non-asymptotic learning bounds for the DR covariate shift adaptation. Our main contributions are two-fold: (\romannumeral 1) We establish \emph{structure-agnostic} high-probability upper bounds on the excess target risk of the DR estimator that depend only on the $L^2$-errors of the pilot estimates and the Rademacher complexity of the model class, without assuming specific procedures to obtain the pilot estimate, and (\romannumeral 2) under \emph{well-specified parameterized models}, we analyze the DR covariate shift adaptation based on modern techniques for non-asymptotic analysis of MLE, whose key terms governed by the Fisher information mismatch term between the source and target distributions. Together, these findings bridge asymptotic efficiency properties and a finite-sample out-of-distribution generalization bounds, providing a comprehensive theoretical underpinnings for the DR covariate shift adaptation.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for dynamic portfolio optimization under market uncertainty and risk. The proposed model integrates a Sharpe ratio-based reward function with direct risk control mechanisms, including maximum drawdown and volatility constraints. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to learn adaptive asset allocation strategies over historical financial time series. Model performance is benchmarked against mean-variance and equal-weight portfolio strategies using backtesting on high-performing equities. Results indicate that the DRL agent stabilizes volatility successfully but suffers from degraded risk-adjusted returns due to over-conservative policy convergence, highlighting the challenge of balancing exploration, return maximization, and risk mitigation. The study underscores the need for improved reward shaping and hybrid risk-aware strategies to enhance the practical deployment of DRL-based portfolio allocation models.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences with Compositional Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13925v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies Difference-in-Differences (DiD) setups with repeated cross-sectional data and potential compositional changes across time periods. We begin our analysis by deriving the efficient influence function and the semiparametric efficiency bound for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT). We introduce nonparametric estimators that attain the semiparametric efficiency bound under mild rate conditions on the estimators of the nuisance functions, exhibiting a type of rate doubly robust (DR) property. Additionally, we document a trade-off related to compositional changes: We derive the asymptotic bias of DR DiD estimators that erroneously exclude compositional changes and the efficiency loss when one fails to correctly rule out compositional changes. We propose a nonparametric Hausman-type test for compositional changes based on these trade-offs. The finite sample performance of the proposed DiD tools is evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical application. We consider extensions of our framework that accommodate double machine learning procedures with cross-fitting, and setups when some units are observed in both pre- and post-treatment periods. As a by-product of our analysis, we present a new uniform stochastic expansion of the local polynomial multinomial logit estimator, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Robust Tests for Factor-Augmented Regressions with an Application to the novel EA-MD-QD Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four novel tests of equal predictive accuracy and encompassing \`a la Pitarakis (2023, 2025) for factor-augmented regressions, where factors are estimated using cross-section averages (CAs) of grouped series. Our inferential theory is asymptotically normal and robust to an overspecification of the number of factors. Our tests are empirically relevant as they accommodate for different degrees of predictor persistence and remain invariant to the location of structural breaks in the loadings. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that our tests exhibit excellent local power properties. Finally, we apply our tests to the novel EA-MD-QD dataset by Barigozzi et al. (2024) - which covers the Euro Area as a whole and its primary member countries - and show that factors estimated by CAs offer substantial predictive power.</description>

      <title>Robust Structural Estimation under Misspecified Latent-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimation and counterfactual analysis in dynamic structural models rely on assumptions about the dynamic process of latent variables, which may be misspecified. We propose a framework to quantify the sensitivity of scalar parameters of interest (e.g., welfare, elasticity) to such assumptions. We derive bounds on the scalar parameter by perturbing a reference dynamic process, while imposing a stationarity condition for time-homogeneous models or a Markovian condition for time-inhomogeneous models. The bounds are the solutions to optimization problems, for which we derive a computationally tractable dual formulation. We establish consistency, convergence rate, and asymptotic distribution for the estimator of the bounds. We demonstrate the approach with two applications: an infinite-horizon dynamic demand model for new cars in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, and a finite-horizon dynamic labor supply model for taxi drivers in New York City. In the car application, perturbed price elasticities deviate by at most 15.24% from the reference elasticities, while perturbed estimates of consumer surplus from an additional $3,000 electric vehicle subsidy vary by up to 102.75%. In the labor supply application, the perturbed Frisch labor supply elasticity deviates by at most 76.83% for weekday drivers and 42.84% for weekend drivers.</description>
