      <title>Self-organized first-order transition from foreshock to mainshock in earthquake sequences induced by heat, fluid pressure, and porosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthquake cycles are studied by taking into account the interactions among slip, fluid pressure, temperature, and porosity on the fault planes, which are known to play a crucial role in earthquake dynamics. The spring-block model with a single block is employed. A first-order transition from foreshock to mainshock occurring spontaneously in earthquake sequences is discovered both analytically and numerically. This transition is induced by these interactions. It is shown that the function of the slip distance $u$, $F(u)$, defined as the sum of the difference between the energies stored in the driving spring before and after the slippage, and the energy dissipated during the slippage, governs the transition. The equation, $F(u)=0$, represents the energy balance before and after the slippage, and the solution $u=u_f$ describes the realized slip distance for each slippage event. The solutions discontinuously transition from small to large slippages in the sequence of earthquakes. This transition can be interpreted to be a self-organized first-order transition from small to large slippages. The former slippage is governed by pore generation, whereas the latter is governed by thermal pressurization. A phase diagram of the foreshocks and mainshocks, which is also considered a phase diagram of slow and fast earthquakes, is obtained.</description>

      <title>Geological Everything Model 3D: A Promptable Foundation Model for Unified and Zero-Shot Subsurface Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00419</link>

Abstract: Understanding Earth's subsurface is critical for energy transition, natural hazard mitigation, and planetary science. Yet subsurface analysis remains fragmented, with separate models required for structural interpretation, stratigraphic analysis, geobody segmentation, and property modeling-each tightly coupled to specific data distributions and task formulations. We introduce the Geological Everything Model 3D (GEM), a unified generative architecture that reformulates all these tasks as prompt-conditioned inference along latent structural frameworks derived from subsurface imaging. This formulation moves beyond task-specific models by enabling a shared inference mechanism, where GEM propagates human-provided prompts-such as well logs, masks, or structural sketches-along inferred structural frameworks to produce geologically coherent outputs. Through this mechanism, GEM achieves zero-shot generalization across tasks with heterogeneous prompt types, without retraining for new tasks or data sources. This capability emerges from a two-stage training process that combines self-supervised representation learning on large-scale field seismic data with adversarial fine-tuning using mixed prompts and labels across diverse subsurface tasks. GEM demonstrates broad applicability across surveys and tasks, including Martian radar stratigraphy analysis, structural interpretation in subduction zones, full seismic stratigraphic interpretation, geobody segmentation, and property modeling. By bridging expert knowledge with generative reasoning in a structurally aware manner, GEM lays the foundation for scalable, human-in-the-loop geophysical AI-transitioning from fragmented pipelines to a vertically integrated, promptable reasoning system.

      <title>Solute mixing in porous media with dispersion and buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the process of convective mixing in two-dimensional, homogeneous and isotropic porous media with dispersion. We considered a Rayleigh-Taylor instability in which the presence of a solute produces density differences driving the flow. The effect of dispersion is modelled using an anisotropic Fickian dispersion tensor (Bear, J. Geophys. Res. 1961). In addition to molecular diffusion ($D_m^*$), the solute is redistributed by an additional spreading, in longitudinal and transverse flow directions, which is quantified by the coefficients $D_l^*$ and $D_t^*$, respectively, and it is produced by the presence of the pores. The flow is controlled by three dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh-Darcy number $Ra$, defining the relative strength of convection and diffusion, and the dispersion parameters $r=D_l^*/D_t^*$ and $\Delta=D_m^*/D_t^*$. With the aid of numerical Darcy simulations, we investigate the mixing dynamics without and with dispersion. We find that in absence of dispersion ($\Delta\to\infty$) the dynamics is self-similar and independent of $Ra$, and the flow evolves following several regimes, which we analyse. Then we analyse the effect of dispersion on the flow evolution for a fixed value of the Rayleigh-Darcy number ($Ra=10^4$). A detailed analysis of the molecular and dispersive components of the mean scalar dissipation reveals a complex interplay between flow structures and solute mixing. The proposed theoretical framework, in combination with pore-scale simulations and bead packs experiments, can be used to validate and improve current dispersion models to obtain more reliable estimates of solute transport and spreading in buoyancy-driven subsurface flows.</description>
