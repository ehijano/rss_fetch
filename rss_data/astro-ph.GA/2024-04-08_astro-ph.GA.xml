      <title>oMEGACat II -- Photometry and proper motions for 1.4 million stars in Omega Centauri and its rotation in the plane of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) is the most massive globular cluster of the Milky Way. It is thought to be the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy because of its high mass and its complex stellar populations. To decipher its formation history and study its dynamics, we created the most comprehensive kinematic catalog for its inner region, by analyzing both archival and new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. Our catalog contains 1 395 781 proper-motion measurements out to the half-light radius of the cluster ($\sim$5.0') and down to $m_{F625W}\approx$25. The typical baseline for our proper-motion measurements is 20 years, leading to a median 1D proper motion precision of $\sim$11 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ for stars with $m_{F625W}\approx$18 mag, with even better precision ($\sim$6.6 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$) achieved in the extensively observed centermost (r$&lt;$1.5') region. In addition to our astrometric measurements, we also obtained precise HST photometry in seven filters spanning from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This allows detailed color-magnitude-diagram studies and to separate the multiple stellar populations of the cluster. In this work, we describe the data reduction used to obtain both the photometric and the proper-motion measurements. We also illustrate the creation and the content of our catalog, which is made publicly available. Finally, we present measurements of the plane-of-sky rotation of $\omega$ Cen in the previously unprobed inner few arcminutes and a precise measurement of the inclination $i = (43.6\pm1.5)^\circ$.</description>

      <title>An overlooked source of uncertainty in the mass of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the conventional approach to decomposing a rotation curve into a set of contributions from mass model components, the measurements of the rotation curve at different radii are taken to be independent. It is clear, however, that radial correlations are present in such data, for instance (but not only) because the orbital speed depends on the mass distribution at all (or, minimally, inner) radii. We adopt a very simple parametric form for a covariance matrix and constrain its parameters using Gaussian process regression. Applied to the rotation curve of the Milky Way, this suggests the presence of correlations between neighbouring rotation curve points with amplitudes $&lt;10\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ over length scales of $1.5$-$2.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ regardless of the assumed dark halo component. We show that accounting for such covariance can result in a $\sim 50$ per cent lower total mass estimate for the Milky Way than when it is neglected, and that the statistical uncertainty associated with the covariance is comparable to or exceeds the total systematic uncertainty budget. Our findings motivate including more detailed treatment of rotation curve covariance in future analyses.</description>

      <title>Kpc-Scale Neutral Iron K$\alpha$ Emission in the Starburst-AGN NGC 4945: a Relic AGN Outflow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 4945 contains a well-known heavily obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN) at its core, with prior reports of strong nuclear and off-nuclear neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission due to the AGN activity. We report the discovery of very extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission with the XMM-Newton EPIC pn in a $\sim5$ kpc by $\sim10$ kpc region that is misaligned with the plane of the inclined optical galaxy disk by $\sim60$ degrees in projection. After a careful consideration of the crowded center of the galaxy and numerous unresolved hard X-ray sources present, we estimate that $\sim15$% of the Fe K$\alpha$ is extended on kpc-sized scales. The overall size and misalignment of the region follows an unusual pattern of radio polarization that is not typical of starbursts or normal disk galaxies but has been interpreted as possibly due to AGN activity. We suggest that the extended Fe K$\alpha$ emission arose from a period of AGN eruption several million years ago - a relic of a past AGN ejection episode.</description>

      <title>Are High $\Sigma_1$ Massive Blue Spiral Galaxies Rejuvenated Systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiescent galaxies generally possess denser cores than star-forming galaxies with similar mass. As a measurement of the core density, the central stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc ($\Sigma_1$) was thus suggested to be closely related to galaxy quenching. Massive star-forming galaxies with high $\Sigma_1$ do not fit into this picture. To understand the origin of such galaxies, we compare the spatially-resolved stellar population and star formation properties of massive ($ &gt; 10^{10.5}{\rm M}_{\odot}$) blue spiral galaxies with high and low $\Sigma_1$, divided by $\Sigma_1 = 10^{9.4} M_\odot \, {\rm kpc}^{-2}$, based on the final release of MaNGA IFU data. We find that both high $\Sigma_1$ and low $\Sigma_1$ blue spirals show large diversities in stellar population and star formation properties. Despite the diversities, high $\Sigma_1$ blue spirals are statistically different from the low $\Sigma_1$ ones. Specifically, the radial profiles of the luminosity-weighted age and Mgb/${\rm \langle Fe \rangle}$ show that high $\Sigma_1$ blue spirals consist of a larger fraction of galaxies with younger and less $\alpha$-element enhanced centers than their low $\Sigma_1$ counterparts, $\sim 55\%$ versus $\sim 30\%$. The galaxies with younger centers mostly have higher central specific star formation rates, which still follow the spaxel-based star formation main sequence relation though. Examinations of the H$\alpha$ velocity field and the optical structures suggest that galactic bars or galaxy interactions should be responsible for the rejuvenation of these galaxies. The remaining $\sim 45\% $ of high $\Sigma_1$ blue spirals are consistent with the inside-out growth scenario.</description>

      <title>INvestigations of massive Filaments ANd sTar formation (INFANT). I. Core Identification and Core Mass Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filamentary structures are ubiquitously found in high-mass star-forming clouds. To investigate the relationship between filaments and star formation, we carry out the INFANT (INvestigations of massive Filaments ANd sTar formation) survey, a multi-scale, multi-wavelength survey of massive filamentary clouds with ALMA band 3/band 6 and VLA K band. In this first paper, we present the ALMA band 6 continuum observations toward a sample of 8 high-mass star forming filaments. We covered each target with approximately rectangular mosaic field of view with two 12-m array configurations, achieving an angular resolution of $\sim$0.6" (2700 AU at 4.5 kpc) and a continuum rms of $\sim$0.1 mJy/beam ($\sim$0.06 Msun in gas mass assuming 15 K). We identify cores using the getsf and astrodendro and find the former is more robust in terms of both identification and measuring flux densities. We identify in total 183 dense cores (15--36 cores in each cloud) and classify their star formation states via outflow and warm gas tracers. The protostellar cores are statistically more massive than the prestellar cores, possibly indicating further accretion onto cores after formation of protostars. For the high-mass end ($M_\text{core}$ $&gt;$ 1.5 Msun) of the core mass function (CMF) we derive a power-law index of $-$1.15 $\pm$ 0.12 for the whole sample, and $-$1.70 $\pm$ 0.25 for the prestellar population. We also find a steepening trend in CMF with cloud evolution ($-$0.89 $\pm$ 0.15 for the young group v.s. $-$1.44 $\pm$ 0.25 for the evolved group) and discuss its implication for cluster formation.</description>

      <title>Pressure Balance and Energy Budget of the Nuclear Superbubble of NGC 3079</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superbubbles in the nuclear region of galaxies could be produced by the AGN or nuclear starburst via different driving forces. We report analysis of the multi-wavelength data of the kpc-scale nuclear superbubble in NGC 3079, in order to probe the mechanisms driving the expansion of the superbubble. Based on the Chandra X-ray observations, we derive the hot gas thermal pressure inside the bubble, which is about one order of magnitude higher than that of the warm ionized gas traced by optical lines. We derive a [C II]-based star formation rate of ${\rm SFR}\sim1.3\rm~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ from the nuclear region using the SOFIA/FIFI-LS observation. This SFR infers a radiation pressure toward the bubble shells much lower than the thermal pressure of the gases. The VLA radio image infers a magnetic pressure at the northeast cap above the superbubble less than the thermal pressure of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble, but has a clearly larger extension. The magnetic field may thus still help to reconcile the expansion of the bubble. The observed thermal energy of the hot gas enclosed in the bubble requires an energy injection rate of $\gtrsim10^{42}\rm~ergs~s^{-1}$ within the bubble's dynamical age, which is probably larger than the power provided by the current nuclear starburst and the parsec-scale jet. If this is true, stronger past AGN activity may provide an alternative energy source to drive the observed bubble expansion.</description>

      <title>Direct collapse supermassive black holes from relic particle decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of high-redshift supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via the direct collapse of baryonic clouds, where the necessary formation of molecular hydrogen is supressed by a Lyman-Werner (LW) photon background from relic particle decay. We improve on existing studies by dynamically simulating the collapse, accounting for the adiabatic contraction of the DM halo, as well as the in-situ production of the LW photons within the cloud which reduce the impact of the cloud's shielding. We find a viable parameter space where the decay of either some or all of the dark matter could successfully lead to the direct collapse of a SMBH.</description>

      <title>Recovery of the low- and high-mass end slopes of the IMF in massive early-type galaxies using detailed elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation in the early Universe has left its imprint on the chemistry of observable stars in galaxies. We derive elemental abundances and the slope of the low-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) for a sample of 25 very massive galaxies, separated into brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) and their massive satellites. The elemental abundances of BGCs and their satellites are similar, but for some elements, satellite galaxies show a correlation with the global velocity dispersion. Using a subset of derived elemental abundances, we model the star formation histories of these galaxies with chemical evolution models, and predict the high-mass end slope of the IMF and star formation timescales. The high-mass end IMF slope of the satellite galaxies correlates with the global velocity dispersion. The low- and the high-mass end IMF slopes are weakly correlated in a general sense that top heavy IMFs are paired with bottom heavy IMFs. Our results do not necessarily imply that the IMF was simultaneously bottom and top heavy. Instead, our findings can be considered consistent with a temporal variation in the IMF, where, for massive galaxies, the high-mass end IMF slope is representative of the very early age and the low-mass end slope of the later star formation. The small but noticeable differences between the BCGs and the satellites in terms of their elemental abundances and IMF slopes, together with their stellar kinematical properties, suggest somewhat different formation pathways, where BCGs experience more major, gas-free mergers.</description>

      <title>KRATOS: A large suite of N-body simulations to interpret the stellar kinematics of LMC-like discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present KRATOS, a comprehensive suite of 28 open access pure N-body simulations of isolated and interacting LMC-like galaxies, to study the formation of substructures in their disc after the interaction with an SMC-mass galaxy. The primary objective of this paper is to provide theoretical models that help interpreting the formation of general structures of an LMC-like galaxy under various tidal interaction scenarios. This is the first paper of a series that will be dedicated to the analysis of this complex interaction. Simulations are grouped in 11 sets of at most three configurations each containing: (1) a control model of an isolated LMC-like galaxy; (2) a model that contains the interaction with an SMC-mass galaxy, and; (3) the most realistic configuration where both an SMC-mass and MW-mass galaxies may interact with the LMC-like galaxy. In each simulation, we analyse the orbital history between the three galaxies and examine the morphological and kinematic features of the LMC-like disc galaxy throughout the interaction. This includes investigating the disc scale height and velocity maps. When a bar develops, our analysis involves characterising its strength, length, off-centeredness and pattern speed. The diverse outcomes found in the KRATOS simulations, including the presence of bars, warped discs, or various spiral arm shapes (along with the high spatial, temporal, and mass resolution used), demonstrate their capability to explore a range of LMC-like galaxy morphologies. Those directly correspond to distinct disc kinematic maps, making them well-suited for a first-order interpretation of the LMC's kinematic maps. From the simulations we note that tidal interactions can: boost the disc scale height; both destroy and create bars, and; naturally explain the off-center stellar bars. The bar length and pattern speed of long-lived bars are not appreciably altered by the interaction.</description>

      <title>The CO-to-H$_2$ Conversion Factor in the Central Molecular Zone of the Milky Way using CO isotopologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed correlation analyses between the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO $J=$1-0 line intensities in order to derive the variability of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($X_{\rm CO, iso}$) in the central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. New high-resolution $X_{\rm CO, iso}$ maps at a resolution of $\sim 30$" and the longitude-velocity diagram (LVD) at resolution $\sim 30$" $ \times\ 2$ km s$^{-1}$ are presented using the $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO archival survey data obtained by the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. We revealed the variation of $X_{\rm CO, iso}$ in the CMZ within the range of $X_{\rm CO, iso} \sim (0.2-1.3) \times 10^{20}\ {\rm cm^{-2}\ (K\ km\ s^{-1})^{-1}}$, if we assume the normalization value of $0.59 \times 10^{20}\ {\rm cm^{-2}\ (K\ km\ s^{-1})^{-1}}$. The mean value is obtained as $X_{\rm CO, iso} = (0.48 \pm 0.15) \times 10^{20}\ {\rm cm^{-2}\ (K\ km\ s^{-1})^{-1}}$ in the CMZ of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A MUSE View of the Core of the Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxy Malin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The central region of the Giant Low Surface Brightness galaxy Malin 1 has long been known to have a complex morphology with evidence of a bulge, disc, and potentially a bar hosting asymmetric star formation. In this work, we use VLT/MUSE data to resolve the central region of Malin 1 in order to determine its structure. Methods. We use careful light profile fitting in every image slice of the datacube to create wavelength-dependent models of each morphological component, from which we could cleanly extract their spectra. We then used the kinematics and emission line properties from these spectra to better understand the nature of each component extracted from our model fit. Results. We report the detection of a pair of distinct sources at the centre of this galaxy with a separation of ~1.05", which corresponds to a separation on sky of ~1.9 kpc. The radial velocity data of each object confirms that they both lie in the kinematic core of the galaxy, and analysis of the emission lines reveals that the central compact source is more consistent with being ionized by star formation and/or a LINER, while the off-centre compact source lies closer to the separation between star-forming galaxies and AGN. Conclusions. This evidence suggests that the centre of Malin 1 hosts either a bar with asymmetric star formation or two distinct components in which the off-centre compact source could either be a star-forming clump containing one or more star clusters that is in the process of falling into the core of the galaxy and which will eventually merge with the central NSC, or a clump of gas infalling into the centre of the galaxy from either outside or from the disc and triggering star formation there.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: An extremely nitrogen-loud and chemically stratified galaxy at $z\sim 5.55$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073, a galaxy at $z=5.55$ which was previously confirmed to host an overmassive active black hole, by leveraging the detection of about 40 emission lines, combining JWST/NIRSpec observations and ground-based (VLT/VIMOS) data. By using rest-frame UV emission lines, which trace high-density ($\sim 10^5~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and highly ionized gas, we derived an abundance ratio of $\rm log(N/O) = 0.46^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$. At an estimated metallicity of $0.2~Z_{\odot}$, this is the most extreme nitrogen-rich object found by JWST thus far. In comparison, the relative carbon abundance derived from the rest-frame UV emission lines is $\rm log(C/O) = -0.30^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$, which is not significantly higher than those in local galaxies and stars with similar metallicities. We also detected coronal lines, including [FeVII]$\lambda 6087$ and potentially [FeXIV]$\lambda 5303$. We inferred a high Fe abundance of $\rm [Fe/O] \gtrsim 0.1$. Overall, the chemical abundance pattern of GS\_3073 is compatible with enrichment by super-massive stars with $M_* \gtrsim 1000~M_\odot$, ejecta from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, or winds from Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, although the WR scenario is less likely. Interestingly, when using optical emission lines which trace lower density ($\sim 10^3~{\rm cm}^{-3}$) and lower ionization gas, we found a sub-solar N/O ratio. We interpret the difference in N/O derived from UV lines and optical lines as evidence for a stratified system, where the inner and denser region is both more chemically enriched and more ionized. Taking this luminous, well-studied system as a benchmark, our results suggest that nitrogen loudness in high-$z$ galaxies is confined to the central, dense, and highly ionized region of the galaxy, while the bulk of the galaxy evolves more normally.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the Origin of Detectable Cataclysmic Variables in Globular Clusters: Testing the Importance of Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03796</link>

Abstract: Based on the current detectable cataclysmic variable (CV) population in Galactic globular clusters (GCs), we show that there is not a clear relation between the number of sources per unit of mass and the stellar encounter rate, the cluster mass, or the cluster central density. If any, only in the case of core-collapsed GCs could there be an anticorrelation with the stellar encounter rate. Our findings contrast with previous studies where clear positive correlations were identified. Our results suggest that correlations between faint X-ray sources, from which often conclusions for the CV population are drawn, and the GC parameters considered here, are likely influenced by other type of X-ray sources, including other types of compact binaries, which have X-ray luminosities similar to CVs. The findings presented here also suggest that the role of primordial systems is more important than previously believed and that dynamical formation has less influence in the current detectable CV population. The long-standing paradigm that GCs are efficient factories of CVs formed via dynamical interactions does not seem to be supported by current observations.</description>

      <title>EC 19529-4430: SALT identifies the most carbon- and metal-poor extreme helium star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EC 19529-4430 was identified as a helium-rich star in the Edinburgh-Cape Survey of faint-blue objects and subsequently resolved as a metal-poor extreme helium (EHe) star in the SALT survey of chemically-peculiar hot subdwarfs. This paper presents a fine analysis of the SALT high-resolution spectrum. EC 19529-4430 has $T_{\rm eff} = 20\,700 \pm250$\,K, $\log g /{\rm cm\,s^{-2}} = 3.49\pm0.03$, and an overall metallicity some 1.3 dex below solar; surface hydrogen is $\approx 0.5\%$ by number. The surface CNO ratio 1:100:8 implies that the surface consists principally of CNO-processed helium and makes EC 19529-4430 the coolest known carbon-poor and nitrogen-rich EHe star. Metal-rich analogues include V652 Her and GALEX J184559.8-413827. Kinematically, its retrograde orbit indicates membership of the galactic halo. No pulsations were detected in TESS photometry and there is no evidence for a binary companion. EC 19529-4430 most likely formed from the merging of two helium white dwarfs, which themselves formed as a binary system some 11 Gyr ago.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the effective temperature scale of red giant branch stellar models: the case of the metal-poor halo giant HD 122563</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is plenty of evidence in the literature of significant discrepancies between the observations and models of metal-poor red giant branch stars, in particular regarding the effective temperature, teff, scale. We revisit the benchmark star HD 122563 using the most recent observations from Gaia Data Release 3, to investigate if these new constraints may help in resolving this discrepancy. We review the most recent spectroscopic determinations of the metallicity of HD 122563 [Fe/H], and provide a new assessment of its fundamental parameters, i.e. bolometric luminosity, teff, surface gravity, plus a photometric determination of its metal content. Using these constraints, we compare the position of the star in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram with various recent sets of stellar evolution tracks. The H-R diagram analysis reveals a significant disagreement between observed and theoretical teff values, when adopting the most recent spectroscopic estimate of [Fe/H]. On the other hand, by using the photometric determination of [Fe/H] some of the selected sets of stellar tracks appear in fair agreement with observations. The sets with discrepant teff can be made to agree with observations either by modifying the prescription adopted to calculate the models' outer boundary conditions, and/or by reducing the adopted value of the mixing length parameter with respect to the solar-calibration. A definitive assessment of whether the teff scale of metal-poor stellar red giant branch models is consistent with observations requires an even more accurate determination of the fundamental parameters of HD 122563 and also a larger sample of calibrators. From the theoretical side, it is crucial to minimise the current uncertainties in the treatment (boundary conditions, temperature gradient) of the outer layers of stellar models with convective envelopes.</description>

      <title>Extending the Chemical Reach of the H3 Survey: Detailed Abundances of the Dwarf-galaxy Stellar Stream Wukong/LMS-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first detailed chemical-abundance analysis of stars from the dwarf-galaxy stellar stream Wukong/LMS-1 covering a wide metallicity range ($-3.5 &lt; \rm[Fe/H] \lesssim -1.3$). We find abundance patterns that are effectively indistinguishable from the bulk of Indus and Jhelum, a pair of smaller stellar streams proposed to be dynamically associated with Wukong/LMS-1. We confirmed a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star ($\rm[C/Fe] &gt; +0.7$ and $\rm[Fe/H] \sim -2.9$) in Wukong/LMS-1 with strong enhancements in Sr, Y, and Zr, which is peculiar given its solar-level [Ba/Fe]. Wukong/LMS-1 stars have high abundances of $\alpha$ elements up to $\rm[Fe/H] \gtrsim -2$, which is expected for relatively massive dwarfs. Towards the high-metallicity end, Wukong/LMS-1 becomes $\alpha$-poor, revealing that it probably experienced fairly standard chemical evolution. We identified a pair of N- and Na-rich stars in Wukong/LMS-1, reminiscent of multiple populations in globular clusters. This indicates that this dwarf galaxy contained at least one globular cluster that was completely disrupted in addition to two intact ones previously known to be associated with Wukong/LMS-1, which is possibly connected to similar evidence found in Indus. From these $\geq$3 globular clusters, we estimate the total mass of Wukong/LMS-1 to be ${\approx}10^{10} M_\odot$, representing ${\sim}1$% of the present-day Milky Way. Finally, the [Eu/Mg] ratio in Wukong/LMS-1 continuously increases with metallicity, making this the first example of a dwarf galaxy where the production of $r$-process elements is clearly dominated by delayed sources, presumably neutron-star mergers.</description>

      <title>PAC VI. High Satellite Fraction of Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs (PAC) approach developed in Xu et al. (2022b) has the advantage of making full use of spectroscopic and deeper photometric surveys. With the merits of PAC, the excess surface density $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ of neighboring galaxies can be measured down to stellar mass $10^{10.80}\,M_{\odot}$ around quasars at redshift $0.8&lt;z_{\rm{s}}&lt;1.0$, with the data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys. We find that $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ generally increases quite steeply with the decrease of the separation. Using subhalo abundance matching method, we can accurately model the $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ both on small and large scales. We show that the steep increase of the $\bar{n}_2w_{{\rm{p}}}$ towards the quasars requires that a large fraction $f_{\mathrm{sate}}=0.29_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$ of quasars should be satellites in massive halos, and find that this fraction measurement is insensitive to the assumptions of our modeling. This high satellite fraction indicates that the subhalos have nearly the same probability to host quasars as the halos for the same (infall) halo mass, and the large scale environment has negligible effect on the quasar activity. We show that even with this high satellite fraction, each massive halo on average does not host more than one satellite quasar due to the sparsity of quasars.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: II. the ACA 1.3 mm continuum source catalog and the assembly of dense gas in massive star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging the high resolution, high sensitivity, and wide frequency coverage of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the QUARKS survey, standing for "Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures", is observing 139 massive star-forming clumps at ALMA Band 6 ($\lambda\sim$ 1.3 mm). This paper introduces the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data. Combining multi-wavelength data, we provide the first edition of QUARKS atlas, offering insights into the multiscale and multiphase interstellar medium in high-mass star formation. The ACA 1.3 mm catalog includes 207 continuum sources that are called ACA sources. Their gas kinetic temperatures are estimated using three formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) transitions with a non-LTE radiation transfer model, and the mass and density are derived from a dust emission model. The ACA sources are massive (16-84 percentile values of 6-160 $M_{\odot}$), gravity-dominated ($M\propto R^{1.1}$) fragments within massive clumps, with supersonic turbulence ($\mathcal{M}&gt;1$) and embedded star-forming protoclusters. We find a linear correlation between the masses of the fragments and the massive clumps, with a ratio of 6% between the two. When considering the fragments as representative of dense gas, the ratio indicates a dense gas fraction (DGF) of 6%, although with a wide scatter ranging from 1% to 10%. If we consider the QUARKS massive clumps to be what is observed at various scales, then the size-independent DGF indicates a self-similar fragmentation or collapsing mode in protocluster formation. With the ACA data over four orders of magnitude of luminosity-to-mass ratio ($L/M$), we find that the DGF increases significantly with $L/M$, which indicates clump evolutionary stage. We observed a limited fragmentation at the subclump scale, which can be explained by dynamic global collapse process.</description>

      <title>Inferring properties of dark galactic halos using strongly lensed gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can be deflected, similarly to electromagnetic (EM) waves, by massive objects through the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. The importance of gravitational lensing for GW astronomy is becoming increasingly apparent in the GW detection era, in which nearly 100 events have already been detected. As current ground-based interferometers reach their design sensitivities, it is anticipated that these detectors may observe a few GW signals that are strongly lensed by the dark halos of intervening galaxies or galaxy clusters. Analysing strong lensing effects on GW signals is, thus, becoming important to understand the lens' properties and correctly infer the intrinsic GW source parameters. However, one cannot accurately infer lens parameters for complex lens models with only GW observations because there are strong degeneracies between the parameters of lensed waveforms. In this paper, we discuss how to conduct parameter estimation of strongly lensed GW signals and infer the lens parameters using additional EM information, including the lens galaxy's axis ratio and the GW source-hosting galaxy's lensed images. We find that for simple spherically symmetric lens models, the lens parameters can be well recovered using only GW information. On the other hand, recovering the lens parameters requires systems in which four or more GW images are detected with additional EM observations for non-axially symmetric lens models. Combinations of GW and EM observations can further improve the inference of the lens parameters.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are luminous millisecond-duration radio pulses with extragalactic origin, which were discovered more than a decade ago. Despite the numerous samples, the physical origin of FRBs remains poorly understood. FRBs have been thought to originate from young magnetars or accreting compact objects (COs). Massive stars or COs are predicted to be embedded in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The dense disk absorbs FRBs severely, making them difficult to observe. However, progenitors ejecta or outflow feedback from the accreting COs interact with the disk material to form a cavity. The existence of the cavity can reduce the absorption by the dense disk materials, making FRBs escape. Here we investigate the production and propagation of FRBs in AGN disks and find that the AGN environments lead to the following unique observational properties, which can be verified in future observation. First, the dense material in the disk can cause large dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM). Second, the toroidal magnetic field in the AGN disk can cause Faraday conversion. Third, during the shock breakout, DM and RM show non-power-law evolution patterns over time. Fourth, for accreting-powered models, higher accretion rates lead to more bright bursts in AGN disks, accounting for up to 1% of total bright repeating FRBs.</description>
