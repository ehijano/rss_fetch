      <title>The eventful life journey of galaxy clusters. I. Impact of DM halo and ICM properties on their full assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Galaxy clusters assemble over gigayears in a very anisotropic environment, which causes a remarkable diversity in their mass assembly histories (MAH).
  Aims. In this work, we have aimed to understand how the present-day properties of the dark matter halo and the intracluster medium are related to the whole evolution of these structures.
  Methods. To this end, we analysed a $\Lambda$CDM hydrodynamical+$N$-Body simulation of a $(100 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc})^3$ volume, containing over 30 clusters and 300 groups, and looked at the individual and the stacked MAHs (determined from complete merger trees) in relation to properties of the DM haloes and the ICM at fixed cosmic time (indicators of assembly state).
  Results. The ensemble MAHs are well separated when stacked in bins of these indicators, yielding clear dependencies of evolutionary properties (such as formation redshift) on fix-time halo properties. Additionally, we find that different indicators are informative about distinct epochs of accretion. Finally, by summarising the complex MAH diversity with two parameters, we describe how different indicators bring complementary information in different directions of this biparametric space. Overall, halo spin and a combined indicator appear to be the ones encoding the most information about the MAH.
  Conclusions. The results shown here add up to the idea that the dynamical state of cosmic structures is a multifaceted concept, and warn that single indicators are incapable of capturing the whole complexity of the process. This work sheds light on the nature of this characterisation by untangling precisely when and how several indicators are informative about. In turn, this can provide clues to better constrain the MAH of observed structures.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple and efficient filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>Weighted FFT estimators for 1D and 3D correlations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlations in the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest, both as a function of line of sight separation (1D) and 3D separation, provide a unique window to the distribution of matter at redshifts not accessible by current galaxy surveys. While optimal quadratic estimators have been used to measure 1D correlations, they are computationally expensive and difficult to extend to 3D analyses. On the other hand, estimators based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) are significantly faster, but are affected by missing data in the spectra (masked pixels) and so far have not used pixel weights to reduce the uncertainties in the measurement. In this publication we describe how to compute the window matrix that enables forward-modeling the impact of masked pixels and weights on the FFT-based estimators. We use Gaussian and hydrodynamical simulations with artificially masked pixels to validate the method on the measurement of 1D correlations. Finally, we show that the formalism can be extended to model the impact on 3D correlations, in particular on the cross-spectrum, the correlation of 1D Fourier modes as a function of transverse separation. This work will enable more precise clustering measurements with the Ly$\alpha$ forest dataset recently collected by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).</description>

      <title>Vlasov Perturbation Theory applied to $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the framework of Vlasov Perturbation Theory (VPT) to the two-loop matter power spectrum within $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. The main difference to Standard Perturbation Theory (SPT) arises from taking the velocity dispersion tensor into account, and the resulting screening of the backreaction of UV modes renders loop integrals cutoff-independent. VPT is informed about non-perturbative small scale dynamics via the average value of the dispersion generated by shell-crossing, which impacts the evolution of perturbations on weakly non-linear scales. When using an average dispersion from halo models, the VPT power spectrum agrees with the one from the simulation, up to differences from missing three-loop contributions. Alternatively, treating the average dispersion as free parameter we find a remarkably stable prediction of the matter power spectrum from collisionless dynamics at percent level for a wide range of the dispersion scale. We quantify the impact of truncating the Vlasov hierarchy for the cumulants of the phase-space distribution function, finding that the two-loop matter power spectrum is robust to neglecting third and higher cumulants. Finally, we introduce and validate a simplified fast scheme fVPT that can be easily incorporated into existing codes and is as numerically efficient as SPT.</description>

      <title>Resilience and implications of adiabatic CMB cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate potential deviations from the standard adiabatic evolution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature, $T_{\rm CMB}(z)$, using the latest Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect measurements and molecular line excitation data, covering a combined redshift range of $0 &lt; z \lesssim 6$. We follow different approaches. First, we reconstruct the redshift evolution of $T_{\rm CMB}(z)$ in a model-independent way using Gaussian Process regression. The tightest constraints come from SZ measurements at $z &lt; 1$, while molecular line data at $z &gt; 3$ yield broader uncertainties. By combining both datasets, we find good consistency with the standard evolution across the full analysed redshift range, inferring a present-day CMB monopole temperature of $T_0 = 2.744 \pm 0.019$ K. Next, we test for deviations from the standard scaling by adopting the parameterisation $T_{\rm CMB}(z) = T_0(1+z)^{1-\beta}$, where $\beta$ quantifies departures from adiabaticity, with $\beta = 0$ corresponding to the standard scenario. In this framework, we use Gaussian Process reconstruction to test the consistency of $\beta = 0$ across the full redshift range and perform $\chi^2$ minimisation techniques to determine the best-fit values of $T_0$ and $\beta$. In both cases, we find good consistency with the standard temperature-redshift relation. The $\chi^2$-minimisation analysis yields best-fit values of $\beta = -0.0106 \pm 0.0124$ and $T_0 = 2.7276 \pm 0.0095$ K, in excellent agreement with both $\beta = 0$ and independent direct measurements of $T_0$ from FIRAS and ARCADE. We discuss the implications of our findings, which offer strong empirical support for the standard cosmological prediction and place tight constraints on a wide range of alternative scenarios of interest in the context of cosmological tensions and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Pressure Parametrization of Dark Energy: First and Second-Order Constraints with Latest Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the pressure $p$ of the dark energy (DE) fluid evolves with the expansion of the Universe, expressed as a function of the scale factor $a$. The corresponding energy density $\rho$ is derived from the continuity equation, resulting in a dynamical equation-of-state parameter $w \equiv p/\rho$ during the late-time expansion of the Universe. The pressure is modeled using a Taylor expansion around the present epoch ($a = 1$), introducing deviations from a cosmological constant within the dynamical dark energy (DDE) framework. At first order, a single new parameter $\Omega_1$ captures linear deviations, while a second-order parameter, $\Omega_2$, accounts for quadratic evolution in the pressure. We constrain the first- and second-order DDE models using multiple observational datasets and compare their performance against $\Lambda$CDM and the CPL parameterization. A joint analysis of Planck CMB, DESI, and DESY5 data yields the strongest evidence for DDE, with a $2.7\sigma$ deviation in the first-order model and over $4\sigma$ in the second-order model, providing strong statistical support for a departure from a cosmological constant. The reconstructed DE evolution in the second-order case reveals a distinctive non-monotonic behavior in both energy density and $w_{\rm DE}(a)$, including clear phantom-crossing phenomena. Notably, the late-time evolution of $w_{\rm DE}(a)$ remains consistent across datasets and shows strong agreement with the CPL parameterization, underscoring the robustness of the pressure-based approach.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the Global 21-cm Signal to Dark Matter-Baryon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With current and upcoming experiments on the horizon, the global 21-cm signal can open up new avenues for probing dark matter (DM) physics at redshifts that are otherwise inaccessible to other observables. This work investigates the effects of elastic scattering between DM and baryons on the global 21-cm signal in two distinct interacting DM (IDM) models: Coulomb-like and velocity-independent interactions. Our analysis incorporates key astrophysical parameters essential for accurately modeling the global signal, including star formation efficiency, escape fraction of ionizing photons, normalization of the X-ray luminosity, the number of Lyman-Werner photons emitted per stellar baryon, the minimum virial temperature of star-forming halos, as well as the IDM particle mass and cross section. We perform a Fisher analysis to forecast the sensitivity of four global 21-cm signal experimental scenarios as probes of DM-baryon scattering. We find that global signal experiments, even at the sensitivity of the current facilities such as EDGES and SARAS3, could improve existing cosmological and astrophysical constraints on DM-baryon scattering. Our results also highlight the degeneracies among the DM-baryon interaction cross section and astrophysical quantities. In particular, degeneracies between the IDM cross section and two astrophysical parameters, the minimum virial temperature, and Lyman-Werner photon production, can significantly impact the DM interaction inference. Conversely, the velocity-independent cross section is found to be insensitive to uncertainties in the X-ray luminosity. These findings underscore the necessity of accurately characterizing the uncertainties in astrophysical parameters to leverage the full potential of the 21-cm global signal experiments in probing IDM physics.</description>

      <title>Decoding the cosmological baryonic fluctuations using localized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: The enigma of the missing baryons poses a prominent and unresolved problem in astronomy. Dispersion measures (DM) serve as a distinctive observable of fast radio bursts (FRBs). They quantify the electron column density along each line of sight and reveal the missing baryons that are described in the Macquart (DM-z) relation. The scatter of this relation is anticipated to be caused by the variation in the cosmic structure. This is not yet statistically confirmed, however. We present statistical evidence that the cosmological baryons fluctuate. Methods: We measured the foreground galaxy number densities around 14 and 13 localized FRBs with the WISE-PS1-STRM and WISE x SCOS photometric redshift galaxy catalog, respectively. The foreground galaxy number densities were determined through a comparison with measured random apertures with a radius of 1 Mpc. Results: We found a positive correlation between the excess of DM that is contributed by the medium outside galaxies (DM_cosmic) and the foreground galaxy number density. The correlation is strong and statistically significant, with median Pearson coefficients of 0.6 and 0.6 and median p-values of 0.012 and 0.032 for the galaxy catalogs, respectively, as calculated with Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the baryonic matter density outside galaxies exceeds its cosmic average along the line of sight to regions with an excess galaxy density, but there are fewer baryons along the line of sight to low-density regions. This is statistical evidence that the ionized baryons fluctuate cosmologically on a characteristic scale of $\lesssim$6 Mpc.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Millennium and Astrid galaxies in effective field theory at the field level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective Field Theory (EFT) modeling is expected to be a useful tool in the era of future higher-redshift galaxy surveys such as DESI-II and Spec-S5 due to its robust description of various large-scale structure tracers. However, large values of EFT bias parameters of higher-redshift galaxies could jeopardize the convergence of the perturbative expansion. In this paper we measure the bias parameters and other EFT coefficients from samples of two types of star-forming galaxies in the state-of-the-art MilleniumTNG and Astrid hydrodynamical simulations. Our measurements are based on the field-level EFT forward model that allows for precision EFT parameter measurements by virtue of cosmic variance cancellation. Specifically, we consider approximately representative samples of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) that are consistent with the observed (angular) clustering and number density of these galaxies at $z=3$. Reproducing the linear biases and number densities observed from existing LAE and LBG data, we find quadratic bias parameters that are roughly consistent with those predicted from the halo model coupled with a simple halo occupation distribution model. We also find non-perturbative velocity contributions (Fingers of God) of a similar size for LBGs to the familiar case of Luminous Red Galaxies. However, these contributions are quite small for LAEs despite their large satellite fraction values of up to $\sim 30\%$. Our results indicate that the effective momentum reach $k_{\rm{Max}}$ at $z=3$ for LAEs (LBGs) will be in the range $0.3-0.6 ~h\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.2-0.8~h\rm{Mpc}^{-1}$), suggesting that EFT will perform well for high redshift galaxy clustering. This work provides the first step toward obtaining realistic simulation-based priors on EFT parameters for LAEs and LBGs.</description>

      <title>CHEX-MATE: exploring the kinematical properties of Planck galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the kinematical properties of the CHEX-MATE (Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation) galaxy cluster sample. [...] We derive cluster mass profiles for 75 clusters using the \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} procedure, which recovers the gravitational potential and the anisotropy profiles from line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of galaxy members. The standard NFW and the Burkert models with flatter cores than NFW both adequately fit the kinematic data, with only marginal statistical preference for one model over the other. An estimation of the mass bias $(1-B_1) = M^{SZ}_{500}/M^{M}_{500} $ is performed from the comparison with SZ-X-ray-calibrated mass estimates, resulting in a value of $ 0.54 \pm 0.11$ when four evidently disturbed clusters are removed from the sample. We assess the dynamical state of the clusters by inferring the Anderson-Darling coefficient $(A^2)$ and the fraction of galaxies in substructures ($f_\text{sub}$). Except for a few cases, we found relatively low values for $A^2$, suggesting that CHEX-MATE clusters are not too far from relaxation. Moreover, no significant trends emerge among $A^2,\,f_\text{sub}$ and the difference between the log-masses estimated by \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} and by SZ-X-ray.
  We study the concentration-mass relation for the sample; despite the large scatter, we observe signs of an increasing trend for large-mass clusters, in agreement with recent theoretical expectations.
  Finally, the analysis of radial anisotropy profiles of member galaxies - stacked in five bins of mass and redshift - reveals that orbits tend to be isotropic at the center and more radial towards the edge, as already found in previous studies. A slight trend of increasing radial orbits at $r_{200}$ is observed in clusters with larger velocity dispersion</description>

      <title>Impact of Galactic non-Gaussian foregrounds on CMB lensing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB has been established as a robust and powerful observable for precision cosmology. However, the impact of Galactic foregrounds, which has been studied less extensively than many other potential systematics, could in principle pose a problem for CMB lensing measurements. These foregrounds are inherently non-Gaussian and hence might mimic the characteristic signal that lensing estimators are designed to measure. We present an analysis that quantifies the level of contamination from Galactic dust in lensing measurements, focusing particularly on measurements with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory. We employ a whole suite of foreground models and study the contamination of lensing measurements with both individual frequency channels and multifrequency combinations. We test the sensitivity of different estimators to the level of foreground non-Gaussianity, and the dependence on sky fraction and multipole range used. We find that Galactic foregrounds do not present a problem for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope experiment (the bias in the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum amplitude remains below $0.3\sigma$). For Simons Observatory, not all foreground models remain below this threshold. Although our results are conservative upper limits, they suggest that further work on characterizing dust biases and determining the impact of mitigation methods is well motivated, especially for the largest sky fractions.</description>

      <title>Abundant Population of Broad H$\alpha$ Emitters in the GOODS-N Field Revealed by CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at z~3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$ emitters with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$ components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher $M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}$-$M_{*}$ relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.</description>

      <title>The Large-scale Environments of Low-luminosity AGNs at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 6$ and Implications for Their Host Dark Matter Halos from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over (15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that $&gt; 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 $h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5$ and $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log (M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and their hosts from scaling relations pairwise residuals: dominance of stellar velocity dispersion and host halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correlations between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies still defy our understanding from both the observational and theoretical perspectives. Here we perform pairwise residual analysis on the latest sample of local inactive galaxies with a uniform calibration of their photometric properties and with dynamically measured masses of their central SMBHs. The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and, possibly host dark matter halo mass $M_{\rm halo}$, appear as the galactic properties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker) correlation with spheroidal (bulge) mass $M_{\rm sph}$, as also corroborated by additional Machine Learning tests. These findings may favour energetic/kinetic feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as the main driver in shaping SMBH scaling relations. Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of kinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in the residuals, although they tend to either favour $M_{\rm sph}$ as the most fundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback kinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix we also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high in $\sigma$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local galaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass discrepancies. Overall, our results suggest that probing the SMBH-galaxy scaling relations in terms of total stellar mass alone may induce biases, and that either current data sets are incomplete, and/or that more insightful modelling is required to fully reproduce observations.</description>

      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Coexistence of Freeze-in Dark Matter and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle dark matter and primordial black holes (PBH) might coexist with appreciable cosmic abundances, with both contributing to the observed dark matter density $\Omega_{\rm DM}$. Large populations of PBH (with $\Omega_{\rm PBH}\sim \Omega_{\rm DM}$) are tightly constrained for PBH heavier than $10^{-11} M_\odot$. However, large fractional abundances with $ f_{\rm PBH}\simeq \Omega_{\rm PBH}/\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim0.01$ are consistent with the limits on PBH for a wide range of PBH masses. Scenarios with significant populations of both particle dark matter and PBH are intriguing. Notably, if the particle dark matter has interactions with the Standard Model, new constraints arise due to pair-annihilations that are enhanced by the PBHs, resulting in dark matter indirect detection constraints on $f_{\rm PBH}$. Here we derive the bounds on mixed scenarios in which PBHs coexist with particle dark matter whose relic abundance is set via freeze-in (``FIMPs''). We show that while the restrictions on $f_{\rm PBH}$ are less constraining for FIMPs than WIMPs, modest bounds still arise for large classes of models. We examine both IR and UV freeze-in scenarios, including the case of ``superheavy'' particle dark matter with PeV scale mass.</description>

      <title>Higgs-like inflation under ACTivated mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses that combine the latest data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with cosmic microwave background observations by BICEP/Keck and Planck, together with the DESI baryon acoustic-baryonic-oscillation (BAO) measurements, have tightened the limits on inflationary scenarios. The joint data set yields a spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ and an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r &lt; 0.038$. This slight upward shift in $n_s$ puts the previously favored Starobinsky model, and the conventional metric Higgs(-like) inflation--based on a quartic potential with a large non-minimal coupling in the Jordan frame--under tension with observations. In metric Higgs-like inflation the attractor behavior makes the predictions remarkably stable against higher-order operators, so modifying $n_s$ through such terms is difficult. In this paper, I show that adding a quadratic mass term to the Jordan-frame potential can raise $n_s$ and restore compatibility with the new data. I also discuss how this mass term can naturally arise from threshold effects in Higgs inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Neutron Stars in Aether Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a relativistic alternative gravity model that behaves like cold dark matter on cosmological scales while predicting the MOND force-law in astrophysical systems. The theory correctly predicts the cosmic microwave background and linear matter power spectra, and the mass discrepancies observed across the Universe. We derive and solve the equations governing neutron stars in Aether Scalar Tensor theory at first-order in slow rotation, finding that the theory predicts approximate universal relations between the moment of inertia and the compactness ($I$--$C$ relations) that differ from their general relativity counterparts. These relations may enable tests of Aether Scalar-Tensor theory using X-ray observations of pulsars and gravitational wave observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Cosmic strings and domain walls of the QCD quark condensate with and without a hidden axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral quark condensate of QCD, which spontaneously breaks the anomalous axial symmetry, gives rise to axionic type global string-wall systems. If a Peccei-Quinn type axion exists in the theory, the axionic strings are in general accompanied by winding of the QCD quark condensate. Depending on the axion model the winding can proceed either in the $\eta'$ or in the pion direction. This determines the structure of fermionic zero modes and the anomaly inflow which has important astrophysical consequences. We point out that $\eta'$ and pion string-wall systems exist in pure QCD, independently of the hidden axion. Strikingly, even if a hidden axion exists, the early cosmology can be entirely dominated by string-wall systems formed by the QCD quark condensate. We also discuss their role in the QCD phase transition and in heavy-ion physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\sim \alpha R^3$, scaled by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being the standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an additive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained by a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the Starobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending the correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and modifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1.9 \times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$.</description>

      <title>Consequences of non-minimal coupling for mass mixing in spontaneous baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between curvature and inflaton field within the \emph{spontaneous baryogenesis} background. We demonstrate that this coupling leads to a significant enhancement in particle production, even for small values of the coupling constant $\xi$. Assuming a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe during the reheating phase, we study the inflaton decay into fermion-antifermion pairs by means of a semiclassical approach, treating fermions as quantized fields and considering the inflaton and the Ricci scalar as classical quantities. We adopt the simplest approach in which the inflaton is minimally coupled to baryons, and non-minimally with gravity. In particular, we solve the equations of motion for the inflaton to first order in perturbation theory, with $\xi$ serving as perturbative parameter. Afterwards, we compute the difference in the number densities of baryons and antibaryons produced through the inflaton decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. We show that the non-minimal coupling term \emph{de facto} increases inflaton mass, letting fermion-antifermion decays be more probable, and thus enhancing the overall baryogenesis process. As a further outcome, we find that the non-minimal Yukawa coupling also leads to a renormalization of the inflaton mass and weakly influences the bounds over the gravitational constant. Finally, since the fermionic fields appear not to be mass eigenstates, we specialize the mass-mixing between them only. To this end, we thus include the effects of mass-mixing and cosmic expansion into our calculations. Physical consequences of baryon production are therefore explored.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results, such as the spectral indices of the scalar and tensor perturbation also have differences with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses from Planck 2018, showing the reason for the different phenomena of Gravitational Wave power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Model-agnostic basis functions for the 2-point correlation function of dark matter in linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider approximating the linearly evolved 2-point correlation function (2pcf) of dark matter $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})$ in a cosmological model with parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ as the linear combination $\xi_{\rm lin}(r;\boldsymbol{\theta})\approx\sum_i\,b_i(r)\,w_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$, where the functions $\mathcal{B}=\{b_i(r)\}$ form a $\textit{model-agnostic basis}$ for the linear 2pcf. This decomposition is important for model-agnostic analyses of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in the nonlinear 2pcf of galaxies that fix $\mathcal{B}$ and leave the coefficients $\{w_i\}$ free. To date, such analyses have made simple but sub-optimal choices for $\mathcal{B}$, such as monomials. We develop a machine learning framework for systematically discovering a $\textit{minimal}$ basis $\mathcal{B}$ that describes $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ near the BAO feature in a wide class of cosmological models. We use a custom architecture, denoted $\texttt{BiSequential}$, for a neural network (NN) that explicitly realizes the separation between $r$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ above. The optimal NN trained on data in which only $\{\Omega_{\rm m},h\}$ are varied in a $\textit{flat}$ $\Lambda$CDM model produces a basis $\mathcal{B}$ comprising $9$ functions capable of describing $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ to $\sim0.6\%$ accuracy in $\textit{curved}$ $w$CDM models varying 7 parameters within $\sim5\%$ of their fiducial, flat $\Lambda$CDM values. Scales such as the peak, linear point and zero-crossing of $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ are also recovered with very high accuracy. We compare our approach to other compression schemes in the literature, and speculate that $\mathcal{B}$ may also encompass $\xi_{\rm lin}(r)$ in modified gravity models near our fiducial $\Lambda$CDM model. Using our basis functions in model-agnostic BAO analyses can potentially lead to significant statistical gains.</description>

Abstract: Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes, arising from the superposition of compact binary coalescence events. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms, and perform Bayesian parameter inference, investigating different prior distributions of the model parameters. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Detectability of Milky Way Satellites with Image Simulations: a Case Study with KiDS</title>

Abstract: Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, which can be detected as resolved satellite systems of the Milky Way, are critical to understanding galaxy formation, evolution, and the nature of dark matter, as they are the oldest, smallest, most metal-poor, and most dark matter-dominated stellar systems known. Quantifying the sensitivity of surveys is essential for understanding their capability and limitations in searching for ultra-faint satellites. In this paper, we present the first study of the image-level observational selection function for Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) based on the Synthetic UniveRses For Surveys (surfs)-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations. We generate mock satellites and simulate images that include resolved stellar populations of the mock satellites and the background galaxies, capturing realistic observational effects such as source blending, photometric uncertainties, and star-galaxy separation. The matched-filter method is applied to recover the injected satellites. We derive the observational selection function of the survey in terms of the luminosity, half-light radius, and heliocentric distance of the satellites. Compared to a catalogue-level simulation as used in previous studies, the image-level simulation provides a more realistic assessment of survey sensitivity, accounting for observational limitations that are neglected in catalogue-level simulations. The image-level simulation shows a detection loss for compact sources with a distance $d \gtrsim 100~\rm kpc$. We argue that this is because compact sources are more likely to be identified as single sources rather than being resolved during the source extraction process.</description>

      <title>Thawing Dark Energy and Massive Neutrinos in Light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analyses have shown that a dynamic dark energy modeled by the CPL parameterization of the dark energy equation of state (EoS) can ease constraints on the total neutrino mass compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. This helps reconcile cosmological and particle physics measurements of $\sum m_\nu$. In this study, we investigate the robustness of this effect by assessing the extent to which the CPL assumption influences the results. We examine how alternative EoS parameterizations - such as Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), and a physically motivated thawing parameterization that reproduces the behavior of various scalar field models - affect estimates of $\sum m_\nu$. Although both the BA and JBP parameterizations relax the constraints similarly to the CPL model, the JBP parameterization still excludes the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy at $\sim 2.1\;\sigma$ with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.096$~eV. The thawing parameterization excludes the inverted hierarchy at $\sim 3.3\sigma$ and yields tighter constraints, comparable to those of the $\Lambda$CDM model, with $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.071$~eV. Our analysis also reveals that the preference for unphysical negative neutrino masses is significantly reduced in all models considered. Finally, we show that the thawing model can be mapped into the BA and JBP $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, with the apparent preference for the phantom regime actually supporting quintessence (non-phantom) models.</description>

      <title>Late-time growth weakly affects the significance of high-redshift massive galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed massive galaxies at very high redshift ($z\simeq 7-15$). The question of whether the existence of such galaxies is expected in the corresponding JWST surveys has received a lot of attention, though the answer straddles areas of cosmology and complex astrophysical details of high-redshift galaxy formation. The growth rate of density fluctuations determines the amplitude of overdensities that collapse to form galaxies. Late-time modifications of growth, combined with measurements at both $z\sim 1$ from large-scale structure and $z\sim 1000$ from the cosmic microwave background, affect the predictions for the abundance of first galaxies in the universe. In this paper, we point out that the late-time growth rate of structure affects the statistical significance of high-redshift, high-mass objects very weakly. Consequently, if the existence and abundance of these objects are confirmed to be unexpected, the variations in the late-time growth history are unlikely to explain these anomalies.</description>

      <title>Cosmic filament spin -- I: a comparative study in observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the cosmic web, filaments play a crucial role in connecting walls to clusters and also act as an important stage for galaxy formation and evolution. Recent observational studies claim that filaments have spin. In this study, we examined the potential impact of diversity in filament identification algorithms and galaxy survey datasets on the quantification of filament spin. The results of this study demonstrate qualitative agreement with previous research, suggesting that a reliable filament spin signal is detectable when the viewing angle of filament spine larger than 80 degrees under a rough estimation. The detected filament spin signal is intricately linked to the viewing angle, dynamic temperature, etc. The quantitative difference of filament spin signal among samples is slightly dependent on the filament identification algorithms, while the value is relatively greater dependent on the redshift space distortion effect in the galaxy sample.</description>

      <title>Cosmic filament spin -- II: filament spin and its impact on galaxy spin-filament alignment in a cosmological simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observational studies have reported that cosmic filaments on the megaparsec scale exhibit rotational motion. Subsequent simulation studies have shown qualitative agreement with these findings, but quantitative discrepancies remain due to differences in data and methods, which require verification. To address this issue, we adopt the same methodology as used in the observations to identify filament spin from the galaxy distribution constructed from a hydrodynamic simulation. Using the same approach to measure filament spin, we find that the simulation results closely match the observational findings, with only minor discrepancies arising from slight differences in the fraction of filaments classified as dynamically cold or hot based on their dynamic temperature. Additionally, an analysis of how filament spin affects the galaxy spin-filament correlation shows that filaments with strong spin signals and dynamically cold have a greater impact on the galaxy spin-filament correlation than those with weaker spin signals and dynamically hot filaments. These results not only provide further evidence that cosmic filaments exhibit spin, but also highlight the importance of this rotation in the acquisition of angular momentum by individual galaxies. Future studies exploring the influence of filament spin on galaxy spin may shed light on the physical origins of filaments and the angular momentum of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Time-Dependent Instrumental Noise for LISA SGWB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions: from weak to strong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) during a cosmological first-order phase transition (PT) using the recently introduced Higgsless approach to numerically simulate the fluid motion induced by the PT. We present for the first time GW spectra sourced by bulk fluid motion in the aftermath of strong first-order PTs ($\alpha = 0.5$), alongside weak ($\alpha = 0.0046$) and intermediate ($\alpha = 0.05$) PTs, previously considered in the literature. We find that, for intermediate and strong PTs, the kinetic energy in our simulations decays, following a power law in time. The decay is potentially determined by non-linear dynamics and hence related to the production of vorticity. We show that the assumption that the source is stationary in time, characteristic of compressional motion in the linear regime (sound waves), agrees with our numerical results for weak PTs, since in this case the kinetic energy does not decay with time. We then provide a theoretical framework that extends the stationary assumption to one that accounts for the time evolution of the source: as a result, the GW energy density is no longer linearly increasing with the source duration, but proportional to the integral over time of the squared kinetic energy fraction. This effectively reduces the linear growth rate of the GW energy density and allows to account for the period of transition from the linear to the non-linear regimes of the fluid perturbations. We validate the novel theoretical model with the results of simulations and provide templates for the GW spectrum for a broad range of PT parameters.</description>

      <title>Signatures of linearized gravity in atom interferometers: A simplified computational framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, general relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically motivated scenarios: (i) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and (ii) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources (e.g., a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

      <title>Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &lt;= z &lt;= 3.61 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst population from the first CHIME/FRB catalog with the Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic redshift distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs as a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the redshift distribution of the CHIME/FRB catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population, i.e. intrinsic redshift distribution of FRB. Taking uncertainties within the observational data and selection effects into consideration, we obtained that the redshift distribution of FRBs is significantly delayed with respect to that of the star formation history.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show for the first time that warm inflation is feasible with Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions alone. Our model consists of a minimal extension of the SM by a single scalar inflaton field with an axion-like coupling to gluons and a monomial potential. The effects of light fermions, which were previously argued to render warm inflation with the SM impossible, are alleviated by Hubble dilution of their chiral chemical potentials. Our model only features one adjustable combination of parameters and accommodates all inflationary observables. We briefly discuss implications for axion experiments, dark matter, and the strong CP-problem.</description>
