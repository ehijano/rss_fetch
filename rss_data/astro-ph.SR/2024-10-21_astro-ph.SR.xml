      <title>The High-resolution Accretion Disks of Embedded protoStars (HADES) simulations. I. Impact of Protostellar Magnetic Fields on the Accretion Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How embedded, actively accreting low-mass protostars accrete their mass is still greatly debated. Observations are now piecing together the puzzle of embedded protostellar accretion, in particular with new facilities in the near-infrared. However, high-resolution theoretical models are still lacking, with a stark paucity of detailed simulations of these early phases. Here we present high-resolution non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of a Solar mass protostar accreting at rates exceeding 10$^{-6} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We show the results of the accretion flow for four different protostellar magnetic fields, 10 G, 500 G, 1 kG, and 2 kG, combined with a disk magnetic field. For weaker (10 G and 500 G) protostar magnetic fields, accretion occurs via a turbulent boundary layer mode, with disk material impacting across the protostellar surface. In the 500 G model, the presence of a magnetically dominated outflow focuses the accretion towards the equator, slightly enhancing and ordering the accretion. For kG magnetic fields, the disk becomes truncated due to the protostellar dipole and exhibits magnetospheric accretion, with the 2 kG model having accretion bursts induced by the interchange instability. We present bolometric light curves for the models and find that they reproduce observations of Class I protostars from YSOVAR, with high bursts followed by an exponential decay possibly being a signature of instability-driven accretion. Finally, we present the filling fractions of accretion and find that 90\% of the mass is accreted in a surface area fraction of 10-20\%. These simulations will be extended in future work for a broader parameter space, with their high resolution and high temporal spacing able to explore a wide range of interesting protostellar physics.</description>

      <title>Classification of Wolf Rayet stars using Ensemble-based Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a robust Machine Learning classifier model utilizing the eXtreme-Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm for improved classification of Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars based on Infrared (IR) colors and positional attributes. For our study, we choose an extensive dataset of 6555 stellar objects (from 2MASS and AllWISE data releases) lying in the Milky Way (MW) with available photometric magnitudes of different types including WR stars. Our XGB classifier model can accurately (with an 86\% detection rate) identify a sufficient number of WR stars against a large sample of non-WR sources. The XGB model outperforms other ensemble classifier models such as the Random Forest. Also, using the XGB algorithm, we develop a WR sub-type classifier model that can differentiate the WR subtypes from the non-WR sources with a high model accuracy ($&gt;60\%$). Further, we apply both XGB-based models to a selection of 6457 stellar objects with unknown object types, detecting 58 new WR star candidates and predicting sub-types for 10 of them. The identified WR sources are mainly located in the Local spiral arm of the MW and mostly lie in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Low-latitude magnetic flux emergence on rapidly rotating solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides a dense coverage of their high latitudes by starspots, rapidly rotating cool stars also display low-latitude spots in Doppler images, although generally with a lower coverage. In contrast, flux emergence models of fast-rotating stars predict strong poleward deflection of radially rising magnetic flux as the Coriolis effect dominates over buoyancy, leaving a spot-free band around the equator. To resolve this discrepancy, we consider a flux tube near the base of the convection zone in a solar-type star rotating eight times faster than the Sun, considering field intensification by weak-tube explosions. For the intensification to continue into to the buoyancy-dominated regime, the upper convection zone must have a significantly steeper temperature gradient than in the Sun, by a factor that is comparable with that found in 3D simulations of rotating convection. Within the hypothesis that stellar active regions stem from the base of the convection zone, flux emergence between 1-20 degree latitudes requires highly supercritical field strengths of up to 500 kG in rapidly rotating stars. These field strengths require explosions of 100-kG tubes within the convection zone, compatible with reasonable values of the superadiabatic temperature gradient associated with the more rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity IX: Empirical constraints on mass-loss rates and clumping parameters for OB supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Current implementations of mass loss for hot, massive stars in stellar evolution models include a sharp increase in mass loss when blue supergiants become cooler than Teff 20-22kK. This drastic mass-loss jump has been motivated by the potential presence of a so-called bistability ionisation effect, which may occur for line-driven winds in this temperature region due to recombination of important line-driving ions. Aims. We perform quantitative spectroscopy using UV (ULLYSES program) and optical (XShootU collaboration) data for 17 OB-supergiant stars in the LMC (covering the range Teff 14-32kK), deriving absolute constraints on global stellar, wind, and clumping parameters. We examine whether there are any empirical signs of a mass-loss jump in the investigated region, and we study the clumped nature of the wind. Methods. We use a combination of the model atmosphere code fastwind and the genetic algorithm code Kiwi-GA to fit synthetic spectra of a multitude of diagnostic spectral lines in the optical and UV. Results. We find no signs of any upward mass loss jump anywhere in the examined region. Standard theoretical comparison models, which include a strong bistability jump thus severely over predict the empirical mass-loss rates on the cool side of the predicted jump. Additionally, we find that on average about 40% of the total wind mass seems to reside in the diluted medium in between dense clumps. Conclusions. Our derived mass-loss rates suggest that for applications like stellar evolution one should not include a drastic bistability jump in mass loss for stars in the temperature and luminosity region investigated here. The derived high values of interclump density further suggest that the common assumption of an effectively void interclump medium (applied in the vast majority of spectroscopic studies of hot star winds) is not generally valid in this parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Double-edged sword: the influence of tidal interaction on stellar activity in binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra, we carried out a systematic study of stellar chromospheric activity in both single and binary stars. We constructed a binary sample and a single-star sample, mainly using the binary belt and the main sequence in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, respectively. By comparing the $S$ indices between single and binary stars within each color bin, we found for K type stars, binaries exhibit enhanced activity compared to single stars, which could be attributed to the increase in spin rate caused by tidal synchronization or to the interactions of magnetic fields. Both single stars and binaries fall on a common sequence in the activity-period relation, indicating that chromospheric activities of binaries are dominated by the more active components. More intriguingly, in some color ranges, a slight decline of the $S$ index for smaller orbital period was observed for binary stars. Although the possibility of sample selection effects cannot be excluded, this may mark the first example of super-saturation (i.e., caused by reduced active regions) being detected in chromospheric activity, or provide evidence of the suppressing effect on the magnetic dynamo and stellar activities by strong tidal interaction in very close binaries. Our study suggests that tidal interaction acts as a double-edged sword in relation to stellar activities.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT observations of Procyon at 815.5 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have conducted observations of the nearby (11.46 ly) star system Procyon, using MeerKAT's UHF (544-1087 MHz) receivers. We produce full-Stokes time and frequency integrated continuum images, as well as total intensity time series imaging at 8 s cadence, and full-Stokes vector-averaged dynamic spectra from the visibilities in order to search for transient activity such as flaring events. We detect no significant radio emission from the system, and estimate an upper limit on the circular polarisation fraction of 65 per cent (3$\sigma$ confidence level). A comparison with previous VLA observations places a 3$\sigma$ lower limit on the spectral index between 815.5 and 8400 MHz of 0.26, however long-term significant variability over the last 33 years cannot be ruled out without further, regular radio monitoring of the system.</description>

      <title>Transition Region Brightenings in a Moss Region and their Relation with Lower Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale Brightenings (SBs) are commonly observed in the transition region that separates the solar chromosphere from the corona. These brightenings, omnipresent in active region patches known as "moss" regions, could potentially contribute to the heating of active region plasma. In this study, we investigate the properties of SB events in a moss region and their associated chromospheric dynamics, which could provide insights into the underlying generation mechanisms of the SBs. We analyzed the data sets obtained by coordinated observations using the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Goode Solar Telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory. We studied 131 SB events in our region of interest and found that 100 showed spatial and temporal matches with the dynamics observed in the chromospheric H$\alpha$ images. Among these SBs, 98 of them were associated with spicules that are observed in H$\alpha$ images. Furthermore, detailed analysis revealed that one intense SB event corresponded to an Ellerman Bomb (EB), while another SB event consisted of several recurring brightenings caused by a stream of falling plasma. We observed that H$\alpha$ far wings often showed flashes of strong brightening caused by the falling plasma, creating an H$\alpha$ spectral profile similar to an EB. However, 31 of the 131 investigated SB events showed no noticeable spatial and temporal matches with any apparent features in H$\alpha$ images. Our analysis indicated that the predominant TR SB events in moss regions are associated with chromospheric phenomena primarily caused by spicules. Most of these spicules display properties akin to dynamic fibrils.</description>

      <title>The Value-added Catalog of OB Stars in LAMOST DR7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we update the catalog of OB stars based on the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) data release 7 and modified the OB stars selection criterion the spectral line indices space. The new catalog includes 37,778 spectra of 27,643 OB stars, of which 3827 OB stars are newly identified. The spectral subclasses of 27,643 OB stars are obtained using the automatic classification code MKCLASS. We find that the modified OB star selection criteria can better improve the completeness of late B-type stars by analyzing their spectral classification results given by MKCLASS. We also identify 3006 Be-type stars or candidates by examining the Balmer lines in their spectra and find that the frequency of our Be-type stars (10.9\%) is consistent with previous results. The spatial distribution of OB stars indicates that they are mainly located in the Galactic disk. This new catalog of OB stars will provide valuable data for studying the structure and evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>HCN and HNC in the Disk of an Outbursting Young Star, V883 Ori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) are isomers with similar chemical properties. However, HNC can be converted into other molecules by reactions with atomic hydrogen (H) and atomic oxygen (O), resulting in a variation of the HCN/HNC abundance ratio. These reaction rates are sensitive to gas temperature, resulting in different abundance ratios in different temperature environments. The emission of HCN and HNC was found to distribute along ring structures in the protoplanetary disk of V883 Ori. HCN exhibits a multi-ring structure consisting of inner and outer rings. The outer ring represents a genuine chemical structure, whereas the inner ring appears to display such characteristics due to the high dust continuum optical depth at the center. However, HNC is entirely depleted in the warmer inner ring, while its line intensity is similar to that of HCN in the colder outer ring. In this study, we present a chemical calculation that reproduces the observed HCN/HNC abundance ratio in the inner and outer rings. This calculation suggests that the distinct emission distribution between HCN and HNC results from a currently ongoing outburst in V883 Ori. The sublimation of HCN and HNC from grain surfaces and the conversion of HNC to HCN determine their chemical distribution in the heated, warm inner disk.</description>

      <title>Origin of 3He abundance enhancements in gradual solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the origin of 3He abundance enhancement in 23 high-energy (25-50 MeV) solar proton events that coincide with 3He-rich periods detected by ACE ULEIS in 1997-2021. In seven events, 3He enhancement was due to 3He leftover from preceding events or independent 3He events occurring during proton events. One event is the most likely impulsive (3He-rich), and another is unclear. Reaccelerated remnant flare material was the most probable cause of 3He enhancements in the remaining 14 proton events. Imaging observations showed coronal jets in the parent active regions in six of these 14 events. Remarkably, the highest 3He/4He occurred in events with jets, implying their contribution to 3He enhancement.</description>

      <title>An elemental abundance diagnostic for coordinated Solar Orbiter/SPICE and Hinode/EIS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma composition measurements are a vital tool for the success of current and future solar missions, but density and temperature insensitive spectroscopic diagnostic ratios are sparse, and their underlying accuracy in determining the magnitude of the First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect in the solar atmosphere remains an open question. Here we assess the Fe VIII 185.213A/Ne VIII 770.428A intensity ratio that can be observed as a multi-spacecraft combination between Solar Orbiter/SPICE and Hinode/EIS. We find that it is fairly insensitive to temperature and density in the range of log (T/K) = 5.65-6.05 and is therefore useful, in principle, for analyzing on-orbit EUV spectra. We also perform an empirical experiment, using Hinode/EIS measurements of coronal fan loop temperature distributions weighted by randomnly generated FIP bias values, to show that our diagnostic method can provide accurate results as it recovers the input FIP bias to within 10--14%. This is encouraging since it is smaller than the magnitude of variations seen throughout the solar corona. We apply the diagnostic to coordinated observations from 2023 March, and show that the combination of SPICE and EIS allows measurements of the Fe/Ne FIP bias in the regions where the footpoints of the magnetic field connected to Solar Orbiter are predicted to be located. The results show an increase in FIP bias between the main leading polarity and the trailing decayed polarity that broadly agrees with Fe/O in-situ measurements from Solar Orbiter/SWA. Multi-spacecraft coordinated observations are complex, but this diagnostic also falls within the planned wavebands for Solar-C/EUVST.</description>

      <title>High-resolution Observations of Clustered Dynamic Extreme-Ultraviolet Bright Tadpoles near the Footpoints of Corona Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extreme ultraviolet (EUV) close-up view of the Sun offers unprecedented detail of heating events in the solar corona. Enhanced temporal and spatial images obtained by the Solar Orbiter during its first science perihelion enabled us to identify clustered EUV bright tadpoles (CEBTs) occurring near the footpoints of coronal loops. Combining SDO/AIA observations, we determine the altitudes of six distinct CEBTs by stereoscopy, ranging from $\sim$1300 to 3300 km. We then notice a substantial presence of dark, cooler filamentary structures seemingly beneath the CEBTs, displaying periodic up-and-down motions lasting 3 to 5 minutes. This periodic behavior suggests an association of the majority of CEBTs with Type I spicules. Out of the ten selected CEBTs with fast downward velocity, six exhibit corrected velocities close to or exceeding 50 km $s^{-1}$. These velocities notably surpass the typical speeds of Type I spicules. We explore the generation of such velocities. It indicates that due to the previous limited observations of spicules in the EUV wavelengths, they may reveal novel observational features beyond our current understanding. Gaining insights into these features contributes to a better comprehension of small-scale coronal heating dynamics.</description>

      <title>The magnetic topology of AR13664 leading to its first halo CME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first half of May 2024, the solar active region (AR)13664 was responsible for generating the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years, through an enhanced production of X-class flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). A key factor in this production was the complex magnetic topology of AR13664. In this work, we investigate the region's magnetic topology related to the production of its first halo CME on May 8th. This is achieved by combining different observations of magnetic topology based on photospheric magnetic winding signatures and nonlinear force-free extrapolations, together with Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) observations at different wavelengths. We present evidence that the first halo CME, and its associated X1 flare, was created by an emerging bipole of twisted magnetic field, following the general picture of the standard flare model. The coincidence of the first large magnetic winding signature with the start time of the X1 flare, provides the onset time for the CME as well as the period of enhanced eruptive activity of the region - 04:36UT on May 8th. Finally, our topological analysis identifies the key topological sub-regions of AR13664 that can lead to subsequent eruptions, which will be useful for further studies of this region.</description>

      <title>Identifying new high-confidence polluted white dwarf candidates using Gaia XP spectra and Self-Organizing Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of new white dwarfs (WDs) polluted with heavy elements is important since they provide a valuable tool for inferring chemical properties of putative planetary systems accreting material on their surfaces. The Gaia space mission has provided us with an unprecedented amount of astrometric, photometric, and low resolution (XP) spectroscopic data for millions of newly discovered stellar sources, among them thousands of WDs. In order to find WDs among this data and to identify which ones have metals in their atmospheres, we propose a methodology based on an unsupervised artificial intelligence technique called Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). In our approach a nonlinear high-dimensional dataset is projected on a 2D grid map where similar elements fall into the same neuron.
  By applying this method, we obtained a clean sample of 66,337 WDs. We performed an automatic spectral classification analysis to them, obtaining 143 bona fide polluted WD candidates not previously classified in the literature. The majority of them are cool WDs and we identify in their XP spectra several metallic lines such as Ca, Mg, Na, Li, and K. The fact that we obtain similar precision metrics than those achieved with recent supervised techniques highlights the power of our unsupervised approach to mine the Gaia archives for hidden treasures to follow-up spectroscopically with higher resolution.</description>

      <title>Deep Multimodal Representation Learning for Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus, the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits explicit physical meaning. Evaluating Using this representation space to perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate and precise label predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary interactions are commonplace among massive stars, giving rise observed phenomena such as X-ray binaries, stripped stars &amp; supernovae, and gravitational-wave sources. The multiplicity properties of massive stars thus represent a fundamental observable to calibrate, test, and benchmark models of single-star and binary evolution. In these proceedings, I provide a modern summary of the observed properties of massive binaries across various metallicities, and discuss open problems in the field.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Flare Forecasting with Deep Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flare forecasting mainly relies on photospheric magnetograms and associated physical features to predict forthcoming flares. However, it is believed that flare initiation mechanisms often originate in the chromosphere and the lower corona. In this study, we employ deep learning as a purely data-driven approach to compare the predictive capabilities of chromospheric and coronal UV and EUV emissions across different wavelengths with those of photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Our findings indicate that individual EUV wavelengths can provide discriminatory power comparable or better to that of line-of-sight magnetograms. Moreover, we identify simple multimodal neural network architectures that consistently outperform single-input models, showing complementarity between the flare precursors that can be extracted from the distinct layers of the solar atmosphere. To mitigate potential biases from known misattributions in Active Region flare catalogs, our models are trained and evaluated using full-disk images and a comprehensive flare event catalog at the full-disk level. We introduce a deep-learning architecture suited for extracting temporal features from full-disk videos.</description>

      <title>Cthulhu: An Open Source Molecular and Atomic Cross Section Computation Code for Substellar Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric studies of exoplanets and brown dwarfs are a cutting-edge and rapidly evolving area of astrophysics research. Calculating models of exoplanet or brown dwarf spectra requires knowledge of the wavelength-dependent absorption of light (cross sections) by the molecules and atoms in the atmosphere. Here we introduce Cthulhu, a pure Python package that rapidly calculates cross sections from atomic and molecular line lists. Cthulhu includes modules to automatically download molecular line lists from online databases (e.g. ExoMol and HITRAN) and compute cross sections on a user-specified temperature, pressure, and wavenumber grid. Cthulhu requires only CPUs and can run on a user's laptop (for smaller line lists with &lt; 100 million lines) or on a large cluster in parallel (for many billion lines). Cthulhu includes in-depth Jupyter tutorials in the online documentation. Finally, Cthulhu can be used as an educational tool to demystify the process of making cross sections for atmospheric models.</description>

      <title>The disappearance of a massive star marking the birth of a black hole in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar mass black holes are formed from the terminal collapse of massive stars if the ensuing neutrino shock is unable to eject the stellar envelope. Direct observations of black hole formation remain inconclusive. We report observations of M31-2014-DS1, a massive, hydrogen-depleted supergiant in the Andromeda galaxy identified via a mid-infrared brightening in 2014. Its total luminosity remained nearly constant for the subsequent thousand days, before fading dramatically over the next thousand days by $\gtrsim 10\times$ and $\gtrsim 10^4\times$ in total and visible light, respectively. Together with the lack of a detected optical outburst, the observations are explained by the fallback of the stellar envelope into a newly formed black hole, moderated by the injection of a $\sim 10^{48}$ erg shock. Unifying these observations with a candidate in NGC 6946, we present a concordant picture for the birth of stellar mass black holes from stripped massive stars.</description>

      <title>Circumplanetary Disks are Rare around Planets at Large Orbital Radii: A Parameter Survey of Flow Morphology around Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks (CPDs) varies with planet mass and protoplanetary disk aspect ratio. Using static mesh refinement and a near-isothermal equation of state, we perform a small parameter survey of hydrodynamic simulations with parameters appropriate for disk-embedded protoplanets at moderate to large orbital radii. We find that CPD formation occurs along a continuum, with ``diskiness'' increasing smoothly with planetary mass and decreasing disk aspect ratio. As expected from disk hydrostatic equilibrium arguments, the transition from envelope-dominated to disk-dominated structures is determined to first order by the ratio of the planetary Hill sphere radius to the disk scale height, but planets need to be significantly super-thermal to host classical rotationally supported CPDs. The circularization radius of inflowing gas (as a fraction of the Hill sphere radius) shows an approximately quadratic power-law scaling with the ratio of planetary mass to the thermal mass. Compared to more physically complete radiation hydrodynamic simulations, our runs almost maximize the possibility for classical CPD formation, and hence define a plausible necessary condition for CPDs. The low abundance of detected CPDs in disks where planetary companions are inferred from substructure data may be due to a combination of the large scale height of the protoplanetary disk, and a low frequency of sufficiently massive protoplanets. Unless their CPDs cool below the local protoplanetary disk temperature, most of the wide-orbit giant planet population will be embedded in quasi-spherical envelopes that are hard to detect. Disks, and satellite systems, are more likely to form around smaller orbital separation planets.</description>

      <title>Origin of Ca II emission around polluted white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dozens of white dwarfs with anomalous metal polluted atmospheres (DZ WDs) are known to host dust and gas discs. The line profiles of the Ca II triplet emitted by the gas discs show significant asymmetry. Several minor planets have been discovered orbiting such WDs. The most challenging burden of modelling gas discs around DZ WDs is to simultaneously explain the asymmetry and metal pollution of the WD's atmosphere, while staying consistent with other aspects of the observations, like the morphology of the Ca II lines. This paper aims to construct a self-consistent model to explain the simultaneous WD pollution and Ca II line asymmetry over at least three years. In our model an asteroid disintegrates in an eccentric orbit, periodically entering below the WD's Roche limit. The resulting debris sublimates at a temperature of 1500 K, producing gas that viscously spreads to form a disc. The evolution of the discs is studied over a period of 1.2 years using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Synthetic Ca II line profiles are calculated using the surface mass density and velocity distributions provided by the simulations, for the first time taking into account the asymmetric velocity distribution in the discs. An asteroid disintegrating in an eccentric orbit gives rise to the formation of an asymmetric disc and asymmetric Ca II triplet emission. Our model can explain the periodic reversal of the red- and blueshifted peak of the Ca II lines caused by the precession of the disc on timescales of 10.6 to 177.4 days. Our work suggests that the persistence of Ca II asymmetry over decades and its periodic change in the peaks can be explained in two scenarios: a) the asteroid disrupts on a short timescale (couple of orbits), and the gas has a low viscosity range (0.001&lt;alpha&lt;0.05), b) the asteroid disrupts on a timescale of a year, and the viscosity of the gas is required to be high, alpha=0.1.</description>

      <title>Probing Na in giant exoplanets with ESPRESSO and 3D NLTE stellar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral sodium was the first atom detected in an exoplanetary atmosphere via transmission spectroscopy and remains the most frequently detected species due to its strong doublet in the optical. However, the center-to-limb variation (CLV) of these lines in the host star can bias the Na detection.When combined with the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, the CLV can mimic or obscure planetary absorption features. This work investigates the impact of 3D radiation hydrodynamic stellar atmospheres and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer on the modeling of the CLV+RM effect in single-line transmission spectroscopy, to improve the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We produced a grid of 3D NLTE synthetic spectra for Na I for FGK stars within the following parameter space: Teff=4500-6500 K, log g=4.0-5.0 and [Fe/H]=-0.5, 0, 0.5.This grid was then interpolated to match the stellar parameters of four stars hosting giant exoplanets, to correct for the CLV+RM effect in their transmission spectra. We used ESPRESSO archival observations. Our work confirms the Na detections in three systems, namely WASP-52b, WASP-76b, and WASP-127b, improving the accuracy of the measured absorption depth. Furthermore, we find that 3D NLTE stellar models can explain the spectral features in HD 209458b without the need for any planetary absorption. In the grid of synthetic spectra, we observe that the CLV effect is stronger for stars with low Teff and high log g. However, the combined effect of CLV and RM is highly dependent on the orbital geometry of the planet-star system. With the continuous improvement of instrumentation, it is crucial to use the most accurate stellar models to correct for the CLV+RM effect in high-resolution transmission spectra, to achieve the best possible characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. We make our grid of 3D NLTE spectra for Na publicly available.</description>

Abstract: We present 850 {\mu}m thermal dust polarization observations with a resolution of 14.4"(~ 0.13 pc) towards an infrared dark cloud G16.96+0.27 using JCMT/POL-2. The average magnetic field orientation, which roughly agrees with the larger-scale magnetic field orientation traced by the Planck 353 GHz data, is approximately perpendicular to the filament structure. The estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strength is ~ 96 {\mu}G and ~ 60 {\mu}G using two variants of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi methods. We calculate the virial and magnetic critical parameters to evaluate the relative importance of gravity, the magnetic field, and turbulence. The magnetic field and turbulence are both weaker than gravity, but magnetic fields and turbulence together are equal to gravity, suggesting that G16.96+0.27 is in a quasi-equilibrium state. The cloud-magnetic-field alignment is found to have a trend moving away from perpendicularity in the dense regions, which may serve as a tracer of potential fragmentation in such quiescent filaments.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurements of Synchrotron-Emitting Electrons at Near-Sun Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present the first-ever direct measurements of synchrotron-emitting heliospheric traveling shocks, intercepted by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) during its close encounters. Given that much of our understanding of powerful astrophysical shocks is derived from synchrotron radiation, these observations by PSP provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore how shocks accelerate relativistic electrons and the conditions under which they emit radiation. The probe's unparalleled capabilities to measure both electromagnetic fields and energetic particles with high precision in the near-Sun environment has allowed us to directly correlate the distribution of relativistic electrons with the resulting photon emissions. Our findings reveal that strong quasi-parallel shocks emit radiation at significantly higher intensities than quasi-perpendicular shocks due to the efficient acceleration of ultra-relativistic electrons. These experimental results are consistent with theory and recent observations of supernova remnant shocks and advance our understanding of shock physics across diverse space environments.</description>

      <title>Some generalizations of the convective model of jet generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For analytical description of the initial stage of jet generation in nonequilibrium inhomogeneous plasma in the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, possible generalizations of solutions of the nonlinear equation for the stream function are analyzed. The jet generation model is based on the mechanism of convective instability and the frozen-in condition of magnetic field lines and is characterized by a number of free parameters. The equation for the radial part of the stream function is satisfied by first-order Bessel functions. To satisfy all the conditions near the jet axis and on its periphery, the found solutions are smoothly joined at the boundary. The final analytical solution for the velocity field is applicable to arbitrary values of dimensionless coordinates. The poloidal velocity increases approximately exponentially, and the azimuthal velocity - according to a superexponential law. In this paper, the velocity field of the jet, which consists of seven sections, is calculated. The rotation of the jet turns out to be differential, and to obtain a solution in quadratures for the azimuthal velocity, one can use not only linear but also power dependences on the altitude. For the exponent n &lt; 1, a noticeable increase in the azimuthal velocity with radius is observed immediately from the jet axis, and for n &gt; 1, a region of relative calm is observed near the axis. The jet model is generalized to the case of an arbitrary dependence of the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency on the altitude. The corresponding solutions are found for the radial and vertical velocity components. For the initial stage of development, the vertical and azimuthal components of the generated magnetic field of the jet were also found in the work.</description>

Recent measurements of carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) neutrinos by the Borexino experiment show a $\sim2\sigma$ tension with the "low-metallicity" determinations. $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O, the slowest reaction in the CNO cycle, plays a crucial role in the standard solar model (SSM) calculations of CNO neutrino fluxes. Here we report a direct measurement of the $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction, in which $S$-factors for all transitions were simultaneously determined in the energy range of $E_p=110-260$ keV for the first time. Our results resolve previous discrepancies in the ground-state transition, yielding a zero-energy $S$-factor $S_{114}(0) = 1.92\pm0.08$ keV b which is 14% higher than the $1.68\pm0.14$ keV b recommended in Solar Fusion III (SF-III). With our $S_{114}$ values, the SSM B23-GS98, and the latest global analysis of solar neutrino measurements, the C and N photospheric abundance determined by the Borexino experiment is updated to $N_{\mathrm{CN}}=({4.45}^{+0.69}_{-0.61})\times10^{-4}$. This new $N_{\mathrm{CN}}$ value agrees well with latest "high-metallicity" composition, however, is also consistent with the "low-metallicity" determination within $\sim 1\sigma$ C.L., indicating that the solar metallicity problem remains an open question. In addition, the significant reduction in the uncertainty of $S_{114}$ paves the way for the precise determination of the CN abundance in future large-volume solar neutrino measurements.</description>

      <title>The period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud observed with ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Period-luminosity relations of long period variables (LPVs) are a powerful tool to map the distances of stars in our galaxy, and are typically calibrated using stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Recent results demonstrated that these relations show a strong dependence on the amplitude of the variability, which can be used to greatly improve distance estimates. However, one of the only highly sampled catalogs of such variables in the LMC is based on OGLE photometry, which does not provide all-sky coverage. Here, we provide the first measurement of the period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the LMC using photometry from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We derive conversions between ugriz, Gaia, and ATLAS c and o passbands with a precision of approximately 0.02 mag, which enable the measurement of reliable amplitudes with ATLAS for crowded fields. We successfully reproduce the known PL sequences A through E, and show evidence for sequence F using the ratios of amplitudes observed in both ATLAS pass-bands. Our work demonstrates that the ATLAS survey can recover variability in evolved red giants and lays the foundation for an all-sky distance map of the Milky Way using long-period variables.</description>

      <title>Calibrating and standardizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch in the Small Magellanic Cloud using small-amplitude red giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the absolute calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) classified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We show that all stars near the SMC's TRGB are SARGs. Distinguishing older and younger RGs near the Tip according to two period-luminosity sequences labeled A and B, we show many similarities among SARG populations of the LMC and the SMC, along with notable differences. Specifically, SMC SARGs have shorter periods due to lower metallicity and smaller amplitudes due to younger ages than LMC SARGs. We discover two period-color relations near the TRGB that span all A- and B-sequence stars in the OGLE-III footprints of the SMC and LMC, and we investigate using periods instead of color for TRGB standardization. Using variability derived information only, we trace the SMC's age and metallicity gradients and show the core to be populated by younger, more metal rich RGs. The B-sequence yields the brightest and most accurate calibration ($M_{\mathrm{F814W,syn}} = -4.057 \pm 0.019 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.029 (\mathrm{syst.})$ mag), which we use to measure the distance modulus difference between the Clouds and investigate metallicity effects. Distance measurements not informed by variability should employ the SARGs-based calibration based on all stars near the tip ($M_{\mathrm{F814W,syn}} = -4.024 \pm 0.041 (\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.029 (\mathrm{syst.})$ mag). Our work highlights the impact of RG population diversity on TRGB distance measurements. Further study is needed unravel these effects and improve TRGB standardization.</description>

      <title>A Buddy for Betelgeuse: Binarity as the Origin of the Long Secondary Period in $\alpha$ Orionis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the existence of $\alpha$ Ori B, a low-mass companion orbiting Betelgeuse. This is motivated by the presence of a 2170-day Long Secondary Period (LSP) in Betelgeuse's lightcurve, a periodicity $\approx5$ times longer than the star's 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is currently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial velocity variation observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a revision of the prevailing physical picture. The lightcurve-RV phase difference requires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, 180 degrees out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation. We demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational constraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within this framework, we calculate a mass for $\alpha$ Ori B of $M\sin i =1.17\pm0.7\,M_\odot$ and an orbital separation of $1850\pm70\,R_\odot$, or $2.43^{+0.21}_{-0.32}$ times the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion as constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital system, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion's existence observationally.</description>

      <title>She's Got Her Mother's Hair: Unveiling the Origin of Black Hole Magnetic Fields through Stellar to Collapsar Simulations</title>

Abstract: Relativistic jets from a Kerr black hole (BH) following the core collapse of a massive star ("collapsar") is a leading model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, the two key ingredients for a Blandford-Znajek powered jet $-$ rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field $-$ seem mutually exclusive. Strong fields in the progenitor star's core transport angular momentum outwards more quickly, slowing down the core before collapse. Through innovative multidisciplinary modeling, we first use MESA stellar evolution models followed to core collapse, to explicitly show that the small length-scale of the instabilities $-$ likely responsible for angular momentum transport in the core (e.g., Tayler-Spruit) $ - $ results in a low net magnetic flux fed to the BH horizon, far too small to power GRB jets. Instead, we propose a novel scenario in which collapsar BHs acquire their magnetic "hair" from their progenitor proto-neutron star (PNS), which is likely highly magnetized from an internal dynamo. We evaluate the conditions for the BH accretion disk to pin the PNS magnetosphere to its horizon immediately after the collapse. Our results show that the PNS spin-down energy released before collapse matches the kinetic energy of Type Ic-BL supernovae, while the nascent BH's spin and magnetic flux produce jets consistent with observed GRB characteristics. We map our MESA models to 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations and confirm that accretion disks confine the strong magnetic flux initiated near a rotating BH, enabling the launch of successful GRB jets, whereas a slower-spinning BH or one without a disk fails to do so.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. I. Low Stellar Obliquity in the Transiting Brown Dwarf System GPX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the OATMEAL survey, an effort to measure the obliquities of stars with transiting brown dwarf companions. We observed a transit of the close-in ($P_{\rm orb} = 1.74 \,$ days) brown dwarf GPX-1 b using the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph to measure the sky-projected angle between its orbital axis and the spin axis of its early F-type host star ($\lambda$). We measured $\lambda = 6.88 \pm 1.72 ^\circ$ (with additional unquantified systematic uncertainty), suggesting an orbit that is prograde and well aligned with the stellar equator. Hot Jupiters around early F stars are frequently found to have highly misaligned orbits, with polar and retrograde orbits being commonplace. It has been theorized that these misalignments stem from dynamical interactions, such as von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov cycles, and are retained over long timescales due to weak tidal dissipation in stars with radiative envelopes. By comparing GPX-1 to similar systems under the frameworks of different tidal evolution theories, we argued that the rate of tidal dissipation is too slow to have re-aligned the system. This suggests that GPX-1 may have arrived at its close-in orbit via coplanar high-eccentricity migration or migration through an aligned protoplanetary disk. Our result for GPX-1 is one of few measurements of the obliquity of a star with a transiting brown dwarf. By enlarging the number of such measurements and comparing them with hot Jupiter systems, we will more clearly discern the differences between the mechanisms that dictate the formation and evolution of both classes of objects.</description>
