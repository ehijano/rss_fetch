      <title>Numerical evolution of the resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic equations: a minimally implicit Runge-Kutta scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Minimally-Implicit Runge-Kutta (MIRK) methods for the numerical evolution of the resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, following the approach proposed by Komissarov (2007) of an augmented system of evolution equations to numerically deal with constraints. Previous approaches rely on Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta schemes; in general, compared to explicit schemes, IMEX methods need to apply the recovery (which can be very expensive computationally) of the primitive variables from the conserved ones in numerous additional times. Moreover, the use of an iterative process for the recovery could have potential convergence problems, increased by the additional number of required loops. In addition, the computational cost of the previous IMEX approach in comparison with the standard explicit methods is much higher. The MIRK methods are able to deal with stiff terms producing stable numerical evolutions, minimize the number of recoveries needed in comparison with IMEX methods, their computational cost is similar to the standard explicit methods and can actually be easily implemented in numerical codes which previously used explicit schemes. Two standard numerical tests are shown in the manuscript.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the clock, stochastic cutoff, and Tomita Monte Carlo methods in simulating the dipolar triangular lattice at criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic nanostructures find application in diverse technological domains and their behavior is significantly influenced by long-range dipolar interactions. However, simulating these systems using the traditional Metropolis Monte Carlo method poses high computational demand. Several methods, including the clock, stochastic cutoff, and Tomita approaches, can reduce the computational burden of simulating 2D systems with dipolar interactions. Although these three methods rely on distinct theoretical concepts, they all achieve complexity reduction by a common strategy. Instead of calculating the energy difference between a spin and all its neighbors, they evaluate the energy difference with only a limited number of randomly chosen neighbors. This is achieved through methods like the dynamic thinning and Fukui-Todo techniques. In this article, we compared the performance of the clock, SCO, Tomita, and Metropolis methods near the critical point of the dipolar triangular lattice to identify the most suitable algorithm for this type of simulation. Our findings show that while these methods are less suitable for simulating this system in their untuned implementation, incorporating the boxing nearby neighbors method and overrelaxation moves makes them significantly more efficient and better suited than the Metropolis method with overrelaxation.</description>

      <title>Improving HISQ propagator solves using deflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typically, the conjugate gradient (CG) algorithm employs mixed precision and even-odd preconditioning to compute propagators for highly improved staggered quarks (HISQ). This approach suffers from critical slowing down as the light quark mass is decreased to its physical value. Multigrid is one alternative to combat critical slowing down; however, it involves setup costs that are not always easy to amortize. We consider deflation, which can also remove critical slowing down, but incurs its own setup cost to compute eigenvectors. Results using the MILC and QUDA software libraries to generate eigenvectors and to perform deflated solves on lattices up to $144^3 \times 288$ (with lattice spacing 0.04 fm) and with a range of quark masses from the physical strange down to the physical light quark values will be presented. We compare with CG and comment on deflation versus multigrid.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network based Damage Identification for Truss Railroad Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Railroad bridges are a crucial component of the U.S. freight rail system, which moves over 40 percent of the nation's freight and plays a critical role in the economy. However, aging bridge infrastructure and increasing train traffic pose significant safety hazards and risk service disruptions. The U.S. rail network includes over 100,000 railroad bridges, averaging one every 1.4 miles of track, with steel bridges comprising over 50% of the network's total bridge length. Early identification and assessment of damage in these bridges remain challenging tasks. This study proposes a physics-informed neural network (PINN) based approach for damage identification in steel truss railroad bridges. The proposed approach employs an unsupervised learning approach, eliminating the need for large datasets typically required by supervised methods. The approach utilizes train wheel load data and bridge response during train crossing events as inputs for damage identification. The PINN model explicitly incorporates the governing differential equations of the linear time-varying (LTV) bridge-train system. Herein, this model employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) based architecture incorporating a custom Runge-Kutta (RK) integrator cell, designed for gradient-based learning. The proposed approach updates the bridge finite element model while also quantifying damage severity and localizing the affected structural members. A case study on the Calumet Bridge in Chicago, Illinois, with simulated damage scenarios, is used to demonstrate the model's effectiveness in identifying damage while maintaining low false-positive rates. Furthermore, the damage identification pipeline is designed to seamlessly integrate prior knowledge from inspections and drone surveys, also enabling context-aware updating and assessment of bridge's condition.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GPT-2 level text and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lie Symmetries in Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural operators (PINOs) have emerged as powerful tools for learning solution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs). Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating Lie point symmetry information can significantly enhance the training efficiency of PINOs, primarily through techniques like data, architecture, and loss augmentation. In this work, we focus on the latter, highlighting that point symmetries oftentimes result in no training signal, limiting their effectiveness in many problems. To address this, we propose a novel loss augmentation strategy that leverages evolutionary representatives of point symmetries, a specific class of generalized symmetries of the underlying PDE. These generalized symmetries provide a richer set of generators compared to standard symmetries, leading to a more informative training signal. We demonstrate that leveraging evolutionary representatives enhances the performance of neural operators, resulting in improved data efficiency and accuracy during training.</description>

      <title>Star-shaped nanostructure-based multifunctional chiral metasurface for near-infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we reported, for the first time, a chiral metasurface with multifunctional capabilities tailored for the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range, garnering tremendous interest in applications such as optical communication and chiral sensing. The structure comprised star and bar-shaped silver antennas immersed in SiO2. In computational simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method, the proposed architecture yielded a maximum circular dichroism of 0.7 at 971.5 nm wavelength and a maximum asymmetric transmission under linearly polarized excitation of 0.92 at 1020 nm wavelength. Moreover, this multifunctional structure manifested near-perfect cross-polarization conversions for both linear and circular polarizations, as well as linear to circular and elliptical polarization conversion effects at different bands within the NIR spectral region. The enhanced light-matter interaction of the proposed structure was utilized to detect and differentiate two enantiomers of 1,2-propanediol, yielding excellent chirality sensing capability. As a multifunctional compact chiral platform, the proposed structure is expected to find direct applications in integrated and miniaturized multi-channel optical communication platforms, materials and biomolecules sensing in attomolar concentrations, and the pharmaceutical industry.</description>

      <title>MetaOpenFOAM 2.0: Large Language Model Driven Chain of Thought for Automating CFD Simulation and Post-Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used in aerospace, energy, and biology to model fluid flow, heat transfer, and chemical reactions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed various domains, their application in CFD remains limited, particularly for complex tasks like post-processing. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaOpenFOAM 2.0, which leverages Chain of Thought (COT) decomposition and iterative verification to enhance accessibility for non-expert users through natural language inputs. Tested on a new benchmark covering simulation (fluid flow, heat transfer, combustion) and post-processing (extraction, visualization), MetaOpenFOAM 2.0 achieved an Executability score of 6.3/7 and a pass rate of 86.9%, significantly outperforming MetaOpenFOAM 1.0 (2.1/7, 0%). Additionally, it proved cost-efficient, averaging $0.15 per case. An ablation study confirmed that COT-driven decomposition and iterative refinement substantially improved task performance. Furthermore, scaling laws showed that increasing COT steps enhanced accuracy while raising token usage, aligning with LLM post-training scaling trends. These results highlight the transformative potential of LLMs in automating CFD workflows for industrial and research applications.

      <title>Muti-Fidelity Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification with Laplace Neural Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laplace Neural Operators (LNOs) have recently emerged as a promising approach in scientific machine learning due to the ability to learn nonlinear maps between functional spaces. However, this framework often requires substantial amounts of high-fidelity (HF) training data, which is often prohibitively expensive to acquire. To address this, we propose multi-fidelity Laplace Neural Operators (MF-LNOs), which combine a low-fidelity (LF) base model with parallel linear/nonlinear HF correctors and dynamic inter-fidelity weighting. This allows us to exploit correlations between LF and HF datasets and achieve accurate inference of quantities of interest even with sparse HF data. We further incorporate a modified replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm, which enables a more effective posterior distribution estimation and uncertainty quantification in model predictions. Extensive validation across four canonical dynamical systems (the Lorenz system, Duffing oscillator, Burgers equation, and Brusselator reaction-diffusion system) demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. The results show significant improvements, with testing losses reduced by 40% to 80% compared to traditional approaches. This validates MF-LNO as a versatile tool for surrogate modeling in parametric PDEs, offering significant improvements in data efficiency and uncertainty-aware prediction.</description>

      <title>Gradient Alignment in Physics-informed Neural Networks: A Second-Order Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning through composite loss functions is fundamental to modern deep learning, yet optimizing competing objectives remains challenging. We present new theoretical and practical approaches for addressing directional conflicts between loss terms, demonstrating their effectiveness in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) where such conflicts are particularly challenging to resolve. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how these conflicts limit first-order methods and show that second-order optimization naturally resolves them through implicit gradient alignment. We prove that SOAP, a recently proposed quasi-Newton method, efficiently approximates the Hessian preconditioner, enabling breakthrough performance in PINNs: state-of-the-art results on 10 challenging PDE benchmarks, including the first successful application to turbulent flows with Reynolds numbers up to 10,000, with 2-10x accuracy improvements over existing methods. We also introduce a novel gradient alignment score that generalizes cosine similarity to multiple gradients, providing a practical tool for analyzing optimization dynamics. Our findings establish frameworks for understanding and resolving gradient conflicts, with broad implications for optimization beyond scientific computing.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Implementation of Edge-Based Discretization without Forming Dual Control Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper shows that lumped directed-area vectors at edges and dual control volumes required to implement the edge-based discretization can be computed without explicitly defining the dual control volume around each node for triangular and tetrahedral grids. It is a simpler implementation because there is no need to form a dual control volume by connecting edge-midpoints, face centroids, and element centroids, and also reduces the time for computing lumped directed-area vectors for a given grid, especially for tetrahedral grids. The speed-up achieved by the proposed algorithm may not be large enough to greatly impact the overall simulation time, but the proposed algorithm is expected to serve as a major stepping stone towards extending the edge-based discretization to four dimensions and beyond (e.g., space-time simulations). Efficient algorithms for computing lumped directed-area vectors and dual volumes without forming dual volumes are presented, and their implementations are described and compared with traditional algorithms in terms of complexity as well as actual computing time for a given grid.</description>

      <title>Superlubric Motion of Wave-like Domain Walls in Sliding Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding ferroelectrics constructed from stacked nonpolar monolayers enable out-of-plane polarization in two dimensions with exceptional properties, including ultrafast switching speeds and fatigue-free behavior. However, the widely accepted switching mechanism, which posits synchronized long-distance in-plane translation of entire atomic layers driven by an out-of-plane electric field, has shown inconsistencies with experimental observations. We demonstrate that this spinodal decomposition-like homogeneous switching process violates Neumann's principle and is unlikely to occur due to symmetry constraint. Instead, symmetry-breaking domain walls (DWs) and the tensorial nature of Born effective charges are critical for polarization reversal, underscoring the quantum nature of sliding ferroelectrics. Using the Bernal-stacked $h$-BN bilayer as a model system, we discover that the coherent propagation of wide, wave-like domain walls is the key mechanism for ferroelectric switching. This mechanism fundamentally differs from the layer-by-layer switching associated with narrow domain walls, which has been established for over sixty years in perovskite ferroelectrics. Moreover, these wave-like DWs exhibit superlubric dynamics, achieving ultrahigh velocities of approximately 4000 m/s at room temperature and displaying an anomalous cooling-promoted switching speed. The unexpected emergence of DW superlubricity in sliding ferroelectrics presents new avenues for enhancing key performance metrics and offers exciting opportunities for applications in cryogenic environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Scalable Density Functional Theory Hamiltonian Prediction through Adaptive Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian matrix prediction is pivotal in computational chemistry, serving as the foundation for determining a wide range of molecular properties. While SE(3) equivariant graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in this domain, their substantial computational cost-driven by high-order tensor product (TP) operations-restricts their scalability to large molecular systems with extensive basis sets. To address this challenge, we introduce SPHNet, an efficient and scalable equivariant network that incorporates adaptive sparsity into Hamiltonian prediction. SPHNet employs two innovative sparse gates to selectively constrain non-critical interaction combinations, significantly reducing tensor product computations while maintaining accuracy. To optimize the sparse representation, we develop a Three-phase Sparsity Scheduler, ensuring stable convergence and achieving high performance at sparsity rates of up to 70 percent. Extensive evaluations on QH9 and PubchemQH datasets demonstrate that SPHNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing up to a 7x speedup over existing models. Beyond Hamiltonian prediction, the proposed sparsification techniques also hold significant potential for improving the efficiency and scalability of other SE(3) equivariant networks, further broadening their applicability and impact.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This polarization arises from the momentum-dependent spin splitting, which is unique to altermagnets, and which induces a momentum-dependent optical intersite spin transfer effect. Furthermore, the ferrimagnetic polarization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. The excitation along the spin-polarized planes breaks the symmetry of the momentum-space magnetization distribution, leading to inequivalent spin-resolved charge transfer between sublattices across both momentum and real space. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferri-magnetic state.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of linear momentum in widely used hierarchical methods in gravitational gas dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper considers the implementation of the fast multipole method (FMM) in the PHANTOM code for the calculation of forces in a self-gravitating system. The gravitational interaction forces are divided into short-range and long-range interactions depending on the value of the tree opening parameter of the hierarchical kd-tree. It is demonstrated that Newton's third law holds for any pair of cells of the kd-tree engaged in mutual interaction. However, for the entire system a linear momentum is not conserved. As a result, there is an unphysical force that causes the center of mass to migrate. For example, for a pair of neutron stars, the displacement of the system's center of mass is found to be comparable to the radii of the objects at times of a few tens of Keplerian revolutions. This displacement cannot be reduced by increasing the number of particles for values of the tree opening parameter greater than 0.2. For smaller values, the time required for the calculation is significantly longer.</description>

      <title>Comparison of stochastic BGK and FP methods for the simulation of non-equilibrium multi-species molecular gas flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to limited possibilities of experimental investigations for non-equilibrium gas flows, numerical results are of highest interest. Although the well-established Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method achieves highly accurate solutions, the computational requirements increase excessively for lower Knudsen regimes. Computationally more efficient simulations can be achieved with stochastic continuum-based methods using either the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) or the Fokker-Planck (FP) approximations where, instead of particle collisions, particle relaxation processes are considered. This paper explains the implementation of different stochastic BGK and FP methods in the open-source particle code PICLas for multi-species molecular gas flows. For verification, the results of different test cases are compared.</description>

      <title>QuanEstimation.jl: An open-source Julia framework for quantum parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the main theoretical support of quantum metrology, quantum parameter estimation must follow the steps of quantum metrology towards the applied science and industry. Hence, optimal scheme design will soon be a crucial and core task for quantum parameter estimation. To efficiently accomplish this task, software packages aimed at computer-aided design are in high demand. In response to this need, we hereby introduce QuanEstimation.jl, an open-source Julia framework for scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation. It can be used either as an independent package or as the computational core of the recently developed hybrid-language (Python-Julia) package QuanEstimation [Phys. Rev. Res. 4, 043057 (2022)]. Utilizing this framework, the scheme evaluation and design in quantum parameter estimation can be readily performed, especially when quantum noises exist.</description>

      <title>VBIM-Net: Variational Born Iterative Network for Inverse Scattering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18731v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, studies have shown the potential of integrating field-type iterative methods with deep learning (DL) techniques in solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs). In this article, we propose a novel Variational Born Iterative Network, namely, VBIM-Net, to solve the full-wave ISPs with significantly improved structural rationality and inversion quality. The proposed VBIM-Net emulates the alternating updates of the total electric field and the contrast in the variational Born iterative method (VBIM) by multiple layers of subnetworks. We embed the analytical calculation of the contrast variation into each subnetwork, converting the scattered field residual into an approximate contrast variation and then enhancing it by a U-Net, thus avoiding the requirement of matched measurement dimension and grid resolution as in existing approaches. The total field and contrast of each layer's output is supervised in the loss function of VBIM-Net, imposing soft physical constraints on the variables in the subnetworks, which benefits the model's performance. In addition, we design a training scheme with extra noise to enhance the model's stability. Extensive numerical results on synthetic and experimental data both verify the inversion quality, generalization ability, and robustness of the proposed VBIM-Net. This work may provide some new inspiration for the design of efficient field-type DL schemes.</description>

      <title>Dissecting van der Waals interactions with Density Functional Theory -- Wannier-basis approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new scheme for the computation of dispersive interactions from first principles is presented. This cost-effective approach relies on a Wannier function representation compatible with density function theory descriptions. This is an electronic-based many-body method that captures the full electronic and optical response properties of the materials. It provides the foundation to discern van der Waals and induction energies as well as the role of anisotropy and different stacking patterns when computing dispersive interactions in systems. Calculated results for binding energies in benchmarked materials and layered materials, such as graphite, hBN, and MoS$_2$ give encouraging comparisons with available experimental data. Strategies for broadened computational descriptions of dispersive interactions are also discussed. Our investigation aims at stimulating new experimental studies to measure van der Waals energies in a wider range of materials, especially in layered systems.</description>

      <title>Transferable Boltzmann Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of equilibrium samples of molecular systems has been a long-standing problem in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators are a generative machine learning method that addresses this issue by learning a transformation via a normalizing flow from a simple prior distribution to the target Boltzmann distribution of interest. Recently, flow matching has been employed to train Boltzmann Generators for small molecular systems in Cartesian coordinates. We extend this work and propose a first framework for Boltzmann Generators that are transferable across chemical space, such that they predict zero-shot Boltzmann distributions for test molecules without being retrained for these systems. These transferable Boltzmann Generators allow approximate sampling from the target distribution of unseen systems, as well as efficient reweighting to the target Boltzmann distribution. The transferability of the proposed framework is evaluated on dipeptides, where we show that it generalizes efficiently to unseen systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed architecture enhances the efficiency of Boltzmann Generators trained on single molecular systems.</description>

      <title>CK-MPM: A Compact-Kernel Material Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Material Point Method (MPM) has become a cornerstone of physics-based simulation, widely used in geomechanics and computer graphics for modeling phenomena such as granular flows, viscoelasticity, fracture mechanics, etc. Despite its versatility, the original MPM suffers from cell-crossing instabilities caused by discontinuities in particle-grid transfer kernels. Existing solutions mostly mitigate these issues by adopting smoother shape functions, but at the cost of increased numerical diffusion and computational overhead due to larger kernel support. In this paper, we propose a novel $C^2$-continuous compact kernel for MPM that achieves a unique balance in terms of stability, accuracy, and computational efficiency. Our method integrates seamlessly with Affine Particle-In-Cell (APIC) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) MPM, while only doubling the number of grid nodes associated with each particle compared to linear kernels. At its core is an innovative dual-grid framework, which associates particles with grid nodes exclusively within the cells they occupy on two staggered grids, ensuring consistent and stable force computations. We demonstrate that our method can be conveniently implemented using a domain-specific language, Taichi, or based on open-source GPU MPM frameworks, achieving faster runtime and less numerical diffusion compared to quadratic B-spline MPM. Comprehensive validation through unit tests, comparative studies, and stress tests demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in conserving both linear and angular momentum, handling stiff materials, and scaling efficiently for large-scale simulations. Our results highlight the transformative potential of compact, high-order kernels in advancing MPM's capabilities for stable, accurate, and high-performance simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine machine-learning (ML) techniques with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and finite-size scaling (FSS) to study continuous and first-order phase transitions in Ising, Blume-Capel, and Ising-metamagnet spin models. We go beyond earlier studies that had concentrated on obtaining the correlation-length exponent $\nu$. In particular, we show (a) how to combine neural networks (NNs), trained with data from MC simulations of Ising-type spin models on finite lattices, with FSS to obtain both thermal magnetic exponents $y_t = 1/\nu$ and $y_h$, respectively, at both critical and tricritical points, (b) how to obtain the NN counterpart of two-scale-factor universality at an Ising-type critical point, and (c) FSS at a first-order transition. We also obtain the FSS forms for the output of our trained NNs as functions of both the temperature and the magnetic field.</description>
