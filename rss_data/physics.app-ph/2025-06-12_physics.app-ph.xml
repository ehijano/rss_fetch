      <title>Unification of Exceptional Points and Transmission Peak Degeneracies in a Highly Tunable Magnon-Photon Dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), spectral singularities arising in non-Hermitian dynamical systems, have drawn widespread attention for their potential to enhance sensor capability by leveraging characteristic square-root frequency splitting. However, the advantages of EP sensors have remained highly contested, primarily due to their inherent hypersensitivity to model errors and loss of precision arising from eigenbasis collapse, quantified by the Petermann noise factor. Recently, it has been suggested that practical sensor implementations should instead utilize transmission peak degeneracies (TPDs), which exhibit square-root transmission splitting while maintaining a complete eigenbasis, potentially mitigating the Petermann noise around EPs. This work presents a microwave magnon-photon dimer with near-universal tunability across all relevant parameters, which we use to investigate various TPDs experimentally. We demonstrate that two-dimensional EP and TPD configurations based on coupled oscillators can be unified into a general theory and experimental framework utilizing synthetic gauge fields, which we present and validate through careful experiments on two representative TPDs. We also introduce practical metrics to quantify the performance and robustness of TPDs beyond just the Petermann noise factor. Our formalism and experimental methods unify previous EP and TPD configurations and may lead to the realization of robust TPD-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin normal-shear-coupled metabarrier for low-frequency underwater sound insulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater noise pollution caused by anthropogenic activities, such as offshore wind farms, significantly affects marine life, hindering the intra- and inter-specific interactions of many aquatic species. A common strategy to mitigate these effects is to enclose the noise source within a physical barrier to achieve acceptable noise levels in the surrounding region. Underwater barriers typically achieve noise reduction through sound absorption based on locally resonant systems (e.g., foam and bubble elements) or sound reflecting systems (e.g., air bubble curtains). Although locally resonant-based solutions can yield significant noise attenuation levels, their performance is usually narrow-band. On the other hand, sound-reflecting systems require wider dimensions, presenting poor performance in the low-frequency range. Thus, significant low-frequency underwater noise attenuation remains an open issue, especially when considering thin structures that perform over a broad frequency range. In this work, we present the design of thin metamaterial-based acoustic barriers whose underwater noise attenuation is owed to tailored anisotropic material properties. A topology optimization approach is used to obtain a unit cell that maximizes the coupling between normal stresses and shear strains (and vice-versa). The resulting metabarrier presents a sub-wavelength thickness-to-wavelength ratio in the low-frequency range (circa 1/70 below 1 kHz) and also high sound transmission loss values at higher frequencies (almost 100 dB above 2 kHz). We also investigate the effects of increased hydrostatic pressure, presenting structural modifications that enable real-world applications. The results presented in this work indicate an efficient metamaterial-based solution for the mitigation of underwater noise, suggesting a fruitful direction for the exploitation of anisotropy in acoustic insulation applications.</description>

      <title>Ultra-lightweight multi-functional gyroid-based metamaterial for simultaneous sound insulation, vibration suppression, and impact mitigation in all directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-functional materials are increasingly essential in many applications due to their ability to serve multiple purposes, simultaneously. Metamaterials can offer tailored functionality based on carefully designed tessellating basic building blocks, or unit cells, in space. These unit cells are most commonly designed for a single objective, for example, to mitigate an impact, insulate sound, or dampen vibrations. However, a metamaterial that can mitigate impact, attenuate elastic vibrations, insulate airborne sound, while being ultra-light and ultra-stiff remains elusive. Here, we present three gyroid-based metamaterial designs, which are numerically and experimentally examined, that can simultaneously serve all these functions in all directions. Our designs have band gaps reaching 60% with as low as 367 Hz starting band gap frequency, while being up to 77% lighter than a homogeneous block of the same material. Our findings highlight the potential of metamaterials for applications that require wave manipulation, mechanical resilience, and impact mitigation with limited mass and volume, simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Engineering Cryogenic FETs: Addressing SCEs and Impact of Interface Traps Down to 2 K Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive design and benchmarking of cryogenic bulk-FET using a calibrated TCAD model integrating 2-D electrostatics and interface trap effects across temperatures from T = 2 K to 300 K. For a 28-nm node FET, transport appears predominately ballistic at T = 2 K, shifting toward quasi-ballistic transport with increasing temperature. Short-channel effects (SCEs) dominate cryogenic benefits at Lg = 25 nm for T &lt; 25 K, as evidenced by a modest improvement in the minimum subthreshold swing and threshold voltage roll-off with temperature in this range. Additionally, localized defects exacerbate SCEs, increasing the OFF current and subthreshold swing, while broader trap distributions yield higher carrier mobility. Higher trap densities amplify SCEs, degrade surface mobility, and worsen threshold voltage roll-off. This study also addresses the impact of technology scaling parameters, such as oxide thickness and gate length, on SCEs at cryogenic temperatures. The calibrated TCAD deck aligns closely with experimental data for low and high drain biases at T = 4.2 K, 77 K, and 300 K, providing robust methodologies for simulating and predicting the characteristics of short-channel cryogenic FETs. The detailed TCAD Sentaurus deck implementation methodology is explained, which can be further used to design low-temperature technologies. This work can serve as a guideline for optimizing technology nodes and channel/oxide scaling to achieve minimal SCEs, maximum ON/OFF ratio, and enhanced surface mobility.</description>

      <title>Current Crowding in a High-Efficiency Black Phosphorus Light-Emitting Diode Using a Reflective Back Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-performance mid-infrared (MIR) light-emitting diode (LED) based on a black phosphorus (b-P)/n-MoS$_2$ heterojunction. A gold back contact combined with a rhenium-doped n-type MoS$_2$ layer is used to enhance light extraction. The device shows a MIR peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of (1.6 $\pm$ 0.2) % at room temperature and a record (7.0 $\pm$ 0.5) % EQE at 77 K, with a maximum radiant power density of (108 $\pm$ 8) W/cm2. Finite-element simulations highlight the importance of phonon-assisted band-to-band tunneling under reverse bias and the influence of carrier velocity saturation under forward bias. The simulations also reveal that the high ideality factors extracted from the current-voltage characteristic are due to current crowding at the heterojunction and a consequence of the device geometry. These findings establish a new high-performance b-P LED architecture and provide crucial insights into the physics of MIR sources based on 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Conductivity Enhancement of Polymers Employing Microbubble Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of green methodologies for fabricating optoelectronic devices necessitates the adoption of self-assembly-based strategies to engineer efficient and sustainable platforms. Microbubble lithography (MBL) stands out as a directed self-assembly technique, enabling real-time micropatterning of conductive structures. Notably, this approach achieves significant enhancements in the conductivity of patterned polymers without requiring external dopants. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this enhancement remain poorly understood. In this study, we address this knowledge gap through a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of a binary polymer system. Molecular dynamics simulations and percolation theory reveal structural transformations that underpin improved charge transport. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phase separation at the interfaces of interacting polymers plays a pivotal role in enhancing conductivity. This separation optimizes the conformational states of the polymers, facilitating more efficient charge carrier transport and ultimately leading to higher conductivity. Our findings establish MBL-induced self-assembly as a robust and sustainable technique for fabricating conductive patterns, paving the way for its integration into next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tip-Based Proximity Ferroelectric Switching and Piezoelectric Response in Wurtzite Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material, which is unswitchable with an external field below the dielectric breakdown field, becomes a practically switchable ferroelectric in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer. Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the proximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in wurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using finite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains, the features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the Al1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers sandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of "proximity switching" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of "proximity suppression" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only two possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters and asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops depend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe. The physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe geometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to the polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous polarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the "otherwise unswitchable" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise non-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale control of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical applications.</description>

      <title>Reliability of Capacitive Read in Arrays of Ferroelectric Capacitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-destructive capacitance read-out of ferroelectric capacitors (FeCaps) based on doped HfO$_2$ metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) structures offers the potential for low-power and highly scalable crossbar arrays. This is due to a number of factors, including the selector-less design, the absence of sneak paths, the power-efficient charge-based read operation, and the reduced IR drop. Nevertheless, a reliable capacitive readout presents certain challenges, particularly in regard to device variability and the trade-off between read yield and read disturbances, which can ultimately result in bit-flips. This paper presents a digital read macro for HfO$_2$ FeCaps and provides design guidelines for capacitive readout of HfO$_2$ FeCaps, taking device-centric reliability and yield challenges into account. An experimentally calibrated physics-based compact model of HfO$_2$ FeCaps is employed to investigate the reliability of the read-out operation of the FeCap macro through Monte Carlo simulations. Based on this analysis, we identify limitations posed by the device variability and propose potential mitigation strategies through design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) of the FeCap device characteristics and the CMOS circuit design. Finally, we examine the potential applications of the FeCap macro in the context of secure hardware. We identify potential security threats and propose strategies to enhance the robustness of the system.</description>

      <title>Apparatus for the measurement of birefringence maps of optical materials: the case of crystalline silicon for Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is expected to achieve sensitivity improvements exceeding an order of magnitude compared to current gravitational-wave detectors. The rigorous characterization in optical birefringence of materials and coatings has become a critical task for next-generation detectors, especially since this birefringence is generally spatially non-uniform. A highly sensitive optical polarimeter has been developed at the Department of Physics and Earth Sciences of the University of Ferrara and INFN - Ferrara Section, Italy, aimed at performing two-dimensional birefringence mapping of substrates. In this paper we describe the design and working principle of the system and present results for crystalline silicon, a candidate material for substrates in the low-frequency (LF) interferometers of ET. We find that the birefringence is of order $10^{-7}$ for commercially available samples and is position dependent in the silicon (100)-oriented samples, with variations in both magnitude and axis orientation. We also measure the intrinsic birefringence of the (110) surface. Implications for the performance of gravitational-wave interferometers are discussed.</description>

      <title>Mathematical proof of errors in Capasso's excess noise factor formula for an n-step staircase multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state devices such as multistep staircase avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are analogues to the photomultiplier tubes and are considered as a cascade-amplifier. The major source of internal noise in these APDs is due to the randomness in their stepwise impact ionization. Recent literature on staircase APDs by research groups such as Campbell and co-workers have reported the theoretical estimates of total excess noise factors using Capasso's excess noise factor formula. This formula is based on Friis' total noise factor formula for cascade networks. This article proves that Capasso's formula for a staircase APD, erroneously considers the power gains in Friis' total noise factor formula as the gains.</description>

      <title>Rock-salt ScN(113) layers grown on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides constitute a versatile class of materials with diverse properties and wide-ranging applications. Exploring new surface orientations and uncovering novel properties can enable innovative material configurations with tailored functionalities for device integration. Here, we report the growth and characterization of (85-210)-nm-thick undoped ScN layers on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$$(10\bar{1}0)$ templates via plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirm a pure (113) surface orientation with rotational twins. Two distinct in-plane relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ have been identified: the dominant $[1\bar{1}0]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[33\bar{2}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ (under tensile-compression), and the less prevalent $[\bar{1}\bar{2}1]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[7\bar{4}\bar{1}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ (under biaxial compression). Broad photoluminescence spectra with a peak emission energy of $\approx 2.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ originate from the lowest direct gap at the $\mathbf{X}$ point of the ScN band structure. Temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements (4-380 K) reveal that impurity band conduction dominates. The electron mobility is primarily limited by optical phonon scattering, characterized by an effective phonon energy of $(60 \pm 3)\,\mathrm{meV}$.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Dynamic Metasurface Antenna Wireless System: Prototype, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising hybrid analog/digital beamforming technology to realize next-generation wireless systems with low cost, footprint, and power consumption. The research on DMA-empowered wireless systems is still at an early stage, mostly limited to theoretical studies under simplifying assumptions on the one hand and a few antenna-level experiments on the other hand. Substantial knowledge gaps arise from the lack of complete end-to-end DMA-empowered wireless system prototypes. In addition, recently unveiled benefits of strong inter-element mutual coupling (MC) in DMAs remain untapped. Here, we demonstrate a K-band prototype of an end-to-end wireless system based on a DMA with strong inter-element MC. To showcase the flexible control over the DMA's radiation pattern, we present an experimental case study of simultaneously steering a beam to a desired transmitter and a null to an undesired jammer, achieving up to 43~dB discrimination. Using software-defined radios, we transmit and receive QPSK OFDM waveforms to evaluate the bit error rate. We also discuss algorithmic and technological challenges associated with envisioned future evolutions of our end-to-end testbed and real-life DMA-based wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced directional transport in extended SSH chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Friis noise factor formulas for cascade networks</title>

Abstract: The signal-to-noise ratio of a multistage cascade network is often estimated using the well-known Friis' formulas for noise factors (or the noise figures in decibels). However, this article addresses the major errors in Friis' noise factor formulas for higher stages. Additionally, we re-derive the correct formulas to calculate the stage-wise noise factors for cascade networks from the basic definition of noise factors. We then present a comparison of our derived formulas with Friis' noise factor formulas. Contrary to Friis' formula, we define the total noise factor of an n-stage cascade network as the product of its stage-wise noise factors. We further validate our derived formulas for a cascade network by correlating them with the expressions for a staircase avalanche photodiode.</description>

      <title>Design and Reprogrammability of Zero Modes in 2D Materials from a Single Element</title>

Abstract: Mechanical extremal materials, a class of metamaterials that exist at the bounds of elastic theory, possess the extraordinary capability to engineer any desired elastic behavior by harnessing mechanical zero modes -- deformation modes that demand minimal or, ideally, no elastic energy. However, the potential for arbitrary construction and reprogramming of metamaterials remains largely unrealized, primarily due to significant challenges in qualitatively transforming zero modes within the confines of existing metamaterial design frameworks. This work presents a method for explicitly defining and in situ reprogramming zero modes of two-dimensional extremal materials by employing straight-line mechanisms (SLMs) and planar symmetry, which prescribe and coordinate the zero modes, respectively. We validate the concept experimentally on square-symmetric lattices and corroborate its generality for hexagonal lattices through finite-element analysis, together spanning the full theoretical gamut of extremal behaviors. The method is used to design, test, and reprogram centimeter-scale isotropic, orthotropic, and chiral extremal materials by reorienting the SLMs in place, enabling these materials to smoothly and reversibly interpolate between extremal modalities (e.g., unimode to bimode), material properties (e.g., negative to positive Poisson's ratios), and selectively enable chirality without changing the metamaterial's global structure. This methodology provides a straightforward and explicit strategy for the design and tuning of all varieties of two-dimensional extremal materials, enabling dynamic mechanical metamaterial construction to completely cover the gamut of elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Characteristic transition of the dominant power loss from diffractive to ohmic in overmoded and periodically loaded waveguides at high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of electromagnetic fields in cylindrical waveguiding structures that contain periodic ring loading, whether for applications in charged-particle accelerators or radiation transportation, has been traditionally conducted under simplifying limits, where the structure is either single-moded at the lower-frequency limit or overmoded at high-frequency limit. These limits have often allowed us to find spectral (modal) expansions for the fields under simpler analytical and computational conditions, with ohmic effects typically being the dominant power loss mechanism in the lower limit, while diffraction effects dominate the loss in the higher limit. In this Letter, we report the observation of a transition point in the character of the main loss mechanism, where ohmic loss becomes dominant in a structure typically presumed to be dominated by diffraction loss. The results follow a formal analysis for the scattered vector fields in a highly overmoded THz waveguide. The findings bridge between the traditional theoretical descriptions for the two limits and reveal key tradeoffs that inform experiments for the transportation of THz radiation over long distances.</description>

      <title>All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.</description>
