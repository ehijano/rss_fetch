      <title>Monotonicity versus positivity in modal logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a logic L has the Lyndon positivity property (LPP) if all formulas which are monotone in L (that is, are preserved under increasing the valuation on L-algebras) are L-equivalent to positive formulas (formulas without negation and implication symbols). In the present paper, we investigate LPP in propositional monotone modal logics. First, we transfer Lyndon's result from classical predicate calculus and prove LPP for all normal modal logics with the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP). Then we prove that all logics between K4.3 and S4.3 do not have LPP. We also show that among tabular extensions of S4 there are infinitely many logics with LPP and infinitely many logics without this property. Finally, we prove that all canonical monotone modal logics which are preserved under bisimulation products have both LIP and LPP. In particular, we show LIP and LPP for all logics that are axiomatizable over the minimal monotone logic EM by means of closed formulas and formulas of the form A(p) -&gt; &lt;&gt;p, where A is positive.</description>

      <title>Categoricity for inferential $\omega$-logic and $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides two extensions of first order logic by `$\omega$-rules'. In each case we characterize the countable structures whose theory in the logic is categorical (has a unique model). In the one-sorted inferential $\omega$-logic, both Robinson's system $Q$ and Peano Arithmetic become categorical. In the two-sorted generalized $\omega$-logic we show
  each complete $L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ sentence defines the same class of structures as a first-order theory with the appropriate $G-\omega$-rule. These logics are much weaker than second order logic and we argue that they do not appeal to the arithmetical concepts that the categoricity theorems themselves aim to secure. The results depend on proving that the inferential rules for the logics are categorical, i.e. they uniquely determine certain truth-conditions for the logical connectives and quantifiers. We provide an extensive answer to the doxological challenge (on referential determinacy) proposed in \cite{ButtonWalshbook} and we develop a philosophical view of mathematics -which we call {\em cognitive modelism}- according to which classical mathematics is best understood as a complex process of constructing and developing a distinctive class of concepts, rather than merely describing a fixed pre-existing realm of structures.

      <title>A vector logic for intensional formal semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal semantics and distributional semantics are distinct approaches to linguistic meaning: the former models meaning as reference via model-theoretic structures; the latter represents meaning as vectors in high-dimensional spaces shaped by usage. This paper proves that these frameworks are structurally compatible for intensional semantics. We establish that Kripke-style intensional models embed injectively into vector spaces, with semantic functions lifting to (multi)linear maps that preserve composition. The construction accommodates multiple index sorts (worlds, times, locations) via a compound index space, representing intensions as linear operators. Modal operators are derived algebraically: accessibility relations become linear operators, and modal conditions reduce to threshold checks on accumulated values. For uncountable index domains, we develop a measure-theoretic generalization in which necessity becomes truth almost everywhere and possibility becomes truth on a set of positive measure, a non-classical logic natural for continuous parameters.</description>

      <title>Computational techniques for sheaf cohomology of locally profinite sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the sheaf cohomology with constant $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients of a concrete class of locally profinite sets of independent interest. We introduce $k$-Fubini partitions to aid in constructions, which witness a failure of a Fubini theorem analog for these spaces. It is also shown that questions of intermediate cohomology degrees can be reduced to questions about top cohomology degrees by exhibiting nontrivial top cocycles as pointwise limits of coboundaries.</description>

      <title>On some NIP Fragments of Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study sets of NIP formulas in some theories of fields and valued fields, with a special focus on the sets of quantifier-free and existential formulas. First, we give a new proof of the fact that Separably Closed Valued Fields of any characteristic and any imperfection degree are NIP, and use this result to fill some gaps of a proof of the so-called NIP Transfer Theorem for henselian valued fields of equal characteristic. Second, we prove a variant of a theorem of Johnson: every positive characteristic valued field whose existential formulas are NIP is henselian. Finally, we set the ground for the finer question of transfer of NIP formulas of valued fields with bounded quantifier rank. Namely, we prove that for any henselian equicharacteristic valued field, any formula of quantifier rank at most $n\geq 1$ is NIP if and only if the same is true for the residue field and the value group, provided that the valued field is separably defectless Kaplansky and conditional on a multi-variable generalization of a well known statement about indiscernible sequences of singletons in ac-valued fields.</description>

      <title>Forcing and classes of $\mathsf{HYP}$-dominating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is aimed at showing separations between three subsets of $\omega^{\omega}$, namely $\mathsf{HYP}\text{-}\mathsf{SNE}$, $\mathsf{HYP}\text{-}\mathsf{SME}$, and $\mathsf{HYP}\text{-}\mathsf{DOM}$. These classes are natural computational analogues of cardinal characteristics from Cichon's diagram and are known to satisfy $\mathsf{HYP}\text{-}\mathsf{SNE} \subseteq \mathsf{HYP}\text{-}\mathsf{SME} \subseteq \mathsf{HYP}\text{-}\mathsf{DOM}$. To show that both of these inclusions are strict we introduce effectivizations of Laver and Hechler forcing, which we believe are of independent interest. Our techniques allow us to show similar results relative to any Turing ideal closed under $\leq_{\mathsf{HYP}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study three conditions that control the behaviour of isotropy in \'etale groupoids, and their relationships under the additional assumptions of second-countability and Hausdorffness. We examine a number of examples that show these properties are distinct. Working under the assumption of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms, excluding choice, we then examine an alternate characterization of topological freeness, first introduced by Anantharaman-Delaroche, in the non-Hausdorff setting. Finally, we prove an equivalence between the Baire Category Theorem and an \'etale groupoid theorem, along with similar equivalences to other weakenings of the Axiom of Choice.</description>

      <title>Nonstandard free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpretation of a structure $\mathbb A$ in $\mathbb B$ allows to produce structures elementarily equivalent to $\mathbb A$ given those elementarily equivalent to $\mathbb B$. In particular, interpretation of the free group in $\mathbb N$ enables us to introduce and study a family of elementary free groups, which we call nonstandard free groups. More generally, for a wide class of groups we introduce nonstandard models arising from interpretation in $\mathbb N$. We exploit interpretation to show that under mild assumptions, ultrapowers of a group can be viewed as nonstandard models of that group. This leads us to describe the structure of the ultrapowers in terms of structure of nonstandard models of natural numbers, offering insight into a longstanding question of Malcev. We also introduce fundamentals of nonstandard combinatorial group theory such as the notions of nonstandard subgroups, nonstandard normal subgroups, and nonstandard group presentations.</description>

      <title>Dismantling the Surprise Test "Paradox"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following story: A teacher announces to her students a test for the following week, such that the test will be ``surprising''. The students use this as the basis for a ``logical derivation'' and reach a contradiction, which they (falsely) interpret as saying that there cannot be a test. The teacher gives a test e.g. on Wednesday, ``surprising'' the students. Its curious turns give the story the flavor of a paradox. Alternative names are the {\it unexpected hanging paradox\/} and the {\it prediction paradox}. Discussions and analyses of the story in the philosophical and mathematical literature are abundant, spanning 80 years until today. Apparently, none of the known explanations has been generally accepted as conclusive. We offer a fresh view, in propositional logic. ``Surprise'' is captured as unprovability of a certain formula from some axiom system. ``Knowledge'' corresponds to axiom systems and can be gained by mathematical proofs. The notorious property of self-reference in the announcement is cleanly accommodated. All errors made by the students are identified. A general analysis shows that the students cannot learn anything from the announcement. This is the first mathematically precise analysis of the story that shows that self-reference, full power of mathematical proofs, and truthfulness of the teacher can consistently coexist. The ``paradox'' vanishes. In order to facilitate comparisons with treatments using modal logic a version based on system S5 is also given. A formula $\sigma$ is identified that formalizes ``there will be a surprising test'', and it is shown that the students take the announcement to mean $\square\sigma$ while in fact the information conveyed by it is not stronger than $\diamond\sigma$. This dissolves all contradictions or ``paradoxical'' issues.</description>

      <title>Club guessing and the universal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0608330</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0608330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the use of club guessing and other pcf constructs in the context of showing that a given partially ordered class of objects does not have a largest, or a universal element. The article was published in 2006. On rereading we noticed a missing parameter in Definition 1.1, which makes the rest the recounting of the Kojman-Shelah incorrect. We correct the (minor) error in this version, changes marked in red.</description>

      <title>On the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras in continuous model theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical model theory, the Keisler-Shelah theorem establishes a fundamental connection between the elementary equivalence of structures and the isomorphism of their ultrapowers. Motivated by this, one may ask whether an analogous relationship holds in the framework of continuous model theory, which naturally encompasses metric structures such as $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras. In this paper, we investigate the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of operator algebras from a model-theoretic perspective. We prove that, assuming the negation of the continuum hypothesis, there exist two elementarily equivalent infinite-dimensional unital $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras $A$ and $B$ of size $\le \mathfrak c$ such that for all non-principal ultrafilters $\mathcal U, \mathcal V$ on $\omega$, the ultrapowers $A^{\mathcal U}$ and $B^{\mathcal V}$ are not isomorphic. This result provides a continuous analogue of certain classical theorems concerning ultraproducts and demonstrates that the model-theoretic behavior of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras is closely related to set-theoretic principles such as the Continuum Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>The Logical Structure of Physical Laws: A Fixed Point Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formalise the self-referential definition of physical laws using monotone operators on a lattice of theories, resolving the pathologies of naive set-theoretic formulations. By invoking Tarski fixed point theorem, we identify physical theories as the least fixed points of admissibility constraints derived from Galois connections. We demonstrate that QED and GR can be represented in such a logical structure with respect to their symmetry and locality principles.</description>
