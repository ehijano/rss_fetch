      <title>Action potential dynamics on heterogenous neural networks: from kinetic to macroscopic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of multi-agent systems of binary interacting particles, a kinetic model for action potential dynamics on a neural network is proposed, accounting for heterogeneity in the neuron-to-neuron connections, as well as in the brain structure. Two levels of description are coupled: in a single area, pairwise neuron interactions for the exchange of membrane potential are statistically described; among different areas, a graph description of the brain network topology is included. Equilibria of the kinetic and macroscopic settings are determined and numerical simulations of the system dynamics are performed with the aim of studying the influence of the network heterogeneities on the membrane potential propagation and synchronization.</description>

      <title>Shape matters: Inferring the motility of confluent cells from static images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell motility in dense cell collectives is pivotal in various diseases like cancer metastasis and asthma. A central aspect in these phenomena is the heterogeneity in cell motility, but identifying the motility of individual cells is challenging. Previous work has established the importance of the average cell shape in predicting cell dynamics. Here, we aim to identify the importance of individual cell shape features, rather than collective features, to distinguish between high-motility (active) and low-motility (passive) cells in heterogeneous cell layers. Employing the Cellular Potts Model, we generate simulation snapshots and extract static features as inputs for a simple machine-learning model. Our results show that when the passive cells are non-motile, this machine-learning model can accurately predict whether a cell is passive or active using only single-cell shape features. Furthermore, we explore scenarios where passive cells also exhibit some degree of motility, albeit less than active cells. In such cases, our findings indicate that a neural network trained on shape features can accurately classify cell motility, particularly when the number of active cells is low, and the motility of active cells is significantly higher compared to passive cells. This work offers potential for physics-inspired predictions of single-cell properties with implications for inferring cell dynamics from static histological images.</description>

      <title>Information theory, Signal Analysis and Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book is intended for teaching Signal Analysis methods and Inverse Problems theory. It is completely open access and will remain free. It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. A French version is also available. The MATLAB codes we used can be found at the following address: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/ndi2fs3yyup64i8xyzjqd/matlab_book.zip?rlkey=j112lo5kaxvinh362frc66bcl&amp;st=enxxx1ps&amp;dl=0</description>

      <title>Universal mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Thermodynamically favourable reactions such as ATP hydrolysis are used by the cell to convert chemical energy into useful structure, function, and mechanical work. This includes the `fuelled' catalysis of chemical reactions that would otherwise be thermodynamically unfavourable. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. Here, we present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. By considering the different aspects of the dynamics, such as the interplay of the non-equilibrium drive and the geometry of the enzyme-substrate complex, we propose three golden rules that should be universally applicable for de novo design of enzymes, as they are based on generic ingredients and physical constraints. These rules lead to optimal combinations of parameters, which can vastly accelerate reactions, while at the same time decreasing the energy dissipation of the combined reaction process, or, in other words, to an efficient enzyme. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is vital for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models, especially in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with the nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex gene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of quantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear expression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles in the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with more linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method, powered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that traditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.</description>
