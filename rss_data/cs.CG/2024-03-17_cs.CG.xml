      <title>Ipelets for the Convex Polygonal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many structures, both classical and modern, involving convex polygonal geometries whose deeper understanding would be facilitated through interactive visualizations. The Ipe extensible drawing editor, developed by Otfried Cheong, is a widely used software system for generating geometric figures. One of its features is the capability to extend its functionality through programs called Ipelets. In this media submission, we showcase a collection of new Ipelets that construct a variety of geometric objects based on polygonal geometries. These include Macbeath regions, metric balls in the forward and reverse Funk distance, metric balls in the Hilbert metric, polar bodies, the minimum enclosing ball of a point set, and minimum spanning trees in both the Funk and Hilbert metrics. We also include a number of utilities on convex polygons, including union, intersection, subtraction, and Minkowski sum (previously implemented as a CGAL Ipelet). All of our Ipelets are programmed in Lua and are freely available.</description>

      <title>The Euclidean MST-ratio for Bi-colored Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite set, $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, and a subset, $B \subseteq A$, the \emph{MST-ratio} is the combined length of the minimum spanning trees of $B$ and $A \setminus B$ divided by the length of the minimum spanning tree of $A$.
  The question of the supremum, over all sets $A$, of the maximum, over all subsets $B$, is related to the Steiner ratio, and we prove this sup-max is between $2.154$ and $2.427$.
  Restricting ourselves to $2$-dimensional lattices, we prove that the sup-max is $2.0$, while the inf-max is $1.25$.
  By some margin the most difficult of these results is the upper bound for the inf-max, which we prove by showing that the hexagonal lattice cannot have MST-ratio larger than $1.25$.</description>

      <title>A canonical tree decomposition for order types, and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a notion of decomposition of planar point sets (or rather of their chirotopes) as trees decorated by smaller chirotopes. This decomposition is based on the concept of mutually avoiding sets (which we rephrase as \emph{modules}), and adapts in some sense the modular decomposition of graphs in the world of chirotopes. The associated tree always exists and is unique up to some appropriate constraints. We also show how to compute the number of triangulations of a chirotope efficiently, starting from its tree and the (weighted) numbers of triangulations of its parts.</description>

      <title>The Information Geometry of UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we highlight some connections of UMAP to the basic principles of Information Geometry. Originally, UMAP was derived from Category Theory observations. However, we posit that it also has a natural geometric interpretation.</description>
