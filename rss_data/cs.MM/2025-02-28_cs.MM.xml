      <title>Knowledge Bridger: Towards Training-free Missing Multi-modality Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous successful approaches to missing modality completion rely on carefully designed fusion techniques and extensive pre-training on complete data, which can limit their generalizability in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. In this study, we pose a new challenge: can we develop a missing modality completion model that is both resource-efficient and robust to OOD generalization? To address this, we present a training-free framework for missing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our approach, termed the "Knowledge Bridger", is modality-agnostic and integrates generation and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific priors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available modalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the missing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in high-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across both general and medical domains show that our approach consistently outperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally, our knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority over variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering insights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.</description>

      <title>Image Referenced Sketch Colorization Based on Animation Creation Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sketch colorization plays an important role in animation and digital illustration production tasks. However, existing methods still meet problems in that text-guided methods fail to provide accurate color and style reference, hint-guided methods still involve manual operation, and image-referenced methods are prone to cause artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion-based framework inspired by real-world animation production workflows. Our approach leverages the sketch as the spatial guidance and an RGB image as the color reference, and separately extracts foreground and background from the reference image with spatial masks. Particularly, we introduce a split cross-attention mechanism with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) modules. They are trained separately with foreground and background regions to control the corresponding embeddings for keys and values in cross-attention. This design allows the diffusion model to integrate information from foreground and background independently, preventing interference and eliminating the spatial artifacts. During inference, we design switchable inference modes for diverse use scenarios by changing modules activated in the framework. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, along with user studies, demonstrate our advantages over existing methods in generating high-qualigy artifact-free results with geometric mismatched references. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component. Codes are available at https://github.com/ tellurion-kanata/colorizeDiffusion.</description>

      <title>MetaDesigner: Advancing Artistic Typography Through AI-Driven, User-Centric, and Multilingual WordArt Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19859v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MetaDesigner introduces a transformative framework for artistic typography synthesis, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and grounded in a user-centric design paradigm. Its foundation is a multi-agent system comprising the Pipeline, Glyph, and Texture agents, which collectively orchestrate the creation of customizable WordArt, ranging from semantic enhancements to intricate textural elements. A central feedback mechanism leverages insights from both multimodal models and user evaluations, enabling iterative refinement of design parameters. Through this iterative process, MetaDesigner dynamically adjusts hyperparameters to align with user-defined stylistic and thematic preferences, consistently delivering WordArt that excels in visual quality and contextual resonance. Empirical evaluations underscore the system's versatility and effectiveness across diverse WordArt applications, yielding outputs that are both aesthetically compelling and context-sensitive.</description>
