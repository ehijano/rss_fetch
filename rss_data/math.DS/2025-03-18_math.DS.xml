      <title>On the records and zeros of a deterministic random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle two questions on sequence A120243 in the OEIS that were raised by Clark Kimberling and partly solve a conjecture of Van de Lune and Arias de Reyna. We extend Kimberling's questions to the framework of deterministic random walks, automatic sequences, and linear recurrences. Our results indicate that there may be a deeper connection between these structures. In particular, we conjecture that the records of deterministic random walks are $\xi$-Ostrowski automatic for a quadratic rotation number $\xi$.</description>

      <title>Solenoids of Split Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solenoids induced by split sequences are introduced, as the inverse limit object of a sequence of fold maps. The topology of a solenoid is explored, and it is established that solenoids have naturally arising singular foliated structures. Our main purpose is to answer the question: "When is a solenoid minimal, both in a topological sense, and a measure theoretic sense?" To aid this, we introduce the notions of leaves, partial leaves and transversals of a solenoid and explore their properties. A combinatorial criterion for topological minimality of a solenoid, is constructed. When a given solenoid X doesn't contain finite partial leaves, the space of transverse measures of X, is proven to be equal to the inverse limit of a certain sequence of linear maps on convex cones. We conclude with providing a combinatorial criterion called "Semi-Normality" that allows us to recognize a wide class of uniquely ergodic solenoids.</description>

      <title>On the exponential synchronization for the asymmetric second-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the synchronization problem of nonuniform second-order Kuramoto model with homogeneous dampings and frustration effects on an asymmetric network. More precisely, we focus on the second order model defined on an asymmetric graph with depth no greater than two and present theories on the complete frequency synchronization. Due to the absence of the gradient flow structure, we develop novel energy functions to control the diameters of phase and frequency respectively, which allows us to construct first-order Gronwall-type inequalities. This eventually gives rise to the exponential convergence to the synchronized state in a regime in terms of large coupling strength, small inertia and frustration.</description>

      <title>A parameterization method for quasi-periodic systems with noise: computation of random invariant tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is devoted to studying normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) for a class of quasi-periodically forced systems subject to additional stochastic noise. These systems can be understood as skew-product systems. The existence of NHIMs is established by developing a parameterization method in random settings and applying the Implicit Function Theorem in appropriate Banach spaces. Based on this, we propose a numerical algorithm to compute the statistics of NHIMs and Lyapunov exponents.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and canards in two coupled FitzHugh--Nagumo equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the slow-fast dynamics of two FitzHugh--Nagumo equations coupled symmetrically through the slow equations. We find an open set of parameter values for which the two equations synchronise, and another set with antisynchrony -- where the solution of one equation is minus the solution of the other. We also obtain bistability -- where these two types of solution coexist as attractors.
  Canards are shown to give rise to mixed-mode oscillations. They also initiate small amplitude transient oscillations before the onset of large amplitude relaxation oscillations. We also discuss briefly the effect of asymmetric coupling, with periodic forcing of one of the equations by the other.</description>

      <title>On bandgap sensitivity to three-to-one internal resonances between acoustic and optical waves in metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear equations governing wave propagation across a metamaterial consisting of a cellular periodic structure hosting resonators with linear and cubic springs. The resulting system of two coupled equations with cubic nonlinearity is Hamiltonian, with the origin being an elliptic equilibrium characterized by two distinct linear frequencies associated with the acoustic and optical wave modes. Understanding this complex wave propagation problem requires the explicit derivation of analytical formulas for the nonlinear frequencies as functions of the relevant physical parameters. In the small wave amplitude regime and away from internal resonances, by using Hamiltonian Perturbation Theory, we obtain the first-order nonlinear correction to the linear frequencies. Additionally, we analytically estimate the threshold for the applicability of the perturbative solution, identifying the maximum admissible amplitude at which the obtained formulas remain valid. This threshold decreases significantly in the presence of internal resonances, particularly when the ratio between the optical and acoustic frequencies is close to 3 due to a 3:1 resonance which affects the correction. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the remainder after the first step of the perturbation scheme. The specific application deals with the wave propagation equations obtained for metamaterial honeycombs with periodically distributed nonlinear one-dof resonators. Our analysis provides quantitative insights into how internal resonances affect the bandgap. Specifically, we identify a 3:1 resonant curve in the parameter space represented by the resonator modal mass and stiffness. We also identify a region away from the above resonant curve where the nonlinear bandgap for softening resonators springs is significantly larger than the linear counterpart.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) to manage a target population has been the focus of numerous recent scientific studies. The present work focuses on a feedback law that depends linearly on the state variables of the SIT control system. We provide both mathematical proof and numerical illustrations demonstrating the global asymptotic stability of the population to zero when releasing a number of sterile insects proportional to different state variables of the SIT model.</description>

      <title>Beyond Classical Diffusion: Fractional Derivatives in Transport and Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integer-order differential operators were originally used to describe local and isotropic effects, in both space and time. However, in fields like biology, the modelling of complex phenomena with spatial heterogeneity necessitates more advanced approaches. The fractional calculus framework provides powerful tools for developing models that better capture the intricate dynamics of biological systems. This paper derives fractional reaction-diffusion equations from continuous-time random walks, highlighting the role of heavy-tailed distributions in the process. Both fractional partial differential equations, on the macroscopic level, as well as fractional stochastic differential equations, on the microscopic level, will be derived and simulated from, for simple Riesz-fractional diffusion models. A new numerical scheme that implements periodic boundary conditions is proposed to control the loss of mass density. We highlight the key differences between fractional and classical diffusion.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov functions for Morse-Smale synchronisation diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical system governing the phase differences between three identical oscillators arranged symmetrically and coupled by burst interactions. By constructing a discrete Lyapunov function, we prove the existence of two asymptotically stable fixed points on the 2-torus T^2, which correspond to Huygens synchronisation of three clocks. The locked states have phase differences of (2 pi/3,4 pi/3) and (4 pi/3,2 pi/3). Each fixed point possesses an open basin of attraction. The closure of the union of the basins of attraction of the two asymptotically stable attractors is the torus T^2, implying that Huygens synchronisation occurs generically and with full Lebesgue measure with respect to initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Diffusion for Biomechanical Dynamical Systems Through Local Manifold Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mutually aligned diffusion framework for cross-modal biomechanical motion generation, guided by a dynamical systems perspective. By treating each modality, e.g., observed joint angles ($X$) and ground reaction forces ($Y$), as complementary observations of a shared underlying locomotor dynamical system, our method aligns latent representations at each diffusion step, so that one modality can help denoise and disambiguate the other. Our alignment approach is motivated by the fact that local time windows of $X$ and $Y$ represent the same phase of an underlying dynamical system, thereby benefiting from a shared latent manifold. We introduce a simple local latent manifold alignment (LLMA) strategy that incorporates first-order and second-order alignment within the latent space for robust cross-modal biomechanical generation without bells and whistles. Through experiments on multimodal human biomechanics data, we show that aligning local latent dynamics across modalities improves generation fidelity and yields better representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems is essential in many fields, but applying machine learning techniques is often challenging due to incomplete or noisy data. This study introduces a variant of stochastic interpolation (SI) for probabilistic forecasting, estimating future states as distributions rather than single-point predictions. We explore its mathematical foundations and demonstrate its effectiveness on various dynamical systems, including the challenging WeatherBench dataset.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of reduced $C^*$-algebras associated with higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>

      <title>On Ma\~n\'e's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system and a infnite dimensional magnetic Hopf-Rinow theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, the magnetic two-component Hunter-Saxton system (M2HS). This system is formulated as a magnetic geodesic equation on an infinite-dimensional Lie group equipped with a right-invariant metric, the $\dot{H}^1$ -metric, which is closely related to the infinite-dimensional Fisher-Rao metric, and the derivative of an infinite-dimensional contact-type form as the magnetic field. We define Ma\~n\'e's critical value for exact magnetic systems on Hilbert manifolds in full generality and compute it explicitly for the (M2HS). Moreover, we establish an infinite-dimensional Hopf-Rinow theorem for this magnetic system, where Ma\~n\'e's critical value serves as the threshold beyond which the Hopf-Rinow theorem no longer holds. This geometric framework enables us to thoroughly analyze the blow-up behavior of solutions to the (M2HS). Using this insight, we extend solutions beyond blow-up by introducing and proving the existence of global conservative weak solutions. This extension is facilitated by extending the Madelung transform from an isometry into a magnetomorphism, embedding the magnetic system into a magnetic system on an infinite-dimensional sphere equipped with the derivative of the standard contact form as the magnetic field. Crucially, this setup can always be reduced, via a dynamical reduction theorem, to a totally magnetic three-sphere, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce to spectral noncommutative geometry the notion of tangled spectral triple, which encompasses the anisotropies arising in parabolic geometry as well as the parabolic commutator bounds arising in so-called ``bad Kasparov products''. Tangled spectral triples incorporate anisotropy by replacing the unbounded operator in a spectral triple that mimics a Dirac operator with several unbounded operators mimicking directional Dirac operators. We allow for varying and dependent orders in different directions, controlled by using the tools of tropical combinatorics. We study the conformal equivariance of tangled spectral triples as well as how they fit into $K$-homology by means of producing higher order spectral triples. Our main examples are hypoelliptic spectral triples constructed from Rockland complexes on parabolic geometries; we also build spectral triples on nilpotent group $C^*$-algebras from the dual Dirac element and crossed product spectral triples for parabolic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Stability of Geopolymer Activator Solutions for Optimised Synthesis through Thermodynamic Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers are an emerging class of binding materials used in sustainable cements, concretes, and composites. However, despite growing research, the lack of standardised processes and stability analyses for formulating activator solutions - a crucial component of geopolymer systems - remains a barrier to quality control and research advancement. This study presents an experimentally validated energy balance with thermodynamic phenomenon mathematically modelled for synthesising consistent geopolymer activator solutions. The model's general applicability enables dynamic assessments of user-specified systems, offering stability metrics for quality control in laboratory and industrial settings. Fundamentally, the mathematical model can be used towards batching optimisation under user-defined conditions where dissolution of geopolymer precursors can be maximised via solution preparation and batching optimisation. The model results quantify experimentally validated temperature dynamics, thermodynamic stability, and process design/batching optimisation, challenging traditional practices in the literature that rely on undefined equilibration periods. Key findings demonstrate that stable, ready-to-use activator solutions can be achieved in as little as 1 minute, compared to the typically used 24-hour batching periods. This research paves the way towards standardised activator solution preparation and supports the development of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for geopolymer synthesis, promoting consistency and scalability in geopolymer technology.</description>

      <title>Crisis in time-dependent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems operate in a fluctuating environment. However, even in low-dimensional setups, transitions and bifurcations have not yet been fully understood. In this Letter we focus on crises, a sudden flooding of the phase space due to the crossing of the boundary of the basin of attraction. We find that crises occur also in non-autonomous systems although the underlying mechanism is more complex. We show that in the vicinity of the transition, the escape probability scales as $\exp[-\alpha (\ln \delta)^2]$, where $\delta$ is the distance from the critical point, while $\alpha$ is a model-dependent parameter. This prediction is tested and verified in a few different systems, including the Kuramoto model with inertia, where the crisis controls the loss of stability of a chimera state.</description>

      <title>Groupoids, equivalence bibundles and bimodules for noncommutative solenoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number and $\mathcal{S}_p$ the $p$-solenoid. For $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Q}_p$ we consider in this paper a naturally associated action groupoid $S_\alpha:=\mathbb{Z} [1/p]\ltimes_\alpha \mathcal{S}_p \rightrightarrows \mathcal{S}_p$ whose $C^*-$algebra is a model for the noncommutative solenoid $\mathcal{A}_\alpha^\mathscr{S}$ studied by Latremoli\`ere and Packer. Following the geometric ideas of Connes and Rieffel to describe the Morita equivalences of noncommutative torus using the Kronecker foliation on the torus, we give an explicit description of the geometric/topologic equivalence bibundle for groupoids $S_\alpha$ and $S_\beta$ whenever $\alpha,\beta\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Q}_p$ are in the same orbit of the $GL_2(\mathbb{Z}[1/p])$ action by linear fractional transformations. As a corollary, for $\alpha,\beta\in \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{Q}_p$ as above we get an explicit description of the imprimitivity bimodules for the associated noncommutative solenoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of complex dynamics in a system of coupled dissipative kicked rotors and show that critical transitions can be understood via bifurcations of simple states. We study multistability and bifurcations in the single rotor model, demonstrating how these give rise to a variety of coexisting spatial patterns in a coupled system. A combined order parameter is introduced to characterize different spatial patterns and to reveal the coexistence of chaotic and regular attractors. Finally, we illustrate an intermittent phenomenon near the onset of chaos.</description>

      <title>Entire functions with Cantor bouquet Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03284v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hyperbolic transcendental entire function with connected Fatou set is said to be of disjoint type. It is known that the Julia set of a disjoint-type function of finite order is a Cantor bouquet; in particular, it is a collection of arcs (''hairs''), each connecting a finite endpoint to infinity. We show that the latter property is equivalent to the function being criniferous (a necessary condition for having a Cantor bouquet Julia set). On the other hand, we show that there is a criniferous disjoint-type entire function whose Julia set is not a Cantor bouquet. We also provide a new characterisation of Cantor bouquet Julia sets in terms of the existence of certain absorbing sets for the set of escaping points, and use this to give a new intrinsic description of a class of entire functions previously introduced by the first author. Finally, the main known sufficient condition for Cantor bouquet Julia sets is the so-called head-start condition of Rottenfusser et al. Under a mild geometric assumption, we prove that this condition is also necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isospectral reduction is an important tool for network/matrix analysis as it reduces the dimension of a matrix/network while preserving its eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The main contribution of this manuscript is a proposed algorithmic scheme to approximate the stationary measure of a stochastic matrix based on isospectral reductions. We run numerical experiments that indicate this scheme is advantageous when there is more than one eigenvalue near 1, precisely the case where iterative methods perform poorly. We give a partial explanation why this scheme should work well, showing that in some situations isospectral reduction improves the spectral gap.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with undecidable domino problem, such as $\mathbb{Z}^2$. We prove that all nontrivial dynamical properties for sofic $G$-subshifts are undecidable, that this is not true for $G$-SFTs, and an undecidability result for dynamical properties of $G$-SFTs similar to the Adian-Rabin theorem. Furthermore we prove a Rice-like result for dynamical invariants asserting that every computable real-valued invariant for $G$-SFTs that is monotone by disjoint unions and products is constant.</description>

Abstract: We study the ergodic properties (recurrence, discrepancy, diffusion coefficients and ergodicity itself) of a class of $\mathbb Z$-extensions over infinite interval exchange transformations called rotated odometers. The choice of a skew-function is motivated by the use in the study of parallel flows on a particular staircase manifold of infinite genus.</description>

      <title>Classification of abelian actions with globally hypoelliptic orbitwise laplacian I: The Greenfield-Wallach conjecture on nilmanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a $\mathbb{R}^{k}-$action generated by vector fields $X_{1},...,X_{k}$ we define an operator $-(X_{1}^{2}+...+X_{k}^{2})$, the orbitwise laplacian. In this paper, we study and classify $\mathbb{R}^{k}-$actions whose orbitwise laplacian is globally hypoelliptic (GH). In three different settings we prove that any such action is given by a translation action on some compact nilmanifold, (i) when the space is a compact nilmanifold, (ii) when the first Betti number of the manifold is sufficiently large, (iii) when the codimension of the orbitfoliation of the action is $1$. As a consequence, we prove the Greenfield-Wallach conjecture on all nilmanifolds. Along the way, we also calculate the cohomology of GH $\mathbb{R}^{k}-$actions, proving, in particular, that it is always finite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Improved Gevrey-1 estimates of formal series expansions of center manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the coefficients $\phi_n$ of the formal series expansions $y=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \phi_n x^n\in x\mathbb C[[x]]$ of center manifolds of planar analytic saddle-nodes grow like $\Gamma(n+a)$ (after rescaling $x$) as $n\rightarrow \infty$. Here the quantity $a$ is the formal analytic invariant associated with the saddle node (following the work of J. Martinet and J.-P. Ramis). This growth property of $\phi_n$, which cannot be improved when the center manifold is nonanalytic, was recently (2024) described for a restricted class of nonlinearities by the present author in collaboration with P. Szmolyan. This joint work was in turn inspired by the work of Merle, Rapha\"{e}l, Rodnianski, and Szeftel (2022), which described the growth of the coefficients for a system related to self-similar solutions of the compressible Euler. In the present paper, we combine the previous approaches with a Borel-Laplace approach. Specifically, we adapt the Banach norm of Bonckaert and De Maesschalck (2008) in order to capture the singularity in the complex plane.</description>

Abstract: This work highlights a peculiar phenomenon of interval exchange. Considering a real number beta less than -1, the negative beta-shift is coded if and only if its absolute value is greater than the golden ratio. We study an increasing sequence of algebraic integers with limit-1 and the absolute value of the first term equals to the golden ratio such that for a base x taken in the interval of consicutive terms of this sequence, the measure of the maximal entropy is carried by the image of a beta-shift, with the golden ratio les than the absolute value of beta, under the mapping of an injective substitution.</description>

      <title>Tree-like graphings, wallings, and median graphings of equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13010v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results showing that every locally finite Borel graph whose large-scale geometry is "tree-like" induces a treeable equivalence relation. In particular, our hypotheses hold if each component of the original graph either has bounded tree-width or is quasi-isometric to a tree, answering a question of Tucker-Drob. In the latter case, we moreover show that there exists a Borel quasi-isometry to a Borel forest, under the additional assumption of (componentwise) bounded degree. We also extend these results on quasi-treeings to Borel proper metric spaces. In fact, our most general result shows treeability of countable Borel equivalence relations equipped with an abstract wallspace structure on each class obeying some local finiteness conditions, which we call a proper walling. The proof is based on the Stone duality between proper wallings and median graphs, i.e., CAT(0) cube complexes. Finally, we strengthen the conclusion of treeability in these results to hyperfiniteness in the case where the original graph has one (selected) end per component, generalizing the same result for trees due to Dougherty--Jackson--Kechris.</description>

      <title>Supersonic Gravitational Collapse for Non-Isentropic Gaseous Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of a new class of initially smooth spherically symmetric self-similar solutions to the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system. These solutions exhibit supersonic gravitational implosion in the sense that the density blows-up in finite time while the fluid velocity remains supersonic. In particular, they occupy a portion of the phase space that is far from the recently constructed isentropic self-similar implosion. At the heart of our proof is the presence of a two-parameter scaling invariance and the reduction of the problem to a non-autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. We use the requirement of smoothness of the flow as a selection principle that constrains the choice of scaling indices. An important consequence of our analysis is that for all the solutions we construct, the polytropic index $\gamma$ is strictly bigger than $\frac{4}{3}$, which is in sharp contrast to the known results in the isentropic case.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Nonlinear Path-following Guidance with Bounded Input Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tracking of arbitrary curvilinear geometric paths in three-dimensional output spaces of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without pre-specified timing requirements, commonly referred to as path-following problems, subjected to bounded inputs. Specifically, we propose a novel nonlinear path-following guidance law for a UAV that enables it to follow any smooth curvilinear path in three dimensions while accounting for the bounded control authority in the design. The proposed solution offers a general treatment of the path-following problem by removing the dependency on the path's geometry, which makes it applicable to paths with varying levels of complexity and smooth curvatures. Additionally, the proposed strategy draws inspiration from the pursuit guidance approach, which is known for its simplicity and ease of implementation. Theoretical analysis guarantees that the UAV converges to its desired path within a fixed time and remains on it irrespective of its initial configuration with respect to the path. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the merits and effectiveness of the proposed guidance strategy through a wide range of engagement scenarios, showcasing the UAV's ability to follow diverse curvilinear paths accurately.</description>

      <title>An efficient scheme for approximating long-time dynamics of a class of non-linear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, highly efficient, second-order accurate, long-time unconditionally stable numerical scheme for a class of finite-dimensional nonlinear models important in geophysical fluid dynamics. The scheme is highly efficient in that only a fixed symmetric positive definite linear problem (with varying right-hand sides) is solved at each time step. The solutions remain uniformly bounded for all time. We show that the scheme accurately captures the long-time dynamics of the underlying geophysical model, with the global attractors and invariant measures of the scheme converging to those of the original model as the step size approaches zero.
  In our numerical experiments, we adopt an indirect approach, using statistics from long-time simulations to approximate the invariant measures. Our results suggest that the convergence rate of the long-term statistics, as a function of terminal time, is approximately first-order under the Jensen-Shannon metric and half-order under the L^1 metric. This implies that extremely long simulations are required to achieve high-precision approximations of the invariant measure (or climate). Nevertheless, the second-order scheme significantly outperforms its first-order counterpart, requiring far less time to reach a small neighborhood of statistical equilibrium for a given step size.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry in ring lattice systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. By varying the electrical coupling strength between the neurons, we also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across different regimes of the ring lattice system. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.</description>
