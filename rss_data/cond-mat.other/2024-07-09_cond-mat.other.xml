      <title>Thermalization in Trapped Bosonic Systems With Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed study of thermalization is conducted on experimentally accessible states in a system of bosonic atoms trapped in an open linear chain with disorder. When the disorder parameter is large, the system exhibits regularity and localization. In contrast, weak disorder introduces chaos and raises questions about the validity of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), especially for states at the extremes of the energy spectrum which remain regular and non-thermalizing. The validity of ETH is assessed by examining the dispersion of entanglement entropy and the number of bosons on the first site across various dimensions, while maintaining a constant particle density of one. Experimentally accessible states in the occupation basis are categorized using a crowding parameter that linearly correlates with their mean energy. Using full exact diagonalization to simulate temporal evolution, we study the equilibration of entanglement entropy, the number of bosons, and the reduced density matrix of the first site for all states in the occupation basis. Comparing equilibrium values of these observables with those predicted by microcanonical ensembles, we find that, within certain tolerances, most states in the chaotic region thermalize. However, states with low participation ratios in the energy eigenstate basis show greater deviations from thermal equilibrium values.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Wave Nonlinear Polarization Control and Signatures of Criticality in a Perovskite Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising photonic materials for fundamental physics studies and technological applications. Their potential for nonlinear optics has also drawn great interest recently; yet, to date, continuous-wave (CW) nonlinearities have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate CW nonlinear phenomena in a CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite cavity. We first demonstrate optical bistability -- the hallmark of single-mode coherent nonlinear optics. Next we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate nonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the optical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a dramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is indicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$ cavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW nonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable. In addition, our approach to uncover a phase transition of matter via optical hysteresis measurements is promising for exploring strongly correlated states of light-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Optical reflection signature of an axion dielectric with magnetic current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the reflection properties on the interface between an ordinary dielectric medium and a dielectric supporting a magnetic current (equivalent to a dielectric governed by axion electrodynamics). Considering the usual Maxwell equations and constitutive relations, we derive the general Fresnel coefficients for reflection for an incident wave with $s$ and $p$ polarization, assuming an isotropic magnetic current on a dielectric substrate. We determine all total internal reflection and critical angles (Brewster angles) conditions, which are given by strict relations between all relevant electromagnetic quantities of the system and the frequency. For $s$- and $p$-polarized incident waves, total internal reflection can occur under certain conditions on the constitutive parameters (for each propagating mode) at specific frequency windows and certain incidence angle intervals. All possible conditions to define critical angles for null reflection are determined. This scenario allows polarization changes by reflection. Considering a $p$-polarized incident wave, the frequency and the Brewster angle, allowing null reflection for both propagating modes, are determined. The Goos-H\"anchen shift and the complex Kerr rotation are also evaluated. The Kerr ellipticity angle presents a frequency-dependent behavior, also reported in Weyl semimetals, having maximum values $\eta_{Kerr}=\pm \pi/4$ for specific values of frequency, which may work as a signature of this axion chiral dielectric.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method: extended resolution of unity method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method is based on generating a transform between the pseudo wavefunction and all electron wavefunction. For the accuracy of the method, it is important that the local part of the transform (in each atomic sphere $\mathbf{R}$) be over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work without modifying the transformation in any way by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more wavefunctions and having them transform via the identity.</description>

      <title>The influence of the phase and structural state on the low-temperature elastic properties of molybdenum-alloyed non-equiatomic high-entropy alloys of the Fe-Co-Ni-Cr system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical properties and microstructural evolution of a medium-entropy alloy Co$_{17.5}$Cr$_{12.5}$Fe$_{55}$Ni$_{10}$Mo$_{5}$ (at%) in a low temperature range (including the record low temperatures region down to 0.5 K) were investigated. It has been established that low-temperature plastic deformation initiates martensitic phase transformations in this alloy, and the values of the dynamic modulus of elasticity correlate with the degree of phase transformations.</description>
