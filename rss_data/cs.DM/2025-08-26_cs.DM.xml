      <title>Toward Vu's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2002, Vu conjectured that graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum codegree at most $\zeta \Delta$ have chromatic number at most $(\zeta+o(1))\Delta$. Despite its importance, the conjecture has remained widely open. The only direct progress so far has been obtained in the ``dense regime,'' when $\zeta$ is close to $1$, by Hurley, de Verclos, and Kang.
  In this paper we provide the first progress in the sparse regime $\zeta \ll 1$, the case of primary interest to Vu. We show that there exists $\zeta_0 &gt; 0$ such that for all $\zeta \in [\log^{-32}\Delta,\zeta_0]$, the following holds: if $G$ is a graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ and maximum codegree at most $\zeta \Delta$, then $\chi(G) \leq (\zeta^{1/32} + o(1))\Delta$. We derive this from a more general result that assumes only that the common neighborhood of any $s$ vertices is bounded rather than the codegrees of pairs of vertices. Our more general result also extends to the list coloring setting, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Singular Values Versus Expansion in Directed and Undirected Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the nontrivial singular values $\sigma_2,\ldots,\sigma_n$ of the normalized adjacency matrix of an Eulerian directed graph to combinatorial measures of graph expansion: \\ 1. We introduce a new directed analogue of conductance $\phi_{dir}$, and prove a Cheeger-like inequality showing that $\phi_{dir}$ is bounded away from 0 iff $\sigma_2$ is bounded away from 1. In undirected graphs, this can be viewed as a unification of the standard Cheeger Inequality and Trevisan's Cheeger Inequality for the smallest eigenvalue.\\ 2. We prove a singular-value analogue of the Higher-Order Cheeger Inequalities, giving a combinatorial characterization of when $\sigma_k$ is bounded away from 1. \\ 3. We tighten the relationship between $\sigma_2$ and vertex expansion, proving that if a $d$-regular graph $G$ with the property that all sets $S$ of size at most $n/2$ have at least $(1+\delta)\cdot |S|$ out-neighbors, then $1-\sigma_2=\Omega(\delta^2/d)$. This bound is tight and saves a factor of $d$ over the previously known relationship.</description>

      <title>On the Parameterized Complexity of Grundy Domination and Zero Forcing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two different problem families that deal with domination in graphs. On the one hand, we focus on dominating sequences. In such a sequence, every vertex dominates some vertex of the graph that was not dominated by any earlier vertex in the sequence. The problem of finding the longest dominating sequence is known as $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$. Depending on whether the closed or the open neighborhoods are used for domination, there are three other versions of this problem. We show that all four problem variants are $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard when parameterized by the solution size. On the other hand, we consider the family of Zero forcing problems which form the parameterized duals of the Grundy domination problems. In these problems, one looks for the smallest set of vertices initially colored blue such that certain color change rules are able to color all other vertices blue. Bhyravarapu et al. [IWOCA 2025] showed that one of these problems, known as $\mathsf{Zero~Forcing~Set}$, is in $\mathsf{FPT}$ when parameterized by the treewidth or the solution size. We extend their treewidth result to the other three variants of zero forcing and their respective Grundy domination problems. Our algorithm also implies an $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithm for $\mathsf{Grundy~Domination}$ when parameterized by the number of vertices that are not in the dominating sequence.</description>

      <title>Structure and growth of $\mathbb{R}$-bonacci words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A binary word is called $q$-decreasing, for $q&gt;0$, if inside this word each of length-maximal (in the local sense) occurrences of a factor of the form $0^a1^b$, $a&gt;0$, satisfies $q \cdot a &gt; b$. We bijectively link $q$-decreasing words with certain prefixes of the cutting sequence of the line $y=qx$. We show that for any real positive $q$ the number of $q$-decreasing words of length $n$ grows as $C_q \cdot \Phi(q)^n$ for some constant $C_q$ which depends on $q$ but not on $n$. From previous works, it is already known that $\Phi(1)$ is the golden ratio, $\Phi(2)$ is equal to the tribonacci constant, $\Phi(k)$ is $(k+1)$-bonacci constant. We prove that the function $\Phi(q)$ is strictly increasing, discontinuous at every positive rational point, and exhibits a fractal structure related to the Stern-Brocot tree and Minkowski's question mark function.</description>

      <title>A Tie-breaking based Local Search Algorithm for Stable Matching Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stable marriage problem with incomplete lists and ties (SMTI) and the hospitals/residents problem with ties (HRT) are important in matching theory with broad practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a tie-breaking based local search (TBLS) algorithm designed to achieve a weakly stable matching of maximum size for both the SMTI and HRT problems. TBLS begins by arbitrarily resolving all ties and iteratively refines the tie-breaking strategy by adjusting the relative order within ties based on preference ranks and the current stable matching. Additionally, we introduce TBLS-E, an equity-focused variant of TBLS, specifically designed for the SMTI problem. This variant maintains the objective of maximizing matching size, while enhancing equity through two simple modifications. In comparison with ten other approximation and local search algorithms, TBLS achieves the highest matching size, while TBLS-E exhibits the lowest sex equality cost. Significantly, TBLS-E preserves a matching size comparable to that of TBLS. Both our algorithms demonstrate faster computational speed than other local search algorithms in solving large-scale instances. Moreover, our scalability analysis shows that both algorithms maintain efficient performance as problem size increases.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors of regular graphs via entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.</description>
