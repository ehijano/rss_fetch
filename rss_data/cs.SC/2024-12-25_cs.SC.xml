      <title>NoSQL Graph Databases: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are the most suitable structures for modeling objects and interactions in applications where component inter-connectivity is a key feature. There has been increased interest in graphs to represent domains such as social networks, web site link structures, and biology. Graph stores recently rose to prominence along the NoSQL movement. In this work we will focus on NOSQL graph databases, describing their peculiarities that sets them apart from other data storage and management solutions, and how they differ among themselves. We will also analyze in-depth two different graph database management systems - AllegroGraph and Neo4j that uses the most popular graph models used by NoSQL stores in practice: the resource description framework (RDF) and the labeled property graph (LPG), respectively.</description>

      <title>An Optimized Path Planning of Manipulator Using Spline Curves and Real Quantifier Elimination Based on Comprehensive Gr\"obner Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an advanced method for addressing the inverse kinematics and optimal path planning challenges in robot manipulators. The inverse kinematics problem involves determining the joint angles for a given position and orientation of the end-effector. Furthermore, the path planning problem seeks a trajectory between two points. Traditional approaches in computer algebra have utilized Gr\"obner basis computations to solve these problems, offering a global solution but at a high computational cost. To overcome the issue, the present authors have proposed a novel approach that employs the Comprehensive Gr\"obner System (CGS) and CGS-based quantifier elimination (CGS-QE) methods to efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem and certify the existence of solutions for trajectory planning. This paper extends these methods by incorporating smooth curves via cubic spline interpolation for path planning and optimizing joint configurations using shortest path algorithms to minimize the sum of joint configurations along a trajectory. This approach significantly enhances the manipulator's ability to navigate complex paths and optimize movement sequences.</description>
