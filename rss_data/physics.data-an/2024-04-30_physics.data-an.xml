      <title>Two-Dimensional (2D) Hybrid Method: Expanding 2D Correlation Spectroscopy (2D-COS) for Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a concise report on the '2DHybrid' method, an innovative extension of two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D COS), tailored for quasar light curve analysis. Addressing the challenge of discerning periodic variations against the background of intrinsic "red" noise fluctuations, this method employs cross-correlation of wavelet transform matrices to reveal distinct correlation patterns between underlaying oscillations, offering new insights into quasar dynamics.</description>

      <title>A symbolic information approach applied to human intracranial data to characterize and distinguish different congnitive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How the human brain processes information during different cognitive tasks is one of the greatest questions in contemporary neuroscience. Understanding the statistical properties of brain signals during specific activities is one promising way to address this question. Here we analyze freely available data from implanted electrocorticography (ECoG) in five human subjects during two different cognitive tasks in the light of information theory quantifiers ideas. We employ a symbolic information approach to determine the probability distribution function associated with the time series from different cortical areas. Then we utilize these probabilities to calculate the associated Shannon entropy and a statistical complexity measure based on the disequilibrium between the actual time series and one with a uniform probability distribution function. We show that an Euclidian distance in the complexity-entropy plane and an asymmetry index for complexity are useful for comparing the two conditions. We show that our method can distinguish visual search epochs from blank screen intervals in different electrodes and patients. By using a multi-scale approach and embedding time delays to downsample the data, we find important time scales in which the relevant information is being processed. We also determine cortical regions and time intervals along the 2-second-long trials that present more pronounced differences between the two cognitive tasks. Finally, we show that the method is useful to distinguish cognitive processes using brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis.</description>

      <title>Bridging Worlds: Achieving Language Interoperability between Julia and Python in Scientific Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of scientific computing, both Julia and Python have established themselves as powerful tools. Within the context of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis, Python has been traditionally favored, yet there exists a compelling case for migrating legacy software to Julia. This article focuses on language interoperability, specifically exploring how Awkward Array data structures can bridge the gap between Julia and Python. The talk offers insights into key considerations such as memory management, data buffer copies, and dependency handling. It delves into the performance enhancements achieved by invoking Julia from Python and vice versa, particularly for intensive array-oriented calculations involving large-scale, though not excessively dimensional, arrays of HEP data. The advantages and challenges inherent in achieving interoperability between Julia and Python in the domain of scientific computing are discussed.</description>

      <title>BUFF: Boosted Decision Tree based Ultra-Fast Flow matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data stands out as one of the most frequently encountered types in high energy physics. Unlike commonly homogeneous data such as pixelated images, simulating high-dimensional tabular data and accurately capturing their correlations are often quite challenging, even with the most advanced architectures. Based on the findings that tree-based models surpass the performance of deep learning models for tasks specific to tabular data, we adopt the very recent generative modeling class named conditional flow matching and employ different techniques to integrate the usage of Gradient Boosted Trees. The performances are evaluated for various tasks on different analysis level with several public datasets. We demonstrate the training and inference time of most high-level simulation tasks can achieve speedup by orders of magnitude. The application can be extended to low-level feature simulation and conditioned generations with competitive performance.</description>
