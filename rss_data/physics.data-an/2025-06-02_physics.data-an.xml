      <title>The Use of Alendronate to Enhance Transcranial Transmission of Focused Ultrasound for Successful Ablations in Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of alendronate therapy in improving bone density distribution in skull bones and corresponding ultrasound permeability in patients who had previously experienced unsuccessful transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) ablation. The ability of alendronate treatment to modify skull bone characteristics and enhance the success rate of repeat MRgFUS procedures was assessed.
  Methods: Five patients with initially unsuccessful MRgFUS ablations underwent a 6-12 month regimen of alendronate to improve bone density. Repeat MRgFUS procedures were performed, and changes in skull density ratio (SDR) and peak focal temperatures were evaluated statistically using CT and MR imaging. Histograms of skull bone density were introduced and analysed as an additional metric.
  Results: After therapy, SDR increased in four out of five patients (from 0.378$\pm$0.037 to 0.424$\pm$0.045, p&gt;0.05). All repeated procedures were successful. The maximum focal temperature, averaged over sonications, increased from 53.6$\pm$4.0{\deg}C to 55.7$\pm$4.1{\deg}C (p=0.018), while the maximum temperature per patient rose from 57.0$\pm$2.4{\deg}C to 60.2$\pm$1.8{\deg}C (p=0.031). Histograms of CT scans showed a reduction in low-density voxels, indicating trabecular bone densification. 3D CT scan registration revealed local density changes, defect filling, and void reduction.
  Conclusions: Alendronate therapy enhanced skull bone density distribution and thus ultrasound permeability, which has facilitated successful repeat MRgFUS. By visually analysing CT changes, healthcare professionals can better inform their decision-making regarding repeat surgeries. This method broadens the pool of patients with low SDR eligible for MRgFUS treatment and underscores the potential benefits of alendronate in improving treatment outcomes.</description>

      <title>Closed-form survival probabilities for biased random walks at arbitrary step number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a closed-form expression for the survival probability of a biased random walker to first reach a target site on a 1D lattice. The expression holds for any step number $N$ and is computationally faster than non-closed-form results in the literature. Because our result is exact even in the intermediate step number range, it serves as a tool to study convergence to the large $N$ limit. We also obtain a closed-form expression for the probability of last passage. In contrast to predictions of the large $N$ approximation, the new expression reveals a critical value of the bias beyond which the tail of the last-passage probability decays monotonically.</description>

      <title>Deep Bayesian Filter for Bayes-faithful Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State estimation for nonlinear state space models (SSMs) is a challenging task. Existing assimilation methodologies predominantly assume Gaussian posteriors on physical space, where true posteriors become inevitably non-Gaussian. We propose Deep Bayesian Filtering (DBF) for data assimilation on nonlinear SSMs. DBF constructs new latent variables $h_t$ in addition to the original physical variables $z_t$ and assimilates observations $o_t$. By (i) constraining the state transition on the new latent space to be linear and (ii) learning a Gaussian inverse observation operator $r(h_t|o_t)$, posteriors remain Gaussian. Notably, the structured design of test distributions enables an analytical formula for the recursive computation, eliminating the accumulation of Monte Carlo sampling errors across time steps. DBF trains the Gaussian inverse observation operators $r(h_t|o_t)$ and other latent SSM parameters (e.g., dynamics matrix) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. Experiments demonstrate that DBF outperforms model-based approaches and latent assimilation methods in tasks where the true posterior distribution on physical space is significantly non-Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a New Star Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of known star clusters, associations, and moving groups in the vicinity of the Sun has increased significantly due to the use of Gaia data. We investigated the existence and properties of open superclusters (OSC) within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Using advanced Gaia-derived astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze member stars of various clusters, deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered cluster Duvia~1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of highly populated primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pretrain the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode. We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>
