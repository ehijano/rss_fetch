      <title>TumorTwin: A python framework for patient-specific digital twins in oncology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Advances in the theory and methods of computational oncology have enabled accurate characterization and prediction of tumor growth and treatment response on a patient-specific basis. This capability can be integrated into a digital twin framework in which bi-directional data-flow between the physical tumor and the digital tumor facilitate dynamic model re-calibration, uncertainty quantification, and clinical decision-support via recommendation of optimal therapeutic interventions. However, many digital twin frameworks rely on bespoke implementations tailored to each disease site, modeling choice, and algorithmic implementation.
  Findings: We present TumorTwin, a modular software framework for initializing, updating, and leveraging patient-specific cancer tumor digital twins. TumorTwin is publicly available as a Python package, with associated documentation, datasets, and tutorials. Novel contributions include the development of a patient-data structure adaptable to different disease sites, a modular architecture to enable the composition of different data, model, solver, and optimization objects, and CPU- or GPU-parallelized implementations of forward model solves and gradient computations. We demonstrate the functionality of TumorTwin via an in silico dataset of high-grade glioma growth and response to radiation therapy.
  Conclusions: The TumorTwin framework enables rapid prototyping and testing of image-guided oncology digital twins. This allows researchers to systematically investigate different models, algorithms, disease sites, or treatment decisions while leveraging robust numerical and computational infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Assisted Outer Volume Removal for Highly-Accelerated Real-Time Dynamic MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time (RT) dynamic MRI plays a vital role in capturing rapid physiological processes, offering unique insights into organ motion and function. Among these applications, RT cine MRI is particularly important for functional assessment of the heart with high temporal resolution. RT imaging enables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial alternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold, ECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine MRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues, particularly at high undersampling factors. In this study, we propose a novel outer volume removal (OVR) method to address this challenge by eliminating aliasing contributions from non-cardiac regions in a post-processing framework. Our approach estimates the outer volume signal for each timeframe using composite temporal images from time-interleaved undersampling patterns, which inherently contain pseudo-periodic ghosting artifacts. A deep learning (DL) model is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean outer volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding k-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL (PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high spatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed method at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable to clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for artifact reduction in RT cine MRI without requiring acquisition modifications, offering a pathway to higher acceleration rates while preserving diagnostic quality.</description>
