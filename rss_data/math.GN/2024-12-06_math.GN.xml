      <title>Remetrizing dynamical systems to control distances of points in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main aim of this article is to prove that for any continuous function $f \colon X \to X$, where $X$ is metrizable (or, more generally, for any family $\mathcal{F}$ of such functions, satisfying an additional condition), there exists a compatible metric $d$ on $X$ such that the $n$th iteration of $f$ (more generally, the composition of any $n$ functions from $\mathcal{F}$) is Lipschitz with constant $a_k$ where $(a_k)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ is an arbitrarily fixed sequence of real numbers such that $1 &lt; a_k$ and $\lim\limits_{k\to+\infty}a_k = +\infty$. In particular, any dynamical system can be remetrized in order to significantly control the distance between points by their initial distance.</description>

      <title>An Excursion with Divergence Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we compare and contrast various selective divergence properties such as the properties of being discretely selective and selectively highly divergent. We identify and incorporate a class of subsemigroups of the semigroup of strictly increasing maps from the naturals to themselves. We investigate certain implications for hyperspaces of finite subsets and characterize the closed discrete selection game on a space in terms of a particular selection game on the Vietoris hyperspace of finite subsets of that space. We also isolate some sufficient conditions on a space that guarantee that the corresponding Pixley-Roy hyperspace of finite subsets is discretely selective. We end by noting that the properties of being discretely selective and of being selectively highly divergent are equivalent in rings of continuous functions with standard topologies of uniform convergence.</description>

      <title>Enveloping Ellis semigroups as compactifications of transformations groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a proper Ellis semigroup compactification is introduced. Ellis's functional approach shows how to obtain them from totally bounded equiuniformities on a phase space $X$ when the acting group $G$ is with the topology of pointwise convergence and the $G$-space $(G, X, \curvearrowright)$ is $G$-Tychonoff.
  The correspondence between proper Ellis semigroup compactifications of a topological group and special totally bounded equiuniformities (called Ellis equiuniformities) on a topological group is established. The Ellis equiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal equiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly equicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\,(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\,(X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is shown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Arrangements of small circles for Morse-Bott functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a topic of mathematics, "arrangements", systems of hyperplanes, circles, and general (regular) submanifolds, attract us strongly. We present a natural elementary study of arrangements of circles. It is also a kind of new studies. Our study is closely related to geometry and singularity theory of Morse(-Bott) functions. Regions surrounded by circles are regarded as images of real algebraic maps and composing them with projections gives Morse-Bott functions: this observation is natural, and surprisingly, recently presented first, by the author. We present a new way of their construction.
  We present a systematic way of constructing such arrangements by choosing small circles centered at existing circles inductively. We are interested in graphs the regions surrounded by the circles naturally collapse. They are essentially so-called Reeb graphs of the previous Morse-Bott functions: they are spaces of all components of preimages of single points for the functions.</description>

      <title>Gruenhage spaces and their influence on Banach space renorming theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a paper from 1987, Gruenhage defined a class of topological spaces that now bear his name, and used it to solve a problem of Talagrand on the existence of dense $G_\delta$ metrizable subsets of Gul'ko compact spaces. Gruenhage's paper became highly influential among researchers in renorming theory, a branch of Banach space theory. In this paper we survey Gruenhage and related spaces, and their interactions with renorming theory.</description>

      <title>Constructing Compacta from Posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a simple method of constructing topological spaces from countable posets with finite levels, one which applies to all second countable T_1 compacta. This results in a duality amenable to building such spaces from finite building blocks, essentially an abstract analog of classical constructions defining compacta from progressively finer open covers.</description>
