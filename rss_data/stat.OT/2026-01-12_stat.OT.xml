      <title>How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.</description>

      <title>MajinBook: An open catalogue of digital world literature with likes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This data paper introduces MajinBook, an open catalogue designed to facilitate the use of shadow libraries--such as Library Genesis and Z-Library--for computational social science and cultural analytics. By linking metadata from these vast, crowd-sourced archives with structured bibliographic data from Goodreads, we create a high-precision corpus of over 539,000 references to English-language books spanning three centuries, enriched with first publication dates, genres, and popularity metrics like ratings and reviews. Our methodology prioritizes natively digital EPUB files to ensure machine-readable quality, while addressing biases in traditional corpora like HathiTrust, and includes secondary datasets for French, German, and Spanish. We evaluate the linkage strategy for accuracy, release all underlying data openly, and discuss the project's legal permissibility under EU and US frameworks for text and data mining in research.</description>
