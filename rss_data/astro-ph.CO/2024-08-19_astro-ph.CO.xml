      <title>What if the universe expands linearly? A local general relativity to solve the "zero active mass" problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern cosmology presents important challenges such as the \textit{Hubble tension}, \textit{El Gordo's collision} or the \textit{impossible galaxies} ($z &gt; 10$). Slight modifications to the standard model propose new parameters (e.g. the early and dynamical dark energy). On the other hand, alternatives such as the coasting universes (e.g. the \textit{hyperconical model} and the spatially flat $R_h = ct$ universe) are statistically compatible with most of observational tests, but still present theoretical problems in matching the observed matter contents since they predict a ``zero active gravitational mass.'' To solve these open issues, we suggest that general relativity might be not valid at cosmic scales, but it would be valid at local scales. This proposal is addressed from two main features of the embedding hyperconical model: 1) the background metric would be independent of the matter content, and 2) the observed cosmic acceleration would be fictitious and because of a distorted stereographic projection of coordinates that produce an apparent radial inhomogeneity from homogeneous manifolds. Finally, to support the discussion, standard observational tests were updated here, showing that the hyperconical model is adequately fitted to Type Ia Supernovae, quasars, galaxy clusters, BAO, and cosmic chronometer data sets.</description>

      <title>On the correlation between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and galaxy density in late reionization models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity and local galaxy density (the opacity-density relation) is a key observational test of late reionization models. Using narrow-band surveys of z=5.7 Ly$\alpha$ emitters centered on quasar sight lines, Christenson et al. (2023) showed that two of the most transmissive forest segments at this redshift intersect galaxy underdensities. This is in tension with models of a strongly fluctuating ionizing background, including some late reionization models, which predict that the vast majority of these segments should intersect overdensities where the ionizing intensity is strongest. We use radiative transfer simulations to explore in detail the opacity-density relation in late reionization models. Fields like the one toward quasar PSO J359-06 -- the more underdense of the two transmissive sight lines in Christenson et al. (2023) -- typically contain recently reionized gas in cosmic voids where the hot temperatures and low densities enhance Ly$\alpha$ transmission. The opacity-density relation's transmissive end is sensitive to the amount of neutral gas in voids, and its morphology, set by the reionization source clustering. These effects are, however, degenerate. We demonstrate that models with very different source clustering can yield similar opacity-density relations when their reionization histories are calibrated to match Ly$\alpha$ forest mean flux measurements at z&lt;6. In models with fixed source clustering, a lower neutral fraction increases the likelihood of intersecting hot, recently reionized gas in voids, increasing the likelihood of observing PSO J359-06. For instance, the probability of observing this field is 15% in a model with neutral fraction $x_{\rm HI}=5\%$ at z=5.7, three times more likely than in a model with $x_{\rm HI}=15\%$. The opacity-density relation may thus provide a complementary probe of reionization's end.</description>

      <title>Dark matter cooling during early matter-domination boosts sub-earth halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of an early matter-dominated epoch prior to the big bang nucleosynthesis may lead to a scenario where the thermal dark matter cools faster than plasma before the radiation dominated era begins. In the radiation-dominated epoch, dark matter free-streams after it decouples both chemically and kinetically from the plasma. In the presence of an early matter-dominated era, chemical decoupling of the dark matter may succeed by a partial kinetic decoupling before reheating ends, depending upon the contributions of different partial wave amplitudes in the elastic scattering rate of the dark matter. We show that the s-wave scattering is sufficient to partially decouple the dark matter from the plasma, if the entropy injection during the reheating era depends on the bath temperature, while p-wave scattering leads to full decoupling in such cosmological backdrop. The decoupling of dark matter before the end of reheating causes an additional amount of cooling, reducing its free-streaming horizon compared to usual radiation-dominated cosmology. The enhanced matter perturbations for scales entering the horizon prior to the end of reheating, combined with the reduced free-steaming horizon, increase the number density of sub-earth mass halos. Resulting boost in the dark matter annihilation signatures could offer an intriguing probe to differentiate pre-BBN non-standard cosmological epochs. We show that the free-streaming horizon of the dark matter requires to be smaller than a cut-off to ensure boost in the sub-earth halo populations. As case studies we present two examples: one for a scalar dark matter with s-wave elastic scattering and the other one featuring a fermionic dark matter with p-wave elastic scattering. We identify regions of parameter space in both models where the dark matter kinetically decouples during reheating, amplifying small scale structure formation.</description>

      <title>On the full non-Gaussian Surprise statistic and the cosmological concordance between DESI, SDSS and Pantheon+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing precision of recent cosmological surveys and the discovery of important tensions within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, it is becoming more and more important to develop tools to quantify accurately the discordance between different probes. One such tool is the Surprise statistic, a measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The Surprise, however, has been up to now applied only under its Gaussian approximation, which can fail to properly capture discordance in cases that deviate significantly from Gaussianity. In this paper we developed the klsurprise code which computes the full numerical non-Gaussian Surprise, and analyse the Surprise for BAO + BBN and supernova data. We test different cosmological models, some of which the parameters deviate significantly from Gaussianity. We find that the non-Gaussianities, mainly present in the Supernova dataset, change the Surprise statistic significantly from its Gaussian approximation, and reveal a $2.7\sigma$ tension in the curved $w$CDM model (o$w$CDM) between the combined Pantheon+ and SH0ES (Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES) data and the dataset which combines SDSS, BOSS and eBOSS BAO. This tension is hidden in the Gaussian Surprise approximation. For DESI the tension with Pantheon+ &amp; SH0ES is at the meager $1.9\sigma$ level for o$w$CDM, but a large $3.3\sigma$ for $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Prediction of the Void and Galaxy Clustering Measurements in the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The void power spectrum is related to the clustering of low-density regions in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, and can be used as an effective cosmological probe to extract the information of the LSS. We generate the galaxy mock catalogs from Jiutian simulation, and identify voids using the watershed algorithm for studying the cosmological constraint strength of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic survey. The galaxy and void auto power spectra and void-galaxy cross power spectra at $z=0.3$, 0.6, and 0.9 are derived from the mock catalogs. To fit the full power spectra, we propose to use the void average effective radius at a given redshift to simplify the theoretical model, and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. The systematical parameters, such as galaxy and void biases, and noise terms in the power spectra are also included in the fitting process. We find that our theoretical model can correctly extract the cosmological information from the galaxy and void power spectra, which demonstrates its feasibility and effectivity. The joint constraint accuracy of the cosmological parameters can be improved by $\sim20\%$ compared to that from the galaxy power spectrum only. The fitting results of the void density profile and systematical parameters are also well constrained and consistent with the expectation. This indicates that the void clustering measurement can be an effective complement to the galaxy clustering probe, especially for the next generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Breaking the cosmological invariance of the dark matter halos shape as a new probe of modified gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics, Alimi &amp; Koskas (2024) have highlighted in wCDM models derived from general relativity (with Dark Energy Universe numerical simulation data), a cosmological invariance of the distribution of dark matter (DM) halo shapes when expressed in terms of the non-linear fluctuations of the cosmic matter field. We show in this paper that this invariance persists when tested on numerical simulations performed with a different code, i.e. a different N-body solver, DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulation (Giocoli et al. 2018) and that it is also robust to the addition of neutrinos to the cold component of dark matter. However, this discovery raises crucial questions about the validity of this invariance in modified gravity models. Thus, we examine whether the invariance observed by Alimi &amp; Koskas (2024) remains robust in the case of Hu &amp; Sawicki models of modified gravity using numerical simulations performed by Giocoli et al. (2018). By comparing the results of advanced numerical simulations in these different theoretical frameworks, we found significant deviations from the invariance observed in the framework of wCDM models of GR. These deviations suggest that the nature of the gravitation significantly influences the shape of the DM halos. We then interpret this deviation observed in the modified gravity models from the GR models as due to the scalar-field screening effect corresponding to such f(R)-type theories. This one modifies the sphericalization process of DM halos during their formation, precisely because the critical mass at which this scalar field becomes non-negligible is the mass at which the deviation appears. To this extent, the deviation from cosmological invariance in the shape of DM halos is a cosmological probe of the nature of gravity, and the mass scale at which it appears can be used to estimate the $f_{R0}$ parameter of such theories.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the outskirts of PSZ2 G096.88+24.18 from depolarization analysis of radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the polarization properties of the double radio relics in PSZ2 G096.88+24.18 using the rotation measure synthesis, and try to constrain the characteristics of the magnetic field that reproduce the observed beam depolarization. Our aim is to understand the nature of the low polarization fraction that characterizes the southern relic with respect to the northern relic. Using new 1-2 GHz VLA observations, we derive the rotation measure and polarization of the two relics by applying the RM synthesis technique, thus solving for bandwidth depolarization in the wide observing bandwidth. To study the effect of beam depolarization, we degraded the image resolution and studied the decreasing trend of polarization fraction with increasing beam size. Finally, we performed 3D magnetic field simulations using multiple models for the magnetic field power spectrum over a wide range of scales, in order to constrain the characteristics of the cluster magnetic field that can reproduce the observed beam depolarization trend. Using RM synthesis, we obtained a polarization fraction of ($18.6 \pm 0.3$)% for the norther relic and ($14.6 \pm 0.1$)% for the southern one. Having corrected for bandwidth depolarization, we infer that the nature of the depolarization for the southern relic is external, and possibly related to the turbulent gas distribution within the cluster, or to the complex spatial structure of the relic. The best-fit magnetic field power spectrum, that reproduces the observed depolarization trend for the southern relic, is obtained for a turbulent magnetic field model, described by a power spectrum derived from cosmological simulations, and defined within the scales of $\Lambda_{\rm{min}}=35~\rm{kpc}$ and $\Lambda_{\rm{max}}=400~\rm{kpc}$. This yields an average magnetic field of the cluster within 1$~\rm{Mpc}^3$ volume of $\sim 2~\rm{\mu G}$.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic universe with anisotropic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic equation of state parameterization of dark energy within the framework of an axisymmetric (planar) Bianchi-I universe. In addition to constraining the equation of state for anisotropic dark energy and other standard cosmological model parameters, we also constrain any underlying anisotropic axis using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae data set augmented by SH0ES Cepheid distance calibrators. The mean anisotropic dark energy equation of state and corresponding difference in the equation of states in and normal to the plane of our axisymmetric Bianchi-I space-time are found to be $\bar{w}=-0.90^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ and $\delta_w=-0.140^{+0.11}_{-0.082}$ respectively. We also find an axis of anisotropy in this planar Bianchi-I model with anisotropic dark energy to be $\approx(279^{\circ} ,12^{\circ})$ in galactic coordinates. Our analysis of different cosmological models suggests that while a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic dark energy (the $w_b$CDM model) shows some preference over other anisotropic models, it is still less likely than the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or a model with a constant dark energy equation of state ($w$CDM). Overall, the $\Lambda$CDM model remains the most probable model based on the Akaike Information Criterion.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <title>Model implementations of axion dark matter from kinetic misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axion kinetic misalignment mechanism (KMM) opens the possibility of explaining dark matter for almost any axion mass and decay constant that are not accessible by the standard misalignment mechanism, in particular at low values of the axion decay constant (i.e. large coupling). This is a new opportunity for most axion experiments which could be sensitive to dark matter and probe new regimes of axion cosmology. We scrutinise UV completions that lead to the KMM mechanism. These mainly rely on the early dynamics of the axion partner, the radial mode of the complex scalar field, from which the axion inherits kinetic energy. The damping of the radial-mode energy density is then a necessary ingredient. We study in detail thermal damping from interactions in the plasma. A minimal and rather natural implementation consists of a KSVZ-type model with a nearly-quadratic potential for the radial mode extended by U(1)-breaking higher-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we study Higgs portal interactions as an alternative damping mechanism and improve upon previously proposed implementations based on quartic potentials. These implementations can lead to the QCD axion being dark matter and in the reach of IAXO, while MADMAX, IAXO and ALPS II can be sensitive to a generic Axion-Like-Particle (ALP) as dark matter. Such models typically feature a kination era. We also show that ALP dark matter from KMM points to a particular realization of inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel candidate for cold dark matter consisting of condensed Cooper pairs in a theory of interacting fermions with broken chiral symmetry. Establishing the thermal history from the early radiation era to the present, the fermions are shown to behave like standard radiation at high temperatures, but then experience a critical era decaying faster than radiation, akin to freeze-out that sets the relic abundance. Through a second-order phase transition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes towards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the non-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the standard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined measurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We also show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is frustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived source of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Parametrically amplified super-radiance towards hot big bang universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of preheating stage after inflation, using a new idea of parametrically amplified super-radiance. Highly coherent state, characterized by macro-coherence of scalar field coupled to produced massless particle in pairs, is created by parametric resonance effects associated with field oscillation around its potential minimum, within a Hubble volume. The state is described effectively by the simple Dicke-type of super-radiance model, and super-radiant pulse is emitted within a Hubble time, justifying neglect of cosmic expansion. Produced particles are shown to interact to change their energy and momentum distribution to realize thermal hot big bang universe. A long standing problem of heating after inflation may thus be solved. A new dark matter candidate produced at the emergence of thermalized universe is suggested as well.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails from Soft Theorem: A Short Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If a set of massive objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, possibly forming black holes, then this process will emit gravitational waves. Computing the detailed gravitational wave-form associated with this process is a complicated problem, not only due to the non-linearity of gravity but also due to the fact that during the collision and subsequent fragmentation the objects could undergo complicated non-gravitational interactions. Nevertheless the classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms of only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference to what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain the results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.</description>

      <title>Apparent parity violation in the observed galaxy trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the 4-point correlation function in large-scale galaxy surveys have found apparent evidence of parity violation in the distribution of galaxies. This cannot happen via dynamical gravitational effects in general relativity. If such a violation arose from physics in the early Universe it could indicate important new physics beyond the standard model, and would be at odds with most models of inflation. It is therefore now timely to consider the galaxy trispectrum in more detail. While the intrinsic 4-point correlation function, or equivalently the trispectrum, its Fourier counterpart, is parity invariant, the observed trispectrum must take redshift-space distortions into account. Although the standard Newtonian correction also respects parity invariance, we show that sub-leading relativistic corrections do not. We demonstrate that these can be significant at intermediate linear scales and are dominant over the Newtonian parity-invariant part around the equality scale and above. Therefore when observing the galaxy 4-point correlation function, we should expect to detect parity violation on large scales.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin Interactions in General Relativity versus Linearized Massive Gravity: $N$-body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulated spin-spin interactions of $N$-bodies in linearized General Relativity (GR) and linearized Massive Gravity of the Fierz-Pauli type (mGR). It was noted earlier that there is a discrete difference between the spin-spin interaction potential in GR and mGR for a $2$-body system, akin to the van Dam-Veltman-Zakharov discontinuity in the static Newton's potential. Specifically, at large distances, GR favors anti-parallel spin orientation with total spin pointing along the interaction axis, while mGR favors parallel spin orientation with total spin perpendicular to the axis between the sources. For an $N$-body system, a simulation in mGR hitherto has not been done and one would like to know the total spin of the system in both theories. Here we remedy this. In the simulations of GR, we observed that the total spin tends to decrease from a random initial configuration, while for mGR with a large distance, the total spin increases.</description>

      <title>Inflection Point of Minimally Coupled Tachyonic Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the behaviour of a minimally coupled tachyonic scalar field at inflection points in an accelerating universe. We consider the different expansion factors and obtain potentials of tachyonic scalar field. Inflection points of homogeneous tachyonic scalar field is calculated for these potentials. We employ the tools of dynamical system analysis for the considered potentials and obtain the stable points.</description>

      <title>Violation of causality in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological solutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is shown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are satisfied, we find that G\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified gravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. As a matter of fact, out of all G\"odel-type metrics only G\"odel's original model is compatible with $f(Q)$ gravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy conditions be obeyed by the matter content leads to mild restrictions on the function $f(Q)$.</description>
