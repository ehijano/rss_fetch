      <title>Enhancing Organizational Performance: Harnessing AI and NLP for User Feedback Analysis in Product Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of AI and NLP techniques for user feedback analysis in the context of heavy machine crane products. By leveraging AI and NLP, organizations can gain insights into customer perceptions, improve product development, enhance satisfaction and loyalty, inform decision-making, and gain a competitive advantage. The paper highlights the impact of user feedback analysis on organizational performance and emphasizes the reasons for using AI and NLP, including scalability, objectivity, improved accuracy, increased insights, and time savings. The methodology involves data collection, cleaning, text and rating analysis, interpretation, and feedback implementation. Results include sentiment analysis, word cloud visualizations, and radar charts comparing product attributes. These findings provide valuable information for understanding customer sentiment, identifying improvement areas, and making data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience. In conclusion, promising AI and NLP techniques in user feedback analysis offer organizations a powerful tool to understand customers, improve product development, increase satisfaction, and drive business success</description>

      <title>Overcoming Anchoring Bias: The Potential of AI and XAI-based Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information systems (IS) are frequently designed to leverage the negative effect of anchoring bias to influence individuals' decision-making (e.g., by manipulating purchase decisions). Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the explanations of its decisions through explainable AI (XAI) have opened new opportunities for mitigating biased decisions. So far, the potential of these technological advances to overcome anchoring bias remains widely unclear. To this end, we conducted two online experiments with a total of N=390 participants in the context of purchase decisions to examine the impact of AI and XAI-based decision support on anchoring bias. Our results show that AI alone and its combination with XAI help to mitigate the negative effect of anchoring bias. Ultimately, our findings have implications for the design of AI and XAI-based decision support and IS to overcome cognitive biases.</description>

      <title>Cultural Diversity and Its Impact on Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hofstede's six cultural dimensions make it possible to measure the culture of countries but are criticized for assuming the homogeneity of each country. In this paper, we propose two measures based on Hofstede's cultural dimensions which take into account the heterogeneous structure of citizens with respect to their countries of origin. Using these improved measures, we study the influence of heterogeneous culture and cultural diversity on the quality of institutions measured by the six worldwide governance indicators. We use a linear regression model allowing for dependence in spatial and temporal dimensions as well as high correlation between the governance indicators. Our results show that the effect of cultural diversity improves some of the governance indicators while worsening others depending on the individual Hofstede cultural dimension.</description>

      <title>Zonal vs. Nodal Pricing: An Analysis of Different Pricing Rules in the German Day-Ahead Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European electricity market is based on large pricing zones with a uniform day-ahead price. The energy transition leads to changes in supply and demand and increasing redispatch costs. In an attempt to ensure efficient market clearing and congestion management, the EU Commission has mandated the Bidding Zone Review (BZR) to reevaluate the configuration of European bidding zones. Based on a unique data set published in the context of the BZR, we compare various pricing rules for the German power market. We compare market clearing and pricing for national, zonal, and nodal models, including their generation costs and associated redispatch costs. Our results indicate that the differences in the average prices in different zones are much smaller and savings in redispatch cost lower compared to earlier studies based on less comprehensive data sets. The total costs across different configurations are similar and the reduction of standard deviations in prices is also small based on this data set. Nodal pricing rules lead to the lowest total cost. We also evaluate differences of nodal pricing rules with respect to the quality of the congestion signals and the necessary uplift payments, which is relevant in the context of the current discussion on non-uniform pricing in the EU. While the study focuses on Germany, the analysis is relevant beyond and feeds into the broader discussion about pricing rules in non-convex markets</description>

      <title>Demand and Welfare Analysis in Discrete Choice Models with Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.04028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many real-life settings of consumer-choice involve social interactions, causing targeted policies to have spillover-effects. This paper develops novel empirical tools for analyzing demand and welfare-effects of policy-interventions in binary choice settings with social interactions. Examples include subsidies for health-product adoption and vouchers for attending a high-achieving school. We establish the connection between econometrics of large games and Brock-Durlauf-type interaction models, under both I.I.D. and spatially correlated unobservables. We develop new convergence results for associated beliefs and estimates of preference-parameters under increasing-domain spatial asymptotics. Next, we show that even with fully parametric specifications and unique equilibrium, choice data, that are sufficient for counterfactual demand-prediction under interactions, are insufficient for welfare-calculations. This is because distinct underlying mechanisms producing the same interaction coefficient can imply different welfare-effects and deadweight-loss from a policy-intervention. Standard index-restrictions imply distribution-free bounds on welfare. We illustrate our results using experimental data on mosquito-net adoption in rural Kenya.</description>
