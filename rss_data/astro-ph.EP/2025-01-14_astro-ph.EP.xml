      <title>Deep radio interferometric search for decametre radio emission from the exoplanet Tau Bo\"otis b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission from exoplanets in the 10-40 MHz radio band is likely the only way to measure an exoplanet's magnetic field directly. However, no definitive detection of exoplanetary ECM emission has been made to date. A detection of the hot Jupiter Tau Bo\"otis b was reported but with an observing mode that is not immune to confusion from off-axis interference, making the detection tentative. We searched for radio emissions from Tau Bo\"otis b using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in interferometric mode, which employs direction-of-arrival information to discriminate genuine signals from interference. Our aim was to confirm the previous tentative detection or establish an upper limit in the case of a non-detection. We conducted observations using LOFAR's Low Band Antenna in interferometric mode, which totalled 64, hours spread over 8, nights. We created a custom data-processing pipeline to mitigate common challenges in decametric radio astronomy, including radio frequency interference, ionospheric distortions, and sidelobe noise from nearby bright radio sources. We used this pipeline to image the field around Tau Bo\"otis b, searching for both quiescent and bursting emission from the direction of Tau Bo\"otis b. Despite the high sensitivity of the interferometric observations and extensive data processing, no significant emission was detected from Tau Bo\"otis b in Stokes V. We establish an upper limit of 2 sigma at 24 mJy for any continuous emission from the exoplanet. The previous tentative detection of 400 mJy is thus not confirmed by the interferometric observations. The previous tentative detection is unlikely to be a bona fide astrophysical signal. Our upper limit is lower than the flux density predicted by scaling laws, meaning either the scaling laws need to be revised or the emission from this particular system is beamed away from Earth.</description>

      <title>The TESS-Keck Survey XXIV: Outer Giants may be More Prevalent in the Presence of Inner Small Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the Distant Giants Survey, a three-year radial velocity (RV) campaign to search for wide-separation giant planets orbiting Sun-like stars known to host an inner transiting planet. We defined a distant giant to have $a$ = 1--10 AU and $M_{p} \sin i = 70-4000$ \mearth~ = 0.2-12.5 \mj, and required transiting planets to have $a&lt;1$ AU and $R_{p} = 1-4$ \rearth. We assembled our sample of 47 stars using a single selection function, and observed each star at monthly intervals to obtain $\approx$30 RV observations per target. The final catalog includes a total of twelve distant companions: four giant planets detected during our survey, two previously known giant planets, and six objects of uncertain disposition identified through RV/astrometric accelerations. Statistically, half of the uncertain objects are planets and the remainder are stars/brown dwarfs. We calculated target-by-target completeness maps to account for missed planets. We found evidence for a moderate enhancement of distant giants (DG) in the presence of close-in small planets (CS), P(DG|CS) = $30^{+14}_{-12}\%$, over the field rate of P(DG) = $16^{+2}_{-2}\%$. No enhancement is disfavored ($p \sim$ 8%). In contrast to a previous study, we found no evidence that stellar metallicity enhances P(DG|CS). We found evidence that distant giant companions are preferentially found in systems with multiple transiting planets and have lower eccentricities than randomly selected giant planets. This points toward dynamically cool formation pathways for the giants that do not disturb the inner systems.</description>

      <title>From Stability to Instability: Characterizing the Eccentricities of Multi-planet Systems in the California Kepler Survey as a Means of Studying Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the stability of exoplanet systems is crucial for constraining planetary formation and evolution theories. We use the machine-learning stability indicator, SPOCK, to characterize the stability of 126 high-multiplicity systems from the California Kepler Survey (CKS). We constrain the range of stable eccentricities for each system, adopting the value associated with a 50% chance of stability as the characteristic eccentricity. We confirm characteristic eccentricities via a small suite of N-body integrations. In studying correlations between characteristic eccentricity and various planet-pair and system-level metrics we find that minimum period ratio correlates most strongly with characteristic eccentricity. These characteristic eccentricities are approximately 20% of the eccentricities necessary for two-body mean-motion resonance overlap, suggesting three-body dynamics are needed to drive future instabilities. Systems in which the eccentricities would need to be high (&gt; 0.15) to drive instability are likely dynamically relaxed and might be the fossils of a previous epoch of giant impacts that increased the typical planet-planet spacing.</description>

      <title>The heating efficiency of hot Jupiters from a data-driven perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inflated radii of hot Jupiters have been explored by various theoretical mechanisms. By connecting planetary thermal evolution models with the observed properties of hot Jupiters using hierarchical Bayesian models, a theoretical parameter called the heating efficiency has been introduced to describe the heating of the interiors of these planets. Previous studies have shown that the marginal distribution of this heating efficiency parameter has a single-peak distribution along the planetary equilibrium temperature (Teq). Since the foundation of these Bayesian inference models are the observed properties of hot Jupiters, there must be a corresponding feature in the observed data that leads to the inferred single-peak distribution of the heating efficiency. This study aims to find the underlying cause of the single-peak heating efficiency distribution without relying on specific theoretical models. By analyzing the relationship between different observed physical properties, we obtained a similar single-peak distribution of the radius expansion efficiency of hot Jupiters along Teq, which can be explained by the correlation with the stellar effective temperature. However, a detailed investigation suggests that this single-peak distribution is actually the result of straightforward physical processes. Specifically, the increase in heating efficiency can be attributed to the increase in incident stellar flux, while the decrease in heating efficiency can be attributed to the rise in gravitational binding energy associated with the increase in planetary mass.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) as an Extraterrestrial Atmospheric Technosignature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons are prevalent in the universe and interstellar medium but are primarily attributed to anthropogenic sources on Earth, such as fossil fuel combustion and firewood burning. Drawing upon the idea of PAHs as suitable candidates for technosignatures, we investigate the detectability of those PAHs that have available absorption cross-sections in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets (orbiting G-type stars at a distance of 10 parsecs) with an 8m mirror of Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). Specifically, we focus on Naphthalene, Anthracene, Phenanthrene, and Pyrene. Our simulations indicate that under current Earth-like conditions, detecting PAH signatures between 0.2-0.515 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ is infeasible. To account for the historical decline in PAH production post-industrial revolution, we explore varying PAH concentrations to assess instrumental capabilities to detect civilizations resembling modern Earth. We also evaluate telescope architectures (6m, 8m, and 10m mirror diameters) to put our results into the context of the future HWO mission. With these four molecules, PAH detection remains infeasible, even at concentrations ten times higher than current levels. While larger mirrors provide some advantages, they fail to resolve the spectral signatures of these molecules with significant signal-to-noise ratios. The UV absorption features of PAHs, caused by $\mathrm{\pi}$-orbital $\rightarrow$ $\mathrm{\pi^*}$-orbital electronic transitions, serve as valuable markers due to their distinct and detectable nature, preserved by the aromatic stability of PAHs. Additional lab measurements are necessary to gather absorption cross-section data beyond UV for more abundant PAHs. This may help further in improving the detectability of these molecules.</description>

      <title>Mission Analysis for the First-Ever Saturn Trojan 2019 UO$_{14}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mid-2024, asteroid 2019 UO$_{14}$ was identified as the first-ever Saturn Trojan through ground-based archival observations and numerical simulations. Trojans, including those associated with Jupiter and other planets, raise important questions about the formation processes of our solar system. Exploring this Trojan object with spacecraft may provide direct answers and definitive evidence regarding these questions. This paper thoroughly investigates potential mission scenarios to the first Saturn Trojan, 2019 UO$_{14}$, to determine the necessary launch window and spacecraft specifications. First, by assuming a ballistic flight using chemical engines, optimal sequences of events, including (powered) gravity-assist maneuvers and deep-space maneuvers, are identified through a meta-heuristic global trajectory optimization algorithm. The analysis indicates that flyby exploration is feasible with a launch window around 2034 and a $\Delta V$ ranging from 92 m/s to 1041 m/s within an 11-year mission duration, while a rendezvous can be achieved with a departure around 2035 and a $\Delta V$ of 2-3 km/s. Specifically, the itinerary via Saturn requires a $\Delta V$ of 2 km/s and a flight time of 24.6 years, while the route via Jupiter results in a $\Delta V$ of 3 km/s and a flight time of 13.4 years. Given that the orbital motion of outer solar system objects is relatively slow, low-thrust propulsion, which gradually accelerates the spacecraft, proves to be effective. Consequently, low-thrust trajectories to 2019 UO$_{14}$ were examined. The results demonstrate that a rendezvous can be accomplished with nearly the same departure epoch, time of flight, and $\Delta V$ as in the ballistic flight, suggesting that low-thrust propulsion is highly compatible with the rendezvous scenario, as it significantly reduces the propellant mass fraction.</description>

      <title>Long-lived Habitable Zones around White Dwarfs undergoing Neon-22 Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarf stars have attracted considerable attention in the past 15 years as hosts for potentially habitable planets, but their low luminosity and continuous cooling are major challenges for habitability. Recently, astronomers have found that about 6% of massive white dwarfs seem to have "paused" their cooling for up to ~10 Gyr. The leading explanation for this cooling delay is the distillation of neutron-rich isotopes such as $^{22}$Ne in the white dwarf's interior, which releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy as the star's internal structure rearranges. Here, we consider the impact of $^{22}$Ne distillation on the evolution of white dwarf habitable zones. We find that $^{22}$Ne distillation in the white dwarf host dramatically increases the time that a planet can continuously reside within the habitable zone (giving more time for life to arise) and that long-lasting habitable zones are located farther from the star (decreasing the impact of tidal forces). These properties may make white dwarfs undergoing $^{22}$Ne distillation more promising locations for habitability than white dwarfs undergoing standard cooling.</description>

      <title>Study of Migration of Giant Planets and Formation of Populations of Distant Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Nice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of the interaction of giant planets and the planetesimal disk was carried out for the Nice model, in which the initial orbits of the planets are in resonant configurations. In addition to the standard Nice model, planetesimals in the planetary region were considered and the self-gravity of the planetesimal disk was taken into account. The dynamical evolution of planetary systems has been studied for time intervals on the order of the lifetime of the Solar System. We have found cases in which the planetary systems survive for billions of years, the final orbits of the planets are close to the present orbits, and distant trans-Neptunian objects exist.</description>

      <title>Rotation periods of asteroids from light curves of TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical evolution of asteroids through the secular Yarkovsky effect requires the determination of many physical properties, including the rotation period. We propose a method aimed at obtaining a robust determination of the rotation period of asteroids, while avoiding the pitfalls of aliases. We applied this approach to thousands of asteroid light curves measured by the NASA TESS mission. We developed a robust period-analysis algorithm based on a Fourier series. Our approach includes a comparison of the results from multiple orders and tests on the number of extremes to identify and reject potential aliases. We also provide the uncertainty interval for the result as well as additional periods that may be plausible. We report the rotation period for 4521 asteroids within a precision of 10%. A comparison with the literature (whenever available) reveals a very good agreement and validates the approach presented here. Our approach also highlights cases for which the determination of the period should be considered invalid. The dataset presented here confirms the apparent small number of asteroids with a rotation between 50 and 100 h and correlated with diameter. The amplitude of the light curves is found to increase toward smaller diameters, as asteroids become less and less spherical. Finally, there is a systematic difference between the broad C and S complex in the amplitude-period, revealing the statistically lower density of C-types compared to S-type asteroids. Conclusions. Our approach to the determination of asteroid rotation period is based on simple concepts, yet it is nonetheless robust. It can be applied to large corpora of time series photometry, such as those extracted from exoplanet transit surveys.</description>

Abstract: We report a spectroscopic observation of comet C/2023 A3 using an 80 mm apochromatic (apo) refractor equipped with a custom-built spectrometer with a resolution of R~2,500 on the night of 4 October 2024. Sodium D lines were detected prominently, while no other emission lines, particularly carbon-bearing species, were observed, which suggests that comet C/2023 A3 may be carbon-depleted. The mobility and flexibility of our observational setup highlight the value of amateur telescopes in observing low-altitude targets like C/2023 A3 as a complement to professional facilities.</description>

      <title>Is planetary inward migration responsible for GJ 504's fast rotation and bright X-ray luminosity? New constraints from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of an increasing variety of exoplanets in very close orbits around their host stars raised many questions about how stars and planets interact, and to which extent host stars' properties may be influenced by the presence of close-by companions. Understanding how the evolution of stars is impacted by the interactions with their planets is fundamental to disentangle their intrinsic evolution from Star-Planet Interactions (SPI)-induced phenomena. GJ 504 is a promising candidate for a star that underwent strong SPI. Its unusually short rotational period (3.4 days), while being in contrast with what is expected by single-star models, could result from the inward migration of a close-by, massive companion, pushed starward by tides. Moreover, its brighter X-ray luminosity may hint at a rejuvenation of the dynamo process sustaining the stellar magnetic field, consequent to the SPI-induced spin-up. We aim to study the evolution of GJ 504 and establish whether by invoking the engulfment of a planetary companion we can better reproduce its rotational period and X-ray luminosity. We simulate the past evolution assuming two different scenarios: 'Star without close-by planet', 'Star with close-by planet'. In the second scenario, we investigate how inward migration and planetary engulfment driven by tides spin up the stellar surface and rejuvenate its dynamo. We compare our tracks with rotational period and X-ray data collected from the all-sky surveys of the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG). Despite the very uncertain stellar age, we found that the second evolutionary scenario is in better agreement with the short rotational period and the bright X-ray luminosity of GJ 504, thus strongly favouring the inward migration scenario over the one in which close-by planets have no tidal impact on the star.</description>

      <title>Dusty disk as a safe haven for terrestrial planets: Effect of back-reaction of solid material on gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the dust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing growth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted by the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio of protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often neglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the torques felt by low-mass planets. We perform locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the range of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations are compared with and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on the gas. The solid component is assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the range 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater number of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect back-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth and migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas back-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized planetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk containing coupled solid components St&lt;=0.01. Earth-mass planets also experience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid components 2&lt;=St&lt;=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to increase the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results suggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial to the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young planet being engulfed by the central star.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional transport of solids in a protoplanetary disk containing a growing giant planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of combined hydrodynamic and particle tracking post-processing modeling to study the transport of small dust in a protoplanetary disk containing an embedded embryo in 3D. We use a suite of FARGO3D hydrodynamic simulations of disks containing a planetary embryo varying in mass up to 300 $M_\oplus$ on a fixed orbit in both high and low viscosity disks. We then simulate solid particles through the disk as a post-processing step using a Monte Carlo integration, allowing us to track the trajectories of individual particles as they travel throughout the disk. We find that gas advection onto the planet can carry small, well-coupled solids across the gap opened in the disk by the embedded planet for planetary masses above the pebble isolation mass. This mixing between the inner and outer disk can occur in both directions, with solids in the inner disk mixing to the outer disk as well. Additionally, in low viscosity disks, multiple pile-ups in the outer disk may preserve isotopic heterogeneities, possibly providing an outermost tertiary isotopic reservoir. Throughout Jupiter's growth, the extent of mixing between isotopic reservoirs varied depending on dust size, gas turbulence, and the Jovian embryo mass.</description>

      <title>LensNet: Enhancing Real-time Microlensing Event Discovery with Recurrent Neural Networks in the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional microlensing event vetting methods require highly trained human experts, and the process is both complex and time-consuming. This reliance on manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates. To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background, the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our training set and continue to refine the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Study Self-lensing/Eclipsing Signals in Edge-on Double White-Dwarf Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar lightcurves from edge-on double white dwarf systems(DWDs) have periodic lensing/eclipsing signals at times of alignment between two components as seen by the observer. Here, we study the characterization and detection of these signals. In common DWDs, the Einstein radii have similar orders of magnitude with WDs' radii, and the projected source and lens radii normalized to the Einstein radius ($\rho_{\star}$, and $\rho_{\rm l}$) are $\sim 1$. Both of them are reduced with the orbital period and the lens mass. If $\rho_{\rm l}\simeq 1$ the lensing-induced minor image is always blocked by the lens which results lower magnification factors. If $\rho_{\rm l}\lesssim 1$ and in transit events the finite-lens effects decrease the lightcurves' width. When $\rho_{\rm l}\gtrsim1$ (happens for close DWDs including one low-mass and one massive WD) deep or complete eclipses dominate to lensing effects. The self-lensing signals maximize for massive DWDs in wide orbits. We study the detect-ability of lensing/eclipsing signals in edge-on DWDs in observations by The NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite(TESS), The Vera Rubin Observatory(LSST) and The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We simulate stellar lightcurves due to edge-on DWDs and generate synthetic data points based on their observing strategies. Detection efficiency maximizes for extremely low-mass WDs in close orbits, and the numbers of DWDs within 100 pc and an observing cone with detectable lensing/eclipsing signals in one $27.4$-day TESS and $62$-day Roman observing window are $\sim1$ and $&lt;1$, respectively. Detecting these signals by LSST is barely possible because of its long cadence.</description>

      <title>The I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars under Newtonian gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moment of inertia and tidal deformability of idealized stars with polytropic equations of state (EOSs) are numerically calculated under both Newtonian gravity and general relativity (GR). The results explicitly confirm that the relation between the moment of inertia and tidal deformability, parameterized by the star's mass, exhibits variations of 1% to 10% for different polytropic indices in Newtonian gravity and GR, respectively. This indicates a more robust I-Love universal relation in the Newtonian framework. The theoretically derived I-Love universal relation for polytropic stars is subsequently tested against observational data for the moment of inertia and tidal deformability of the 8 planets and some moons in our solar system. The analysis reveals that the theoretical I-Love universal relation aligns well with the observational data, suggesting that it can serve as an empirical relation. Consequently, it enables the estimation of either the moment of inertia or the tidal deformability of an exoplanet if one of these quantities, along with the mass of the exoplanet, is known.</description>

      <title>A differentiable binary microlensing model using adaptive contour integration method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present microlux, which is a Jax-based code that can compute the binary microlensing light curve and its derivatives both efficiently and accurately. The key feature of microlux is the implementation of a modified version of the adaptive sampling algorithm that was originally proposed by V. Bozza to account for the finite-source effect most efficiently. The efficiency and accuracy of microlux have been verified across the relevant parameter space for binary microlensing. As a differentiable code, microlux makes it possible to apply gradient-based algorithms to the search and posterior estimation of the microlensing modeling. As an example, we use microlux to model a real microlensing event and infer the model posterior via both Fisher information matrix and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, neither of which would have been possible without the access to accurate model gradients.</description>

      <title>X-ray activity of nearby G-, K-, and M-type stars and implications for planet habitability around M stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The intense X-ray and UV emission of some active M stars has raised questions about the habitability of planets around M-type stars. Aims. We aim to determine the unbiased distribution of X-ray luminosities in complete, volume-limited samples of nearby M dwarfs, and compare them to those of K and G dwarfs. Methods. We constructed volume-complete samples of 205 M stars with a spectral type $\leq$ M6 within 10 pc of the Sun, 129 K stars within 16 pc, and 107 G stars within 20 pc. We used X-ray data from Chandra, XMM-Newton, eROSITA, and ROSAT to obtain the X-ray luminosities of the stars. Results. Our samples reach an X-ray detection completeness of 85%, 86%, and 80% for M, K, and G stars, respectively. The fractional X-ray luminosities relative to the bolometric luminosities, $\log(L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol})$, of the M stars show a bimodal distribution, with one peak at around -5, mostly contributed by early M stars (M0--M4), and another peak around -3.5, contributed mainly by M4--M6 stars. The comparison of the different spectral classes shows that 63% of all M stars in our sample (80% of the M stars with a spectral type $&lt;$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ values that are within the central 80% quantile of the distribution function for G stars. In addition, 55% of all M stars in our sample (and 72% of the M stars with a spectral type $&lt;$ M4) have $L_\mathrm{X}/L_\mathrm{bol}$ less than 10 times the solar value. Conclusions. The X-ray activity levels of the majority ($\ge 60\%$) of nearby M dwarfs no later than M6 are actually not higher than the typical (80% quantile) levels for G-type stars. The X-ray irradiation of habitable-zone planets around these stars should therefore not present a specific problem for their habitability.</description>

      <title>Rossby wave instability in weakly ionized protoplanetary disks. I. azimuthal or vertical B-fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rossby wave instability (RWI) is considered the underlying mechanism to crescent-shaped azimuthal asymmetries, discovered in (sub-)millimeter dust continuum of many protoplanetary disks. Previous works on linear theory were conducted in the hydrodynamic limit. Nevertheless, protoplanetary disks are likely magnetized and weakly ionized. We examine the influence of magnetic fields and non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects - namely, Ohmic resistivity, Hall drift, and ambipolar diffusion - on the RWI unstable modes. We perform radially global linear analyses, employing constant azimuthal ($B_\phi$) or vertical ($B_z$) background magnetic fields. It is found that, in the ideal MHD regime, magnetism can either enhance or diminish RWI growth. Strong non-ideal MHD effects cause RWI growth rates to recover hydrodynamic results. The sign of Hall Els\"{a}sser number subtly complicates the results, and vertical wavenumbers generically diminish growth rates.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Jupiter Analog Misaligned to the Inner Planetary System in HD 73344</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of a Jupiter-like planet, HD 73344 d ($m_{d}=2.55^{+0.56}_{-0.46}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$, $a_{d}=6.70^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ AU, $e_{d}=0.18^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) based on 27-year radial velocity observations. HD 73344 also hosts a compact inner planetary system, including a transiting sub-Neptune HD 73344 b ($P_{b}=15.61\ \mathrm{days}$, $r_{b}=2.88^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and a non-transiting Saturn-mass planet ($P_{c}=65.936\ \mathrm{days}$, $m_{c}\sin{i_c}=0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\ \mathrm{M_{J}}$). By analyzing TESS light curves, we identified a stellar rotation period of $9.03\pm{1.3}$ days. Combining this with $v\sin{i_*}$ measurements from stellar spectra, we derived a stellar inclination of $63.6^{+17.4}_{-16.5}\ \rm{deg} $. Furthermore, by combining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we characterized the three-dimensional orbit of the outer giant planet and constrained its mutual inclination relative to the innermost transiting planet to be $46 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 134\ \rm{deg}\ (1\sigma)$ and $20 &lt;\Delta I_{bd}&lt; 160\ \rm{deg}\ (2\sigma)$, strongly disfavoring coplanar architectures. Our analytical calculations and N-body simulation reveal that the two inner planets are strongly coupled with each other and undergo nodal precession together around the orbital axis of the giant planet. During nodal precession, the orbital inclination of inner planets oscillate with time and therefore become misaligned relative to the stellar spin axis. The formation of such systems suggests a history of planet-planet scattering or misalignment between the inner and outer components of protoplanetary disks. The upcoming release of Gaia DR4 will uncover more systems similar to HD 73344 and enable the study of the flatness of exoplanet systems with a mixture of inner and outer planetary systems on a statistical level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a dark matter caustic passing through the Solar System. We find, confirming a previous result, that the Sun tracks the caustic surface for some time. We integrate numerically the equations of motion of the Sun and a comet for a large number of initial conditions and of caustic passage properties. We calculate the probability for the comet to escape the Solar System and the probability for it to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun, given the initial semimajor axis and eccentricity of its orbit. We find that the average probability for a comet to fall within 50 A.U. of the Sun is of order $3 \times 10^{-4}$ and that comets which are initially at a distance larger than about $10^5$ A.U. have a probability of order one to be ejected from the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Life in the Bubble: How a Nearby Supernova Left Ephemeral Footprints on the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum and Indelible Imprints on Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth sits inside a 300pc-wide void that was carved by a series of supernova explosions that went off tens of millions of years ago, pushing away interstellar gas and creating a bubble-like structure. The $^{60}$Fe peak deposits found in the deep-sea crust have been interpreted by the imprints left by the ejecta of supernova explosions occurring about 2-3 and 5-6 Myr ago. It is likely that the $^{60}$Fe peak at about 2-3 Myr originated from a supernova occurring in the Upper Centaurus Lupus association in Scorpius Centaurus ($\approx$140 pc) or the Tucana Horologium association ($\approx$70 pc). Whereas, the $\approx$ 5-6 Myr peak is likely attributed to the solar system's entrance into the bubble. In this {\it Letter}, we show that the supernova source responsible for synthesizing the $^{60}$Fe peak deposits $\approx$ 2-3 Myr ago can consistently explain the cosmic-ray spectrum and the large-scale anisotropy between 100 TeV and 100 PeV. The cosmic-ray knee could then potentially be attributed entirely to a single nearby "Pevatron" source. Matching the intensity and shape of the cosmic-ray spectrum allows us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic-ray energy content from the supernova as well as on the cosmic-ray diffusion coefficient. Making use of such constraints we provide a robust estimate of the temporal variation of terrestrial ionizing cosmic radiation levels and discuss their implications in the development of early life on Earth by plausibly influencing the mutation rate and, as such, conceivably assisting in the evolution of complex organisms.</description>

      <title>Early Grain Growth in the Young Protostellar Disk HH 212 Supported by Dust Self-Scattering Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\mathrm{\beta}$ of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source. For the VLA bands, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling to avoid free-free emission contamination. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\beta$ (with a value of $\sim$ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\sim$ 130 $\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk. The values of the absorption opacities further highlight the need for a new dust composition model for Class 0/I disks.</description>

Abstract: The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory is intended to observe the atmospheres of nearby terrestrial exoplanets with a resolution greater than that of any previous instrument. While these observations present a substantial opportunity for astrobiology, they also incur the risk of false positives and false negatives. Here, we explore the use of systems science (in the form of network theory and thermochemical kinetics) to mitigate these risks, and briefly describe the technical specifications HWO would require in order to use these methodologies.</description>
