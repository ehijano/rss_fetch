      <title>Handwriting Anomalies and Learning Disabilities through Recurrent Neural Networks and Geometric Pattern Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyslexia and dysgraphia are learning disabilities that significantly impact reading, writing, and language processing capabilities. Dyslexia primarily affects reading, manifesting as difficulties in word recognition and phonological processing, where individuals struggle to connect sounds with corresponding letters. Dysgraphia, on the other side, affects writing abilities, leading to problems with letter formation, spacing, and alignment. Coexistence of these disorders complicates diagnosis. This necessitates a nuanced approach that can adapt to these changes and still accurately identify and differentiate between these disorders. This study utilizes advanced geometrical patterns and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to identify handwriting anomalies indicative of dyslexia and dysgraphia. Handwriting standardized features followed by feature extraction that focuses on baseline deviations, letter connectivity, stroke thickness and other anomalies into RNN based autoencoder to identify irregularities. Initial results show the challenge associated with complex pattern adaptation.</description>

      <title>PLA-SGCN: Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction by Integrating Similar Pairs and Semi-supervised Graph Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The protein-ligand binding affinity (PLA) prediction goal is to predict whether or not the ligand could bind to a protein sequence. Recently, in PLA prediction, deep learning has received much attention. Two steps are involved in deep learning-based approaches: feature extraction and task prediction step. Many deep learning-based approaches concentrate on introducing new feature extraction networks or integrating auxiliary knowledge like protein-protein interaction networks or gene ontology knowledge. Then, a task prediction network is designed simply using some fully connected layers. This paper aims to integrate retrieved similar hard protein-ligand pairs in PLA prediction (i.e., task prediction step) using a semi-supervised graph convolutional network (GCN). Hard protein-ligand pairs are retrieved for each input query sample based on the manifold smoothness constraint. Then, a graph is learned automatically in which each node is a protein-ligand pair, and each edge represents the similarity between pairs. In other words, an end-to-end framework is proposed that simultaneously retrieves hard similar samples, learns protein-ligand descriptor, learns the graph topology of the input sample with retrieved similar hard samples (learn adjacency matrix), and learns a semi-supervised GCN to predict the binding affinity (as task predictor). The training step adjusts the parameter values, and in the inference step, the learned model is fine-tuned for each input sample. To evaluate the proposed approach, it is applied to the four well-known PDBbind, Davis, KIBA, and BindingDB datasets. The results show that the proposed method significantly performs better than the comparable approaches.</description>

      <title>A Demographic-Conditioned Variational Autoencoder for fMRI Distribution Sampling and Removal of Confounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: fMRI and derived measures such as functional connectivity (FC) have been used to predict brain age, general fluid intelligence, psychiatric disease status, and preclinical neurodegenerative disease. However, it is not always clear that all demographic confounds, such as age, sex, and race, have been removed from fMRI data. Additionally, many fMRI datasets are restricted to authorized researchers, making dissemination of these valuable data sources challenging. Methods: We create a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based model, DemoVAE, to decorrelate fMRI features from demographics and generate high-quality synthetic fMRI data based on user-supplied demographics. We train and validate our model using two large, widely used datasets, the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) and Bipolar and Schizophrenia Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP). Results: We find that DemoVAE recapitulates group differences in fMRI data while capturing the full breadth of individual variations. Significantly, we also find that most clinical and computerized battery fields that are correlated with fMRI data are not correlated with DemoVAE latents. An exception are several fields related to schizophrenia medication and symptom severity. Conclusion: Our model generates fMRI data that captures the full distribution of FC better than traditional VAE or GAN models. We also find that most prediction using fMRI data is dependent on correlation with, and prediction of, demographics. Significance: Our DemoVAE model allows for generation of high quality synthetic data conditioned on subject demographics as well as the removal of the confounding effects of demographics. We identify that FC-based prediction tasks are highly influenced by demographic confounds.</description>

      <title>CANA v1.0.0 and schematodes: efficient quantification of symmetry in Boolean automata</title>

Abstract: The biomolecular networks underpinning cell function exhibit canalization, or the buffering of fluctuations required to function in a noisy environment. One understudied putative mechanism for canalization is the functional equivalence of a biomolecular entity's regulators (e.g., among the transcription factors for a gene). In these discrete dynamical systems, activation and inhibition of biomolecular entities (e.g., transcription of genes) are modeled as the activity of coupled 2-state automata, and thus the equivalence of regulators can be studied using the theory of symmetry in discrete functions. To this end, we present a new exact algorithm for finding maximal symmetry groups among the inputs to discrete functions. We implement this algorithm in Rust as a Python package, schematodes. We include schematodes in the new CANA v1.0.0 release, an open source Python library for analyzing canalization in Boolean networks, which we also present here. We compare our exact method implemented in schematodes to the previously published inexact method used in earlier releases of CANA and find that schematodes significantly outperforms the prior method both in speed and accuracy. We also apply CANA v1.0.0 to study the symmetry properties of regulatory function from an ensemble of experimentally-supported Boolean networks from the Cell Collective. Using CANA v1.0.0, we find that the distribution of a previously reported symmetry parameter, $k_s/k$, is statistically significantly different in the Cell Collective than in random automata with the same in-degree and activation bias (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, $p&lt;0.001$). In particular, its spread is much wider than in our null model (IQR 0.31 vs IQR 0.20 with equal medians), demonstrating that the Cell Collective is enriched in functions with extreme symmetry or asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Rene: A Pre-trained Multi-modal Architecture for Auscultation of Respiratory Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel methodology utilizing a pre-trained speech recognition model for processing respiratory sound data. By incorporating medical record information, we introduce an innovative multi-modal deep-learning architecture, named Rene, which addresses the challenges of poor interpretability and underperformance in real-time clinical diagnostic response observed in previous respiratory disease-focused models. The proposed Rene architecture demonstrated significant improvements of 10.24%, 16.15%, 15.29%, and 18.90% respectively, compared to the baseline across four tasks related to respiratory event detection and audio record classification on the SPRSound database. In patient disease prediction tests on the ICBHI database, the architecture exhibited improvements of 23% in the mean of average score and harmonic score compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we developed a real-time respiratory sound discrimination system based on the Rene architecture, featuring a dual-thread design and compressed model parameters for simultaneous microphone recording and real-time dynamic decoding. Employing state-of-the-art Edge AI technology, this system enables rapid and accurate responses for respiratory sound auscultation, facilitating deployment on wearable clinical detection devices to capture incremental data, which can be synergistically evolved with large-scale models deployed on cloud servers for downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>TemPL: A Novel Deep Learning Model for Zero-Shot Prediction of Protein Stability and Activity Based on Temperature-Guided Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03780v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce TemPL, a novel deep learning approach for zero-shot prediction of protein stability and activity, harnessing temperature-guided language modeling. By assembling an extensive dataset of 96 million sequence-host bacterial strain optimal growth temperatures (OGTs) and {\Delta}Tm data for point mutations under consistent experimental conditions, we effectively compared TemPL with state-of-the-art models. Notably, TemPL demonstrated superior performance in predicting protein stability. An ablation study was conducted to elucidate the influence of OGT prediction and language modeling modules on TemPL's performance, revealing the importance of integrating both components. Consequently, TemPL offers considerable promise for protein engineering applications, facilitating the design of mutation sequences with enhanced stability and activity.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Measure Transport: Outlook for Applications in the Biological Sciences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15366v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One among several advantages of measure transport methods is that they allow for a unified framework for processing and analysis of data distributed according to a wide class of probability measures. Within this context, we present results from computational studies aimed at assessing the potential of measure transport techniques, specifically, the use of triangular transport maps, as part of a workflow intended to support research in the biological sciences. Scenarios characterized by the availability of limited amount of sample data, which are common in domains such as radiation biology, are of particular interest. We find that when estimating a distribution density function given limited amount of sample data, adaptive transport maps are advantageous. In particular, statistics gathered from computing series of adaptive transport maps, trained on a series of randomly chosen subsets of the set of available data samples, leads to uncovering information hidden in the data. As a result, in the radiation biology application considered here, this approach provides a tool for generating hypotheses about gene relationships and their dynamics under radiation exposure.</description>

      <title>Wireless Ear EEG to Monitor Drowsiness</title>

Abstract: Neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness and health monitoring for pilots and drivers. While existing in-cabin sensors may provide alerts, wearables can enable monitoring across more environments. Current neural wearables are promising but most require wet-electrodes and bulky electronics. This work showcases in-ear, dry-electrode earpieces used to monitor drowsiness with compact hardware. The employed system integrates additive-manufacturing for dry, user-generic earpieces, existing wireless electronics, and offline classification algorithms. Thirty-five hours of electrophysiological data were recorded across nine subjects performing drowsiness-inducing tasks. Three classifier models were trained with user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out splits. The support-vector-machine classifier achieved an accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate wireless, dry, user-generic earpieces used to classify drowsiness with comparable accuracies to existing state-of-the-art, wet electrode in-ear and scalp systems. Further, this work illustrates the feasibility of population-trained classification in future electrophysiological applications.</description>

      <title>Learning to Extend Molecular Scaffolds with Structural Motifs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.03864v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning-based modeling of molecules promise to accelerate in silico drug discovery. A plethora of generative models is available, building molecules either atom-by-atom and bond-by-bond or fragment-by-fragment. However, many drug discovery projects require a fixed scaffold to be present in the generated molecule, and incorporating that constraint has only recently been explored. Here, we propose MoLeR, a graph-based model that naturally supports scaffolds as initial seed of the generative procedure, which is possible because it is not conditioned on the generation history. Our experiments show that MoLeR performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods on unconstrained molecular optimization tasks, and outperforms them on scaffold-based tasks, while being an order of magnitude faster to train and sample from than existing approaches. Furthermore, we show the influence of a number of seemingly minor design choices on the overall performance.</description>
