      <title>Harmonic maps from post-critically finite fractals to the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every continuous map between two compact Riemannian manifolds is homotopic to a harmonic map (HM). We show that a similar situation holds for continuous maps between a post-critically finite (p.c.f.) fractal and a circle. Specifically, we provide a geometric proof of Strichartz's theorem stating that for a given degree and appropriate boundary conditions there is a unique HM from the Sierpinski Gasket (SG) to a circle. Furthermore, we extend this result to HMs on p.c.f. fractals.
  Our method uses covering spaces for the SG, which are constructed separately for HMs of a given degree, thus capturing the topology intrinsic to each homotopy class. After lifting continuous functions on the SG with values in the unit circle to continuous real-valued functions on the covering space, we use the harmonic extension algorithm to obtain a harmonic function on the covering space. The desired HM is obtained by restricting the domain of the resultant harmonic function to the fundamental domain and projecting the range to the circle.
  We show that with suitable modifications the method applies to p.c.f. fractals, a large class of self-similar domains. We illustrate our method of constructing the HMs using numerical examples of HMs from the SG to the circle and discuss the construction of the covering spaces for several representative p.c.f. fractals, including the 3-level SG, the hexagasket, and the pentagasket.</description>

      <title>Griffiths polynomials of $q$-Racah type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New bivariate Griffiths polynomials of $q$-Racah type are introduced and characterized. They generalize the polynomials orthogonal on the multinomial distribution introduced by R. Griffiths fifty years ago. They also correspond to a $q$-deformation of the Griffiths polynomials of Racah type introduced previously by the authors and collaborators. The latter are recovered from the former by a $q\to1$ limit. We show that these new polynomials are bispectral and biorthogonal. We also exhibit some symmetry relations that are essential in the proof of the bispectrality property.</description>

      <title>Generation of chaos in the cumulant hierarchy of the stochastic Kac model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the time-evolution of cumulants of velocities and kinetic energies in the stochastic Kac model for velocity exchange of $N$ particles, with the aim of quantifying how fast these degrees of freedom become chaotic in a time scale in which the collision rate for each particle is order one. Chaos here is understood in the sense of the original Sto\ss zahlansatz, as an almost complete independence of the particle velocities which we measure by the magnitude of their cumulants up to a finite, but arbitrary order. Known spectral gap results imply that typical initial densities converge to uniform distribution on the constant energy sphere at a time which has order of $N$ expected collisions. We prove that the finite order cumulants converge to their small stationary values much faster, already at a time scale of order one collisions. The proof relies on stability analysis of the closed, but nonlinear, hierarchy of energy cumulants around the fixed point formed by their values in the stationary spherical distribution. It provides the first example of an application of the cumulant hierarchy method to control the properties of a microscopic model related to kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Vertex Weight Reconstruction in the Gel'fand's Inverse Problem on Connected Weighted Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the reconstruction of the vertex weight in the discrete Gel'fand's inverse boundary spectral problem for the graph Laplacian. Given the boundary vertex weight and the edge weight of the graph, we develop reconstruction procedures to recover the interior vertex weight from the Neumann boundary spectral data on a class of finite, connected and weighted graphs. The procedures are divided into two stages: the first stage reconstructs the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map for the graph wave equation from the Neumann boundary spectral data, and the second stage reconstructs the interior vertex weight from the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map using the boundary control method adapted to weighted graphs. For the second stage, we identify a class of weighted graphs where the unique continuation principle holds for the graph wave equation. The reconstruction procedures are further turned into an algorithm, which is implemented and validated on several numerical examples with quantitative performance reported.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories and their classical interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show that it is possible to define a classical system associated with a Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) theory via the implementation of a consistent symplectic structure. This provides a solid framework for the classical Hamiltonian formulation of such theories and the study of the dynamics of physical systems in the corresponding deformed phase space. By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in the configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a general form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we show that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the literature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the superselection of GUP models at the classical level. Finally, we demonstrate that a properly defined GUP theory can be correctly interpreted classically if and only if the corresponding quantum commutators satisfy the Jacobi identities.</description>

      <title>Chiral Soft Algebras for $\mathcal{N} = 2$ Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some time ago, Seiberg and Witten solved for moduli spaces of vacua parameterized by scalar vacuum expectation values in $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories. More recently, new vacua associated to soft theorems and asymptotic symmetries have been found. This paper takes some first steps towards a complete picture of the infrared geometry of $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory incorporating both of these infrared structures.</description>

      <title>The Ground State of the S=1 Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Chain is Topologically Nontrivial if Gapped</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional $S=1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index.</description>

      <title>Coupled Sine-Gordon and $\phi^4$ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupling the fields may lead to the emergence of new phenomena. In the realm of classical fields and nonlinear systems, extensive research has been conducted on their solitary and soliton solutions. In the conducted studies, typically two $\phi^4$ systems, or two sine-Gordon systems, have been coupled. The sine-Gordon system exhibits diverse solutions, all well-behaved, with its soliton solutions fully understood. On the other hand, the $\phi^4$ system, which is significant in field theory, has solitary solutions, but these solutions are not solitonic. For example, from a pair of kink and antikink, we cannot construct a bound state; or that after a collision, these two solutions do not revert to their initial status and become disrupted. In this study, we couple a $\phi^4$ system with a sine-Gordon system to impart stability from the sine-Gordon system to the $\phi^4$ system. We have demonstrated that for a coupled $\phi^4$ and sine-Gordon system, this expectation is somewhat met.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Criterion for Divisibility of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel $\Phi$ is divisible, i.e.~that there exists a non-trivial factorization $\Phi=\Phi_1\Phi_2$. The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel $\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\Phi\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an explicit factorization of $\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors $x,x^\perp$ such that $\langle x^\perp|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\langle x|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\{0\}$ where $\mathcal K_\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of $\Phi$ and $\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\Phi$ into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions of higher-spin supercurrents in 4D $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFT: general formalism for arbitrary superspins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the general structure of the three-point functions involving conserved higher-spin ``vector-like" supercurrents $J_{s}(z) := J_{\alpha(s) \dot{\alpha}(s)}(z)$ in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theory. Using the constraints of superconformal symmetry and superfield conservation equations, we utilise a computational approach to analyse the general structure of the three-point function $\langle J^{}_{s_{1}}(z_{1}) \, J'_{s_{2}}(z_{2}) \, J''_{s_{3}}(z_{3}) \rangle$ and provide a general classification of the results. We demonstrate that the three-point function is fixed up to $2 \min (s_{i}) + 2$ independent conserved structures, which we propose to hold for arbitrary superspins. In addition, we show that the conserved structures can be classified as parity-even or parity-odd in superspace based on their transformation properties under superinversion.</description>

      <title>Exact and asymptotic dissipative spectral form factor for elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF) has recently emerged as a diagnostic tool for assessing non-integrability or chaos in non-Hermitian systems. It extends the concept of the spectral form factor (SFF), a widely used measure for similar investigations in Hermitian systems. In this study, we concentrate on the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian limit of Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian limit of Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by varying a symmetry parameter. We derive exact finite-dimension expression and large-dimension approximation for the DSFF of eGinUE. A key finding of this work is a compelling ``scaling relationship" between the DSFF of eGinUE and that of the GUE or GinUE. This scaling relationship also reveals a previously unobserved connection between the DSFF of GinUE and the SFF of GUE. The DSFF for eGinUE displays a \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure in the GinUE and GUE limits, as well as in the crossover region, with differences in time scales that are well-explained by the aforementioned scaling relationship. Additionally, depending on the symmetry regime within the crossover, we provide various estimates for the Thouless time ($T_\mathrm{Th}$) and Heisenberg time ($T_\mathrm{H}$), which correspond to the dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transitions, respectively. Our analytical results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the eGinUE random matrix model, showing excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>Twisted Riemann bilinear relations and Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the framework of twisted cohomology, we study twisted Riemann bilinear relations (TRBRs) satisfied by multi-loop Feynman integrals and their cuts in dimensional regularisation. After showing how to associate to a given family of Feynman integrals a period matrix whose entries are cuts, we investigate the TRBRs satisfied by this period matrix, its dual and the intersection matrices for twisted cycles and co-cycles. For maximal cuts, the non-relative framework is applicable, and the period matrix and its dual are related in a simple manner. We then find that the TRBRs give rise to quadratic relations that generalise quadratic relations that have previously appeared in the literature. However, we find that the TRBRs do not allow us to obtain quadratic relations for non-maximal cuts or completely uncut Feynman integrals. This can be traced back to the fact that the TRBRs are not quadratic in the period matrix, but separately linear in the period matrix and its dual, and the two are not simply related in the case of a relative cohomology theory, which is required for non-maximal cuts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a fourth order entropy stable extension of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations into the transition regime of rarefied gases. We do this through a novel reformulation of the closure of conservation equations derived from the Boltzmann equation that subsumes existing methods such as the Chapman-Enskog expansion. We apply the linearized version of this extension to the stationary heat problem and the Poiseuille channel and compare our analytical solutions to asymptotic and numerical solutions of the linearized Boltzmann equation. In both model problems, our solutions compare remarkably well in the transition regime. For some macroscopic variables, this agreement even extends far beyond the transition regime.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory motions, parabolic orbits and collision orbits in the planar circular restricted three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the planar circular restricted three body problem (PCRTBP), which models the motion of a massless body under the attraction of other two bodies, the primaries, which describe circular orbits around their common center of mass. In a suitable system of coordinates, this is a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system. The orbits of this system are either defined for all (future or past) time or eventually go to collision with one of the primaries. For orbits defined for all time, Chazy provided a classification of all possible asymptotic behaviors, usually called final motions.
  By considering a sufficiently small mass ratio between the primaries, we analyze the interplay between collision orbits and various final motions and construct several types of dynamics.
  In particular, we show that orbits corresponding to any combination of past and future final motions can be created to pass arbitrarily close to the massive primary. Additionally, we construct arbitrarily large ejection-collision orbits (orbits which experience collision in both past and future times) and periodic orbits that are arbitrarily large and get arbitrarily close to the massive primary. Furthermore, we also establish oscillatory motions in both position and velocity, meaning that as time tends to infinity, the superior limit of the position or velocity is infinity while the inferior limit remains a real number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the first twenty moments of three convergent quartic bi-tracial 2-matrix ensembles in the large $N$ limit. These ensembles are toy models for Euclidean quantum gravity originally proposed by John Barrett and collaborators. A perturbative solution is found for the first twenty moments using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and properties of certain bi-colored unstable maps associated to the model. We then apply a result of Guionnet et al. to show that the perturbative and convergent solution coincide for a small neighbourhood of the coupling constants. For each model we compute an explicit expression for the free energy, critical points, and critical exponents in the large $N$ limit. In particular, the string susceptibility is found to be $\gamma =1/2$, hinting that the associated universality class of the model is the continuous random tree.</description>

      <title>Dimers and M-Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general approach to dimer models analogous to Krichever's scheme in the theory of integrable systems. We start with a Riemann surface and the simplest generic meromorphic functions on it and demonstrate how to obtain integrable dimer models. These are dimer models on doubly periodic bipartite graphs with quasi-periodic positive weights. Dimer models with periodic weights and Harnack curves are recovered as a special case. This generalization from Harnack curves to general M-curves leads to transparent algebro-geometric structures. In particular explicit formulas for the Ronkin function and surface tension as integrals of meromorphic differentials on M-curves are obtained. Furthermore we describe the variational principle for the height function in the quasi-periodic case. Based on Schottky uniformizations of Riemann surfaces we present concrete computational results including computing the weights and sampling dimer configurations with them. The computational results are in complete agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Subharmonic Dynamics of Spectrally Stable Lugiato-Lefever Periodic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear dynamics of perturbed, spectrally stable $T$-periodic stationary solutions of the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), a damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with forcing that arises in nonlinear optics. It is known that for each $N\in\mathbb{N}$, such a $T$-periodic wave train is (orbitally) asymptotically stable against $NT$-periodic, i.e. subharmonic, perturbations. Unfortunately, in such results both the allowable size of initial perturbations as well as the exponential decay rates of perturbations depend on $N$ and, in fact, tend to zero as $N\to\infty$, leading to a lack of uniformity in the period of the perturbation. In recent work, the authors performed a delicate decomposition of the associated linearized solution operator and obtained linear estimates which are uniform in $N$. The dynamical description suggested by this uniform linear theory indicates that the corresponding nonlinear iteration can only be closed if one allows for a spatio-temporal phase modulation of the underlying wave. However, such a modulated perturbation is readily seen to satisfy a quasilinear equation, yielding an inherent loss of regularity. We regain regularity by transferring a nonlinear damping estimate, which has recently been obtained for the LLE in the case of localized perturbations to the case of subharmonic perturbations. Thus, we obtain a nonlinear, subharmonic stability result for periodic stationary solutions of the LLE that is uniform in $N$. This in turn yields an improved nonuniform subharmonic stability result providing an $N$-independent ball of initial perturbations which eventually exhibit exponential decay at an $N$-dependent rate. Finally, we argue that our results connect in the limit $N \to \infty$ to previously established stability results against localized perturbations, thereby unifying existing theories.</description>

      <title>Unconventional conformal invariance of maximal depth partially massless fields on $dS_{4}$ and its relation to complex partially massless SUSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deser and Waldron have shown that maximal depth partially massless theories of higher integer spin on 4-dimensional de Sitter spacetime ($dS_{4}$) possess infinitesimal symmetries generated by the conformal Killing vectors of $dS_{4}$. However, it was later shown by Barnich, Bekaert, and Grigoriev that these theories are not invariant under the conformal algebra $so(4,2)$. To get some insight into these seemingly contradicting results we write down the full set of infinitesimal transformations generated by the 15 conformal Killing vectors of $dS_{4}$. Although the infinitesimal transformations generated by the 10 dS Killing vectors are known, the transformations generated by the 5 non-Killing conformal Killing vectors were absent from the literature, and we show that they have an `unconventional' form. In the spin-2 case, we show that the field equations and the action are invariant under the unconventional conformal transformations. For spin $s &gt;2$, the invariance is demonstrated only at the level of the field equations. For all spins $s \geq 2$, we reproduce the result that the symmetry algebra does not close on $so(4,2)$. This is due to the appearance of higher-derivative symmetries in the commutator of two unconventional conformal transformations. Our results concerning the closure of the full algebra are inconclusive. Then we shift focus to the question of supersymmetry (SUSY) on $dS_{4}$ and our objective is twofold. First, we uncover a non-interacting supermultiplet that consists of a complex partially massless spin-2 field and a complex spin-3/2 field on $dS_{4}$. Second, we showcase the appearance of the unconventional conformal symmetries in the commutator of two SUSY transformations. Thus, this commutator closes on an algebra that is neither $so(4,1)$ nor $so(4,2)$, while its full structure is an open question. More open questions arising from our findings are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Expansion of hypergeometric functions in terms of polylogarithms with nontrivial variable change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required steps.</description>

      <title>Infinite Series Solution of the Time-Dependent Radiative Transfer Equation in Anisotropically Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in anisotropically scattering media as an infinite series. Each series term represents a distinct number of scattering events, with analytical solutions derived for zero and single scattering. Higher-order corrections are addressed through numerical calculations or approximations.
  The RTE solution corresponds to Monte Carlo sampling of photon trajectories with fixed start and end points.
  Validated against traditional Monte Carlo simulations, featuring random end points, our solution demonstrates enhanced efficiency for both anisotropic and isotropic scattering functions, significantly reducing computational time and resources.
  The advantage of our method over Monte Carlo simulations varies with the position of interest and the asymmetry of light scattering, but it is typically orders of magnitude faster while achieving the same level of accuracy.
  The exploitation of hidden symmetries further accelerates our numerical calculations, enhancing the method's overall efficiency.
  In addition, we extend our analysis to the first and second moments of the photon's flux, elucidating the transition between transport and diffusive regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting the explicit bijection between the density of singular values and the density of eigenvalues for bi-unitarily invariant complex random matrix ensembles of finite matrix size, we aim at finding the induced probability measure on $j$ eigenvalues and $k$ singular values that we coin $j,k$-point correlation measure. We find an expression for the $1,k$-point correlation measure which simplifies drastically when assuming that the singular values follow a polynomial ensemble, yielding a closed formula in terms of the kernel corresponding to the determinantal point process of the singular value statistics. These expressions simplify even further when the singular values are drawn from a P\'{o}lya ensemble and extend known results between the eigenvalue and singular value statistics of the corresponding bi-unitarily invariant ensemble.</description>

Abstract: Source identities are fundamental identities between multivariable special functions. We give a geometric derivation of rational and trigonometric source identities. We also give a systematic derivation and extension of various determinant representations for source functions which appeared in previous literature as well as introducing the elliptic version of the determinants, and obtain identities between determinants.

      <title>The directed landscape from Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an almost sure bijection which constructs the directed landscape from a sequence of infinitely many independent Brownian motions. This is the analogue of the RSK correspondence in this setting. The Brownian motions arise as a marginal of the extended Busemann process for the directed landscape, and the inverse map gives an explicit and natural coupling where Brownian last passage percolation converges in probability to the directed landscape. We use this map to prove that the directed landscape on a strip can be reconstructed from the Airy line ensemble. Along the way, we describe two more new versions of RSK in the semi-discrete setting, build a general theory of sorting via Pitman operators, and construct extended Busemann processes for the directed landscape and Brownian last passage percolation.</description>

      <title>Ratchet-mediated resetting: Current, efficiency, and exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We model an overdamped Brownian particle that is subject to resetting facilitated by a ratchet potential on a spatially periodic domain. This asymmetric potential switches on with a constant rate, but switches off again only upon the particle's first passage to a resetting point at the minimum of the potential. Repeating this cycle sustains a non-equilibrium steady-state, as well as a directed steady-state current which can be harnessed to perform useful work. We derive exact analytic expressions for the probability densities of the free-diffusion and resetting phases, the associated currents for each phase, and an efficiency parameter that quantifies the return in current for given power input. These expressions allow us to fully characterise the system and obtain experimentally relevant results such as the optimal current and efficiency. Our results are corroborated by simulations, and have implications for experimentally viable finite-time resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>A time-parallel multiple-shooting method for large-scale quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control plays a crucial role in quantum computing by providing the interface between compiler and hardware. Solving the optimal control problem is particularly challenging for multi-qubit gates, due to the exponential growth in computational complexity with the system's dimensionality and the deterioration of optimization convergence. To ameliorate the computational complexity of time-integration, this paper introduces a multiple-shooting approach in which the time domain is divided into multiple windows and the intermediate states at window boundaries are treated as additional optimization variables. This enables parallel computation of state evolution across time-windows, significantly accelerating objective function and gradient evaluations. Since the initial state matrix in each window is only guaranteed to be unitary upon convergence of the optimization algorithm, the conventional gate trace infidelity is replaced by a generalized infidelity that is convex for non-unitary state matrices. Continuity of the state across window boundaries is enforced by equality constraints. A quadratic penalty optimization method is used to solve the constrained optimal control problem, and an efficient adjoint technique is employed to calculate the gradients in each iteration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on quantum Fourier transform gates in systems with 2, 3, and 4 qubits, noting a speedup of 80x for evaluating the gradient in the 4-qubit case, highlighting the method's potential for optimizing control pulses in multi-qubit quantum systems.</description>
