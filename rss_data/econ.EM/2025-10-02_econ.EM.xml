      <title>A Unified Framework for Spatial and Temporal Treatment Effect Boundaries: Theory and Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a unified theoretical framework for detecting and estimating boundaries in treatment effects across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We formalize the concept of treatment effect boundaries as structural parameters characterizing regime transitions where causal effects cease to operate. Building on diffusion-based models of information propagation, we establish conditions under which spatial and temporal boundaries share common dynamics, derive identification results, and propose consistent estimators. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance of our methods under various data-generating processes. The framework provides tools for detecting when local treatments become systemic and identifying critical thresholds for policy intervention.</description>

      <title>Generalized Bayes in Conditional Moment Restriction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a generalized (quasi-) Bayes framework for conditional moment restriction models, where the parameter of interest is a nonparametric structural function of endogenous variables. We establish contraction rates for a class of Gaussian process priors and provide conditions under which a Bernstein-von Mises theorem holds for the quasi-Bayes posterior. Consequently, we show that optimally weighted quasi-Bayes credible sets achieve exact asymptotic frequentist coverage, extending classical results for parametric GMM models. As an application, we estimate firm-level production functions using Chilean plant-level data. Simulations illustrate the favorable performance of generalized Bayes estimators relative to common alternatives.</description>

      <title>An alternative bootstrap procedure for factor-augmented regression models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel bootstrap algorithm that is more efficient than existing methods for approximating the distribution of the factor-augmented regression estimator for a rotated parameter vector. The regression is augmented by $r$ factors extracted from a large panel of $N$ variables observed over $T$ time periods. We consider general weak factor (WF) models with $r$ signal eigenvalues that may diverge at different rates, $N^{\alpha _{k}}$, where $0&lt;\alpha _{k}\leq 1$ for $k=1,2,...,r$. We establish the asymptotic validity of our bootstrap method using not only the conventional data-dependent rotation matrix $\hat{\bH}$, but also an alternative data-dependent rotation matrix, $\hat{\bH}_q$, which typically exhibits smaller asymptotic bias and achieves a faster convergence rate. Furthermore, we demonstrate the asymptotic validity of the bootstrap under a purely signal-dependent rotation matrix ${\bH}$, which is unique and can be regarded as the population analogue of both $\hat{\bH}$ and $\hat{\bH}_q$. Experimental results provide compelling evidence that the proposed bootstrap procedure achieves superior performance relative to the existing procedure.</description>

      <title>Estimating Discrete Games of Complete Information: Bringing Logit Back in the Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05002v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating discrete games of complete information is often computationally difficult due to partial identification and the absence of closed-form moment characterizations. This paper proposes computationally tractable approaches to estimation and inference that remove the computational burden associated with equilibria enumeration, numerical simulation, and grid search. Separately for unordered and ordered-actions games, I construct an identified set characterized by a finite set of generalized likelihood-based conditional moment inequalities that are convex in (a subvector of) structural model parameters under the standard logit assumption on unobservables. I use simulation and empirical examples to show that the proposed approaches generate informative identified sets and can be several orders of magnitude faster than existing estimation methods.</description>

      <title>The Local Projection Residual Bootstrap for AR(1) Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01889v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a local projection residual bootstrap method to construct confidence intervals for impulse response coefficients of AR(1) models. Our bootstrap method is based on the local projection (LP) approach and involves a residual bootstrap procedure applied to AR(1) models. We present theoretical results for our bootstrap method and proposed confidence intervals. First, we prove the uniform consistency of the LP-residual bootstrap over a large class of AR(1) models that allow for a unit root, conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form, and martingale difference shocks. Then, we prove the asymptotic validity of our confidence intervals over the same class of AR(1) models. Finally, we show that the LP-residual bootstrap provides asymptotic refinements for confidence intervals on a restricted class of AR(1) models relative to those required for the uniform consistency of our bootstrap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering the heterogeneous effects of particular policies or "treatments" is a key concern for researchers and policymakers. A common approach is to report average treatment effects across subgroups based on observable covariates. However, the choice of subgroups is crucial as it poses the risk of $p$-hacking and requires balancing interpretability with granularity. This paper proposes a nonparametric approach to construct heterogeneous subgroups. The approach enables a flexible exploration of the trade-off between interpretability and the discovery of more granular heterogeneity by constructing a sequence of nested groupings, each with an optimality property. By integrating our approach with "honesty" and debiased machine learning, we provide valid inference about the average treatment effect of each group. We validate the proposed methodology through an empirical Monte-Carlo study and apply it to revisit the impact of maternal smoking on birth weight, revealing systematic heterogeneity driven by parental and birth-related characteristics.</description>

      <title>Minimax and Bayes Optimal Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates minimax and Bayes optimal strategies in fixed-budget best-arm identification. We consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a sampling phase followed by a recommendation phase, and we design an adaptive experiment within this framework to efficiently identify the best arm, defined as the one with the highest expected outcome. In our proposed strategy, the sampling phase consists of two stages. The first stage is a pilot phase, in which we allocate each arm uniformly in equal proportions to eliminate clearly suboptimal arms and estimate outcome variances. In the second stage, arms are allocated in proportion to the variances estimated during the first stage. After the sampling phase, the procedure enters the recommendation phase, where we select the arm with the highest sample mean as our estimate of the best arm. We prove that this single strategy is simultaneously asymptotically minimax and Bayes optimal for the simple regret, with upper bounds that coincide exactly with our lower bounds, including the constant terms.</description>

      <title>Construct to Commitment: The Effect of Narratives on Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how government-led narratives through mass media evolve from construct, a mechanism for framing expectations, into commitment, a sustainable pillar for growth. We propose the "Narratives-Construct-Commitment (NCC)" framework outlining the mechanism and institutionalization of narratives, and formalize it as a dynamic Bayesian game. Using the Innovation-Driven Development Strategy (2016) as a case study, we identify the narrative shock from high-frequency financial data and trace its impact using local projection method. By shaping expectations, credible narratives institutionalize investment incentives, channel resources into R&amp;D, and facilitate sustained improvements in total factor productivity (TFP). Our findings strive to provide insights into the New Quality Productive Forces initiative, highlighting the role of narratives in transforming vision into tangible economic growth.</description>

      <title>Bias Correction in Factor-Augmented Regression Models with Weak Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic bias of the factor-augmented regression estimator and its reduction, which is augmented by the $r$ factors extracted from a large number of $N$ variables with $T$ observations. In particular, we consider general weak latent factor models with $r$ signal eigenvalues that may diverge at different rates, $N^{\alpha _{k}}$, $0&lt;\alpha _{k}\leq 1$, $k=1,\dots,r$. In the existing literature, the bias has been derived using an approximation for the estimated factors with a specific data-dependent rotation matrix $\hat{H}$ for the model with $\alpha_{k}=1$ for all $k$, whereas we derive the bias for weak factor models. In addition, we derive the bias using the approximation with a different rotation matrix $\hat{H}_q$, which generally has a smaller bias than with $\hat{H}$. We also derive the bias using our preferred approximation with a purely signal-dependent rotation $H$, which is unique and can be regarded as the population version of $\hat{H}$ and $\hat{H}_q$. Since this bias is parametrically inestimable, we propose a split-panel jackknife bias correction, and theory shows that it successfully reduces the bias. The extensive finite-sample experiments suggest that the proposed bias correction works very well, and the empirical application illustrates its usefulness in practice.</description>

      <title>Functional Regression with Nonstationarity and Error Contamination: Application to the Economic Impact of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08591v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a regression model with functional dependent and explanatory variables, both of which exhibit nonstationary dynamics. The model assumes that the nonstationary stochastic trends of the dependent variable are explained by those of the explanatory variables, and hence that there exists a stable long-run relationship between the two variables despite their nonstationary behavior. We also assume that the functional observations may be error-contaminated. We develop novel autocovariance-based estimation and inference methods for this model. The methodology is broadly applicable to economic and statistical functional time series with nonstationary dynamics. To illustrate our methodology and its usefulness, we apply it to evaluating the global economic impact of climate change, an issue of intrinsic importance.</description>
