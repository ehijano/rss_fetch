      <title>The $\chi$-binding function of $d$-directional segment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06072v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $d$, the class $d$-DIR is defined as all those intersection graphs formed from a finite collection of line segments in ${\mathbb R}^2$ having at most $d$ slopes. Since each slope induces an interval graph, it easily follows for every $G$ in $d$-DIR with clique number at most $\omega$ that the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of $G$ is at most $d\omega$. We show for every even value of $\omega$ how to construct a graph in $d$-DIR that meets this bound exactly. This partially confirms a conjecture of Bhattacharya, Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Noorizadeh. Furthermore, we show that the $\chi$-binding function of $d$-DIR is $\omega \mapsto d\omega$ for $\omega$ even and $\omega \mapsto d(\omega-1)+1$ for $\omega$ odd. This extends an earlier result by Kostochka and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, which treated the special case $d=2$.</description>

      <title>Completeness Theorems for k-SUM and Geometric Friends: Deciding Fragments of Integer Linear Arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last three decades, the $k$-SUM hypothesis has emerged as a satisfying explanation of long-standing time barriers for a variety of algorithmic problems. Yet to this day, the literature knows of only few proven consequences of a refutation of this hypothesis. Taking a descriptive complexity viewpoint, we ask: What is the largest logically defined class of problems \emph{captured} by the $k$-SUM problem?
  To this end, we introduce a class $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ of problems corresponding to deciding sentences in Presburger arithmetic/linear integer arithmetic over finite subsets of integers.
  We establish two large fragments for which the $k$-SUM problem is complete under fine-grained reductions:
  1. The $k$-SUM problem is complete for deciding the sentences with $k$ existential quantifiers.
  2. The $3$-SUM problem is complete for all $3$-quantifier sentences of $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ expressible using at most $3$ linear inequalities.
  Specifically, a faster-than-$n^{\lceil k/2 \rceil \pm o(1)}$ algorithm for $k$-SUM (or faster-than-$n^{2 \pm o(1)}$ algorithm for $3$-SUM, respectively) directly translate to polynomial speedups of a general algorithm for \emph{all} sentences in the respective fragment.
  Observing a barrier for proving completeness of $3$-SUM for the entire class $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$, we turn to the question which other -- seemingly more general -- problems are complete for $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$. In this direction, we establish $\mathsf{FOP}_{\mathbb{Z}}$-completeness of the \emph{problem pair} of Pareto Sum Verification and Hausdorff Distance under $n$ Translations under the $L_\infty$/$L_1$ norm in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. In particular, our results invite to investigate Pareto Sum Verification as a high-dimensional generalization of 3-SUM.</description>

      <title>Effective Sampling for Robot Motion Planning Through the Lens of Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling-based methods for motion planning, which capture the structure of the robot's free space via (typically random) sampling, have gained popularity due to their scalability, simplicity, and for offering global guarantees, such as probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. Unfortunately, the practicality of those guarantees remains limited as they do not provide insights into the behavior of motion planners for a finite number of samples (i.e., a finite running time). In this work, we harness lattice theory and the concept of $(\delta,\epsilon)$-completeness by Tsao et al. (2020) to construct deterministic sample sets that endow their planners with strong finite-time guarantees while minimizing running time. In particular, we introduce a highly-efficient deterministic sampling approach based on the $A_d^*$ lattice, which is the best-known geometric covering in dimensions $\leq 21$. Using our new sampling approach, we obtain at least an order-of-magnitude speedup over existing deterministic and uniform random sampling methods for complex motion-planning problems. Overall, our work provides deep mathematical insights while advancing the practical applicability of sampling-based motion planning.</description>
