      <title>Grid instability growth rates for explicit, electrostatic momentum- and energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the Debye length is not resolved in a particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation, the plasma will unphysically heat until the Debye length becomes resolved via a phenomenon known as grid heating. The article presents detailed numerical measurements of grid heating for several explicit PIC algorithms including the first systematic (covering the Debye length resolution and drift-velocity parameter space) study of grid-heating growth rates for the standard electrostatic momentum-conserving PIC algorithm. Additionally, we derive and test a cubic-spline-based PIC algorithm that ensures that the interpolated electric field has a continuous first derivative. Also considered are energy-conserving PIC algorithms with linear and quadratic interpolation functions. In all cases, we find that grid heating can occur for for some combinations of Debye under-resolution and plasma drift. We demonstrate analytically and numerically that grid heating cannot be eliminated by using a higher-order field solve, and give an analytical expression for the cold-beam stability limits of some energy-conserving algorithms.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic field solver for QED polarization in super-strong magnetic fields of magnetar and laser plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-strongly magnetized plasmas play a crucial role in extreme environments of magnetar and laboratory laser experiments, demanding comprehensive understanding of how quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects influence plasma behaviour. Earlier analytical and semi-analytical calculations have shown that QED effects can significantly modify the plasma polarization mode behaviour around magnetars using analytical and semi-analytical calculations. In this work, we present the first electromagnetic field solver that is valid beyond the Schwinger limit. QED vacuum polarization in super-strong magnetic fields are modeled with nonlinear Maxwell equations. We show that electromagnetic waves in simulations follow the analytical solutions well and reproduce the birefringence effects of electromagnetic wave modes between the $O$ and $X$ polarizations of perpendicular electromagnetic waves and those between $L$ and $R$ polarizations of parallel waves. This new framework can be applied to kinetic as well as in other types of computer simulations. The solver's key advantage lies in its versatility, allowing it to be used in gyro-motion, gyro-center, and gyro-kinetic simulations, which do not resolve the cyclotron motion, or in plasma studies with ground-level Landau quantization.</description>

      <title>Universal structure of propagation-invariant optical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time structuring of light - where spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are deliberately coupled and controlled - is an emerging area of optics that enables novel configurations of electromagnetic fields. Of particular importance for applications are optical pulses whose peak intensity travels at an arbitrary, tunable velocity while maintaining its spatiotemporal profile. Space-time wave packets and the ideal flying focus are two prominent realizations of these pulses. Here, we show that these realizations share an identical spatiotemporal field structure, and that this structure represents a universal solution for constant-velocity, propagation-invariant pulses.</description>

      <title>Existence and Regularizing Effects of a Nonlinear Diffusion Model for Plasma Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study existence and regularity of weak solutions to a nonlinear parabolic Dirichlet problem $\partial_{t}u - \rho_{\lambda}(x)u\Delta u = \rho_{\lambda}(x)g_{0}(x)u$ on the half line $(0,\infty)$. We find weak solutions from $L^p\ (p &lt; \infty)$ initial data, and by means of a Benilan-Crandall inequality, show solutions are jointly Holder continuous, and locally, spatially Lipschitz on the parabolic interior. We identify special solutions which saturate these bounds. The Benilan-Crandall inequality, derived from time-scaling arguments, is of independent interest for exposing a regularizing effect of the parabolic u$\Delta$u operator. Recently considered in [11], this problem originates in the theory of nonlinear instability damping via wave-particle interactions in plasma physics (see [8, 22]).</description>

      <title>Estimating ionization states and continuum lowering from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations for warm dense hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm dense matter (WDM) is an active field of research, with applications ranging from astrophysics to inertial confinement fusion. Ionization degree and continuum lowering are important quantities to understand how materials behave under these conditions, but can be difficult to diagnose since experimental campaigns are limited and often require model-dependent analysis. This is especially true for hydrogen, which has a comparably low scattering cross section, making high quality data particularly difficult to obtain. Consequently, building equation of state tables often relies on exact simulations in combination with untested approximations to extract properties from experiments. Here, we investigate an approach for extracting the ionization potential depression and ionization degree -- quantities which are otherwise not directly accessible from the physical model -- from exact ab initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations utilizing a chemical model. In contrast to experimental measurements, where noise and non-equilibrium effects add to the uncertainty of the inferred parameters, PIMC simulations provide a clean signal with well-defined thermodynamic conditions. Comparisons against commonly used models show a qualitative agreement, but we find deviations primarily for the high density and high temperature cases. We also demonstrate the decreasing sensitivity of the dynamic structure factor with respect to both ionization and continuum lowering for increasing scattering angles in x-ray Thomson scattering experiments. Our work has important implications for the design of future experiments, but also offers qualitative understanding of structure factors and the imaginary-time correlation function obtained from exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
