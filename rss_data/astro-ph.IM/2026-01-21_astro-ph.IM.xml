      <title>Exoplanet atmospheres and demographics in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct observations of exoplanets probe the demographics and atmospheric composition of young self-luminous companions, yielding insight into their formation and early evolution history. In the near future, Gaia will reveal hundreds of nearby young exoplanets amenable to direct follow-up observations. Long-baseline interferometry with current and future facilities is best capable of exploiting this unique synergy which is poised to deliver a statistical sample of benchmark planets with precise dynamical masses and in-depth atmospheric characterization. This will enable tackling the longstanding question of how giant planets form from multiple angles simultaneously, shining light on the complex physical processes underlying planet formation.</description>

      <title>Habitable Worlds Observatory's Concept and Technology Maturation: Initial Feasibility and Trade Space Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11803v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory is the first telescope ever designed to search for life and will be a powerhouse of discovery across topics in astrophysics. The observatory was the top recommendation of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey for large missions and a new HWO Technology Maturation Project Office was formed in August 2024 to mature the architecture, science and technology. In this paper we review the overall approach taken to mature the mission concept. We show progress on architecture development, integrated modeling, science cases, and technology roadmaps consistent with pre-formulation studies. We discuss plans for instrument studies and international engagement and science engagement including a Community Science and Instrument Team. Finally, we describe the plan forward to the Mission Concept Review.</description>

      <title>Template-free search for gravitational wave events using coincident anomaly detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have used template-based search to detect hundreds of compact binary coalescences (CBCs). However, template-based search cannot detect astrophysical sources that lack accurate waveform models, including core-collapse supernovae, neutron star glitches, and cosmic strings. Here, we present a novel approach for template-free search using coincident anomaly detection (CoAD). CoAD requires neither labeled training examples nor background-only training sets, instead exploiting the coincidence of events across spatially separated detectors as the training loss itself: two neural networks independently analyze data from each detector and are trained to maximize coincident predictions. Additionally, we show that integrated gradient analysis can localize GW signals from the neural-network weights, providing a path toward data-driven template construction of unmodeled sources, and further improving precision by frequency matching. Using the CodaBench dataset of real LIGO backgrounds with injected simulated CBCs and sine-Gaussian low-frequency bursts, CoAD achieves recall up to 0.91 and 0.85 respectively at a false-alarm rate of one event per year, and achieves recall above 0.5 at signal-to-noise ratios below 10. The fully-unsupervised nature of CoAD makes it especially well-suited for next-generation detectors with greater sensitivity and associated increases in GW event rates.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Next Galactic Supernova with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernovae are observed to occur approximately 1-2 times per century in a galaxy like the Milky Way. Based on historical records, however, the last core-collapse galactic supernova observed by humans occurred almost 1,000 years ago. Luckily, we are well positioned to catch the next one with the advent of new neutrino detectors and astronomical observatories. Neutrino observatories can provide unprecedented triggers for a galactic supernova event as they are likely to see a supernova neutrino signal anywhere from minutes to days before the shock breakout causes the supernova to brighten in optical wavelengths. Given its large etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ideally positioned to rapidly localize the optical counterpart based on the neutrino trigger. In this paper we simulate events to study the efficiency with which supernovae are optimally localized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We find that the observatory is ideal for initial localization of nearly all observable supernova triggers and has a 57-97% chance of catching any supernova based on theoretical stellar mass density predictions and observations. We provide an analysis of optimal filter selection and exposure times and discuss observational caveats.</description>

      <title>PyIRD: A Python-Based Data Reduction Pipeline for Subaru/IRD and REACH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PyIRD is a Python-based pipeline for reducing spectroscopic data obtained with IRD (InfraRed Doppler; Kotani et al. (2018)) and REACH (Rigorous Exoplanetary Atmosphere Characterization with High dispersion coronagraphy; Kotani et al. (2020)) on the Subaru Telescope. It is designed to process raw images into one-dimensional spectra in a semi-automatic manner. Unlike traditional methods, it does not rely on IRAF (Tody, 1986; 1993), a software used for astronomical data reduction. This approach simplifies the workflow while maintaining efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the pipeline includes an updated method for removing readout noise patterns from raw images, enabling efficient extraction of spectra even for faint targets such as brown dwarfs.
  The code is open source and available at https://github.com/prvjapan/pyird .</description>

      <title>Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope: Early Data Release of observations in the 1.4 {\mu}m water-vapor-absorption band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-based observations around 1.4 $\mu$m are normally limited by strong absorption of telluric water-vapor. However, Dome A, Antarctica has exceptionally dry conditions that offer a unique opportunity for observations in this band. We designed a new filter covering 1.34--1.48 $\mu$m, namely $W'$, and installed it on the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) at Dome A in 2025. AIRBT comprises two identical 15 cm optical tube assemblies and two InGaAs cameras equipped with $J$ and $W'$ filters, respectively. With this Early Data Release (EDR), we aim to evaluate the performance of the $W'$ band at Dome A to observe objects with water-vapor features. This EDR covers $\thicksim 20 \ \mathrm{deg^2}$ in the Galactic plane using $\thicksim 20,000$ images in three nights. For 2 s exposures, the 5 $\sigma$ limiting magnitude histogram peaks at $J \thicksim 11.5$ mag (Vega) and $W' \thicksim 9.9$ mag, respectively. The $J-W'$ vs $J-H$ color-color diagram distinguishes ultracool candidates with water-vapor-absorption features from reddened early type stars. Furthermore, later-type stars tend to exhibit stronger water-vapor absorption. Some sources show larger $\Delta W'$ than $\Delta J$ across the three nights, which we attribute to variations of their water-vapor-absorption depth. We conclude that it will be efficient to search for ultracool stars and estimate their spectral subtypes using $W'$ band imaging at Dome A, where the atmospheric transmission is high and stable.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical design of the DragonCam microscopic camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DragonCam Microscopic Camera is an instrument being developed for NASA's Dragonfly mission [1] to Saturn's moon Titan. The Microscopic Camera will be body-fixed to the Dragonfly vehicle and will image the surface at a distance of about one meter (98.6 cm nominal) with a pixel scale of better than 60 microns/pixel and a nominal 52 degree angle to the Titan surface. With the 4.8 um pixel pitch of the sensor, this is a focal length of about 77.5 mm. To accommodate range variations due to vehicle pose and surface topography, the Microscopic Camera has a focus mechanism to give it a depth of field (DOF) of about 130mm. Since the Microscopic Camera's boresight is tilted by 52{\deg} off the vertical, the optical configuration has a compensating tilted focal plane, taking advantage of the Scheimpflug imaging principle. The optics are all-refractive with nine elements, a six-element stationary group and a three-element moving group. A plano-plano window seals the optics from the environment and also serves as the substrate for a bandpass filter. The optomechanical system is derived from the Mars Hand Lens Imager [11]; the moving group is mounted to a linear slide which is translated via a cam follower by the rotation of a cam driven by a stepper motor. The Microscopic Camera is designed to survive at temperatures as low as -130C without power. The camera is enclosed in a cavity in the foam insulation covering the spacecraft and looking through a single-pane window. Prior to imaging, the camera will be heated to operating temperature (nominal -30C) for proper actuation of the mechanism. STOP analysis has been performed to demonstrate that optical performance is maintained after heating. Software focus merging will be performed in the onboard camera control electronics to minimize image data downlink requirements.</description>

      <title>A dual tunnel structure for the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel tunnel architecture for the Einstein Telescope that departs from the traditional large-cavern approach and reduces the excavated volume by an order of magnitude. In the proposed design, all seismic isolation systems are housed in raise-bore wells drilled upward from the main tunnel toward an upper service tunnel. The pre-isolators for the most sensitive optics are located in the service tunnel, seating directly on strong and compact rock, while the other filters are distributed along the wells within compact, side-access vacuum chambers. Shorter, separate wells accommodate the seismic isolation systems for less demanding optics. This configuration provides substantial advantages: easier lock acquisition and improved robustness of the interferometers, lower-frequency pendulum stages, reduced congestion around the test masses, simplified installation and maintenance, improved vacuum partitioning, strong physical decoupling between the high- and low-frequency interferometers, and enhanced compatibility with future advances of Newtonian-noise cancellation. A novel technique for real-time, precision monitoring of rock motion and tilt provides a new signal for Newtonian noise cancellation and enables correction of seismic disturbances even during earthquakes, offering unique geophysical measurement capabilities.</description>

      <title>Observations with the Southern Connecticut Stellar Interferometer. II. First Three-Telescope Observations and a New Diameter Measurement of Arcturus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the most recent observations made with the Southern Connecticut Stellar Interferometer (SCSI), which is a three-station stellar intensity interferometer located on the campus of Southern Connecticut State University, in New Haven, Connecticut. Two different kinds of observations are presented. We first analyze observations of Vega taken in a three-telescope mode. (Previously, the instrument had only two operational stations.) We show that, while the efficiency remains nearly identical to that reported in our last paper, the addition of the third station allows more photon data to be recorded simultaneously, and therefore we can build up the photon-bunching peak in the data stream in fewer hours on sky for an unresolved source. In the second part of the paper, we report our observations to date of the nearby red giant star, Arcturus, most of which occurred in the first half of 2025. These show that, as a partially resolved source at the baselines we used, we detect fewercorrelations in the photon-bunching peak than for an unresolved source of comparable brightness. Combining the data with speckle imaging observations taken at Apache Point Observatory, we derive a new measurement of Arcturus' diameter that extends the time baseline of interferometric observations of the star and is consistent with previous analyses made by other investigators.</description>

      <title>The R2Pub Telescopes for Surveying: An Overview and Performance Evaluation of the System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R2Pub telescope, built by the Beijing Planetarium, is a 60 cm equatorial binocular telescope located at the Daocheng site of Yunnan Observatories in China, at an altitude of about 4700 m. This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution.</description>

      <title>Prospecting MeerKAT Continuum Data for Enigmatic Radio Sources with Unsupervised Vector-Quantised Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of Vector quantised variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to deep 1.28 GHz radio continuum images taken from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS).VQ-VAEs are deep learning models widely used in modern computer vision applications and pipelines. Designed for image generation, VQ-VAEs are trained to reconstruct the input dataset via a low-dimensional discrete embedding. VQ-VAEs effectively learn the distribution of training data, where samples that do not fit the distribution well yield the highest reconstruction errors. This property makes VQ-VAEs a good candidate for the task of anomaly detection. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of VQ-VAEs in identifying radio continuum sources with anomalous structures in the image-plane domain. We find VQ-VAEs to be useful as part of a solution for searching such large datasets. We observe that they are able to remove a majority of the typical sources in such data, even when trained in an unsupervised manner on unlabelled data. We also provide our testing set of a large sample of manually labelled radio sources, in particular radio galaxies, taken from the MGCLS at 1.28 GHz. Automated approaches to searching through high volumes of data are key in extracting the full scientific potential of the Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders.</description>

      <title>Optimising gravitational-wave sky maps for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently reported compelling evidence for the presence of a gravitational-wave background signal. Mapping the gravitational-wave background is key to understanding how it is formed, since anisotropy is a tracer for, for example, a supermassive black hole binary origin. In this work we refine the frequentist regularised gravitational-wave mapping analysis developed in our previous work (as part of the MeerKAT PTA 4.5-year data release). We derive a point-spread function describing the angular resolution of a PTA. We investigate how the point spread function changes for different PTA constellations and determine the best possible angular resolution achievable within our framework. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that previous methods do not capture the actual resolution - especially in regions of the sky with a high density of pulsars. We propose an improved scheme that accounts for a variable local resolution and test it using realistic simulations of the latest MeerKAT dataset. We demonstrate that we are able to identify a continuous gravitational wave signal in a region with good pulsar sky coverage with approximately a factor of two increase in significance compared to our previous method.</description>

      <title>Opportunities in AI/ML for the Rubin LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.</description>

      <title>Inferring hemispheric asymmetries of stellar active regions through the information content of astrometric signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photometric light curves suffer from fundamental degeneracies that limit surface information recovery. We demonstrate that astrometry enables access to complementary information through photocentre variations induced by rotating surface features. The forthcoming commissioning of microarcsecond-precision astrometric missions presents an opportunity to improve stellar surface mapping. This paper extends a previous theoretical framework for stellar surface mapping, along three primary directions: (1) we derive analytical selection rules showing that astrometry is sensitive to spherical harmonic modes not detectable via photometry, particularly odd-$\ell$ modes that encode north-south asymmetries; (2) we quantify the information content of combined photometric and astrometric observations, showing that the rank of observable modes grows faster for combined observations than for either technique alone, though the fraction of recoverable modes still decreases asymptotically with increasing spatial resolution; and (3) we reframe astrometric jitter-traditionally treated as noise in exoplanet studies-as a signal encoding stellar surface structure. Given the limited proposed target lists of high-precision astrometric missions, this capability is particularly valuable: understanding host star surfaces is crucial for both removing stellar signals from exoplanet detections and characterising star-planet interactions. We show that while Sun-like stars require sub-microarcsecond precision, evolved stars with angular diameter and larger spots present immediate opportunities with current technology, such as the Gaia mission.</description>

      <title>Using Astrometry to Break Degeneracies in Stellar Surface Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric jitter noise arises when starspots on a rotating stellar surface move in and out of view, shifting the photocenter. This noise may limit our ability to detect and weigh small, sub-Neptune-sized planets around active stars. By deriving a linear forward model for the astrometric jitter signal of a rotating star in a spherical-harmonic coordinate system, we show that jitter noise can be used to reconstruct surface-brightness maps and, in principle, disentangle jitter from stellar reflex motion due to an orbiting planet. Furthermore, we show that astrometry and photometry probe complementary surface information: photometry measures even-degree spherical harmonic surfaces that are symmetric about the equator, while astrometry measures odd-degree modes. Their joint use, therefore, breaks degeneracies in surface mapping. Our model further quantifies the variation in the astrometric signal with inclination angle, which is foundational for studies of worst-case configurations of astrometric star-spot noise. For example, we show that pole-on stellar inclinations lead to poorly constrained inversions, as any stellar surface produces a purely circular astrometric jitter signal. We characterize the degeneracy in jointly identifying the stellar surface and stellar inclination, and develop a surface estimation approach. Using this approach, we present example simulations and reconstructions that demonstrate the use of astrometry data alongside light-curve data to improve stellar surface mapping and localize spot positions in latitude and longitude. With forthcoming high-precision Gaia astrometry, astrometric surface mapping provides a promising new approach to probe stellar activity.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids Flybys Using Multiple Venus Gravity Assists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops low-energy spacecraft (SC) trajectories using Venus gravity assists to study asteroids during heliocentric transfer segments between planetary encounters. The study focuses on potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as primary exploration targets. This paper proposes a method for calculating SC trajectories that enable asteroid flybys after a Venus gravity assist. The method involves formulating and solving an optimization problem to design trajectories incorporating flybys of selected asteroids and Venus. Trajectories are calculated using two-body dynamics by solving the Lambert problem. A preliminary search for candidate asteroids uses an algorithm to narrow the search space of the optimization problem. This algorithm uses the V-infinity globe technique to connect planetary gravity assists with resonant orbits. The resonant orbit in this case serves as an initial approximation for the SC's trajectory between two successive planetary flybys. Four flight schemes were analyzed, including multiple flybys of Venus and asteroids, with the possibility of an SC returning to Earth. The proposed solutions reduce flight time between asteroid approaches, increase gravity assist frequency, and enhance mission design flexibility. The use of Venus gravity assists and resonant orbits ensures a close encounter with at least one asteroid during the SC's trajectory between two consecutive flybys of Venus, and demonstrates the feasibility of periodic Venus gravity assists and encounters with PHAs. The developed method was applied to construct trajectories that allow an SC to approach both Venus-resonant asteroids and PHAs via multiple Venus gravity assists. An additional study was carried out to identify asteroids accessible during the Earth-Venus segment in launch windows between 2029 and 2050.</description>

      <title>Identification of false positive double-lined spectroscopic binaries in LAMOST-MRS data due to moonlight contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for identifying false positive double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) candidates by analysing medium-resolution survey spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR10. Specifically, we focus on spectra contaminated by moonlight, which exhibit near-zero radial velocity (RV) and solar-like spectral lines from the secondary component. By applying strict constraints on the contamination parameters and fitting the contaminated spectra, we ultimately confirmed that 126 false positive binaries are single stars contaminated by moonlight. Additionally, we identify several key factors contributing to moonlight contamination: the lunar phase during observation, the G-band magnitude of the star, and the angular distance between the star and the moon. Notably, artificial satellites in low-orbital can also introduce contamination from solar-like spectral components, but they typically display significantly higher transverse velocities. In a follow-up study, we will expand our analysis to identify additional false positive SB2 systems and systematically classify them according to their contamination sources.</description>

      <title>Lessons Learned from Structural Design and Vibration Testing of 50-kg Microsatellites Deployed from the International Space Station</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hokkaido University and Tohoku University have been developing and operating a constellation of 50-cm-class microsatellites for Earth observation. DIWATA-1, launched in 2016, was deployed into a circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 400 km from the International Space Station (ISS). For the subsequent satellite developed in 2021, the structural design and vibration test campaign were optimized to meet a strict one-year development schedule. This paper summarizes how the structural design of the previous satellite was reviewed and updated, and how the vibration test was successfully completed in a single trial to minimize schedule and technical risks. These lessons learned provide valuable insights, as there are only a limited number of reported cases of 50-kg-class microsatellites deployed from the ISS.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes the system design methodology derived from the development and evaluation tests of deployable solar panels to be mounted on a 3U CubeSat. The study mainly includes structural analysis, thermal analysis, and a review of vibration test results. Hokkaido University is developing the 3U CubeSat HOKUSHIN-1 in collaboration with Tohoku University and Muroran Institute of Technology. Deployable solar panels are a key technology for future planned lunar exploration missions, as they enable power-intensive communication and propulsion required for orbit control. The satellite also demonstrates a newly developed compact and efficient propulsion system. The satellite has dimensions of approximately 10x10x34 cm, a mass of 3.99 kg, and will be deployed into a circular orbit at an altitude of about 400 km with an orbital inclination of 51.6 degrees from the International Space Station.</description>

Abstract: Since the launch of its first satellite in 2009, Tohoku University has continuously developed and operated Earth observation satellites and engineering demonstration satellites in the 50cm-class and CubeSat-class (up to 3U). The 50cm-class satellite launched into operation in 2021 enabled efficient operations through cloud-based management functions for both the satellite and ground stations, including automatic command generation. By 2022, up to eight operational satellites were simultaneously managed on a daily basis using three ground stations (Sendai, Hakodate, and Sweden). This paper presents the operational achievements to date and introduces the system that supports efficient satellite operations</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Modelling of Black Hole Binary Evolution with Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) can detect the low-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) generated by an ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs). Accurate determination of BHB merger timescales is essential for interpreting GWBs and constraining key astrophysical quantities such as black hole (BH) occupation fractions and galaxy coalescence rates. High-accuracy $N$-body codes such as \texttt{Griffin} can resolve sub-pc BHB dynamics but are too costly to explore a wide range of initial conditions, motivating the need for surrogate models that emulate their long-term evolution at much lower computational cost. We investigate neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) as surrogates for the secular orbital evolution of BHBs. Our primary contribution is a parameterised NODE (PNODE) trained on an ensemble of $N$-body simulations of galaxy mergers spanning a two-dimensional parameter space defined by the initial orbital eccentricity and particle resolution $(e_i, N)$, with the learned vector field explicitly conditioned on these parameters. A single PNODE thereby learns a simulation-parameter-conditioned dynamical model for the coupled evolution of the BH pair's orbital state across the ensemble, yielding smooth trajectories from which stable hardening and eccentricity growth rates can be extracted. The PNODE accurately reproduces the secular evolution of the specific orbital energy and angular momentum, and the corresponding Keplerian orbital elements, for held-out trajectories, with modest generalisation to a partially unseen high-resolution case. Combining PNODE predictions with semi-analytical prescriptions for stellar hardening and gravitational-wave emission yields BHB merger timescales consistent with those obtained from direct $N$-body inputs within current theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Testing the Physical Parameter Constraining Power of HCN and HNC with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the utility of HCN and HNC to characterize gas conditions in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We use measurements from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program ALCHEMI: the ALMA Comprehensive High-resolution Molecular Inventory. Using different subsets of the eight total HCN and HNC transitions measured by ALCHEMI, we test the number and combinations of transitions necessary for constraining the temperature, H$_2$ volume and column densities, cosmic-ray ionization rate, and beam-filling factor in three representative regions within NGC 253. We use these combinations of HCN and HNC transitions to constrain chemical and radiative transfer models and infer the gas conditions using a Bayesian nested sampling algorithm combined with neural network models for increased efficiency. By comparing the shapes of the resulting posterior distributions, as well as the medians and uncertainties for each gas parameter, from each test case to what we obtain with the full set of eight transitions (the control), we quantify how well each test reproduces the control. We find that multiple transitions each of both molecules are required to obtain a median parameter value within a factor of 2 of the control with an uncertainty less than 2-3 times that of the control. We also find that transition combinations that feature a range of upper-state energies are most effective. We show that single transitions, such as HCN J = 1-0 or 3-2, are among the worst-performing combinations and result in parameter values up to an order of magnitude different than the control.</description>

      <title>Variability as a new discovery channel for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in the Time Domain Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Between the groundbreaking detections of stellar-mass black holes by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and JWST's revelation of a surprisingly abundant population of supermassive black holes, one crucial missing link remains: the elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). IMBHs represent a key phase in the hierarchical growth of black holes, yet they have persistently evaded detection. Traditional methods, effective for both actively accreting and quiescent black holes, have largely failed to uncover this hidden population. Here, we argue that novel observational strategies--particularly time-domain variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and tidal disruption events--provide a promising path forward. Finding IMBHs will resolve critical gaps in our understanding of black hole formation and the various mechanisms driving their subsequent growth. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, with its unprecedented capacity to monitor the dynamic sky, stands to revolutionize our ability to detect these long-sought IMBHs, shedding new light on the assembly history of black holes across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>The ESA Meerkat Asteroid Guard: a monitoring service for imminent impactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Meerkat Asteroid Guard, an imminent impactor warning service developed and maintained by the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC). The software uses the method of systematic ranging to perform orbit determination on tracklets in the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), which typically have short observational arcs. Fitted orbits are propagated to determine the likelihood of an impact with Earth. In addition, magnitude fitting and Monte Carlo sampling are performed to estimate the object's size, possible impact locations and times, and suggest a best telescope pointing for object follow-up. A set of object scores are produced from computed posterior probabilities across the grid, giving a statistical description of the object's orbital and physical characteristics. The scores are packaged with several informative plots in an email alert, which is sent to Meerkat subscribers in the event of a significant impact probability, close approach, or other scientifically interesting event. The highlights of the five years of Meerkat's operational service are presented, including the successful warnings for all of the past six imminent impactors discovered before impact and several interesting close approaches.</description>

      <title>AMACA: Astronomy education with a Multi-sensory, Accessible, and Circular Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AMACA project (Astronomy education with a Multi-sensory, Accessible, and Circular Approach) develops multi-sensory activities for accessible education and engagement in astronomy. Despite promising innovations, existing resources are often poorly documented, designed for one-time events, expensive, and lack interdisciplinary collaboration, user testing, and broad dissemination. AMACA addresses these challenges by creating multi-sensory activities for education and outreach, with a particular focus on accessibility for people with sensory disabilities. A circular approach informs its educational structure: (1) a PhD course on multi-sensory astronomy outreach develops hands-on activities with the support of astronomers, psychologists, and organizations for the visually impaired and the deaf; (2) PhD candidates teach High School (HS) students how to deliver the activities; (3) HS students lead the activities at the Astronomy Festival "The Universe in All Senses"; (4) HS students train teachers to implement the activities in their classrooms. AMACA also develops tools to guide project development and track participants' learning. Key findings show improved communication and accessibility awareness among PhD candidates, increased emotional engagement with astronomy among HS students, enhanced public engagement with research and accessibility awareness, and high teacher satisfaction with the flipped-roles, hands-on approach. Overall, AMACA enhances accessibility and engagement in astronomy education across audiences.</description>

Abstract: In Very-Long Baseline Interferometric arrays, nearly co-located stations probe the largest scales and typically cannot resolve the observed source. In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</description>

      <title>AAFIYA: Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents AAFIYA (Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment), a modular Python toolkit for automated characterization of radio-frequency antennas using measurement and simulation data. The toolkit provides a unified workflow for processing S-parameters, impedance, realized gain, beam patterns, polarization metrics, and calibration-based yield estimation, with support for standard Touchstone files and beam pattern data. AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle. The results demonstrate that AAFIYA enables accurate, reproducible, and publication-ready antenna analysis, and provides a flexible foundation for future extensions, including automated optimization and data-driven antenna design.</description>

      <title>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) II. The radial structure of debris discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) was recently completed to cover the lack of high-resolution observations of debris discs and to investigate the prevalence of substructures such as radial gaps and rings in a sample of 24 discs. This study characterises the radial structure of debris discs in the ARKS programme. To identify and quantify the disc substructures, we modelled all discs with a range of non-parametric and parametric approaches. We find that of the 24 discs in the sample, 5 host multiple rings, 7 are single rings that display halos or additional low-amplitude rings, and 12 are single rings with at most tentative evidence of additional substructures. The fractional ring widths that we measured are significantly narrower than previously derived values, and they follow a distribution similar to the fractional widths of individual rings resolved in protoplanetary discs. However, there exists a population of rings in debris discs that are significantly wider than those in protoplanetary discs. We also find that discs with steep inner edges consistent with planet sculpting tend to be found at smaller (&lt;100 au) radii, while more radially extended discs tend to have shallower edges more consistent with collisional evolution. An overwhelming majority of discs have radial profiles well-described by either a double power law or double-Gaussian parametrisation. While our findings suggest that it may be possible for some debris discs to inherit their structures directly from protoplanetary discs, there exists a sizeable population of broad debris discs that cannot be explained in this way. Assuming that the distribution of millimetre dust reflects the distribution of planetesimals, mechanisms that cause rings in protoplanetary discs to migrate or debris discs to broaden soon after formation may be at play, possibly mediated by planetary migration or scattering.</description>

      <title>RNLE: Residual neural likelihood estimation and its application to gravitational-wave astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for Bayesian inference when the likelihood is analytically intractable or computationally prohibitive. By leveraging machine-learning techniques and neural density estimators, it enables flexible likelihood or posterior modeling directly from simulations. We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets. We further assess the stability of the method by quantifying the variability introduced by retraining the conditional density estimator on statistically identical datasets with different optimization seeds, referred to as training noise. This variability can be mitigated through an ensemble approach that combines multiple RNLE models using evidence-based weighting. An implementation of RNLE is publicly available in the sbilby package, enabling its deployment within gravitational-wave astronomy and a broad range of scientific applications requiring flexible, simulation-based likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating state-of-the-art cloud quantum computers for quantum neural networks in gravitational waves data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers provided for usage in cloud by big companies (such as IBM, IonQ, IQM Quantum Computers, etc.) to run our quantum neural network (QNN) developed for data analysis in the context of LISA Space Mission, developed with the Qiskit library in Python. Our previous work demonstrated that our QNN learns patterns in gravitational wave (GW) data much faster than a classical neural network, making it suitable for fast GW signal detection in future LISA data streams. Analyzing the fees from hardware providers like IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket and Microsoft Azure, we found that the fees for running the first segment of our QNN sum up to \$2000, \$60000, and \$1000000 respectively. Using free plans, we succeed to run the 3-qubit feature map of the QNN for one random data sample on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto} and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont IQM Quantum Computers\_Garnet} quantum computers, obtaining a fidelity of 99\%; we could also run the first prediction segment of our QNN on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto}, implemented for 4 qubits, and obtained a prediction accuracy of 20\%. We queried providers such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, Pasqal, and Munich Quantum Valley to obtain access to their plans, but, with the exception of Amazon Braket, our applications remain unanswered to this day. Other major setbacks in using the quantum computers we had access to included Qiskit library version issues (as in the cases of IBM Quantum and IQM Quantum Computers) and the frequent unavailability of the devices, as was the case with the Microsoft Azure provider. All the results presented in this paper were accumulated in 2024.</description>

Abstract: Detecting small planets via the radial velocity method remains challenged by signals induced by stellar variability, versus the effects of the planet(s). Here, we explore using Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry in modeling radial velocities (RVs) to help to mitigate stellar jitter from oscillations and granulation for exoplanet detection. We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\star=1.09M_{\odot}$, $R_\star=1.88R_{\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD~5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset. For long baseline and high-cadence RV observations, GP regression can effectively mitigate stellar jitter without photometric data. However, for intermittent RV observations, incorporating photometric data improves GP fitting and enhances detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Pre-computed aerosol extinction, scattering and asymmetry grids for scalable atmospheric retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) permits to measure the absorption features of a wide range of condensate species from Silicates to Titan tholins. Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget. The Qext, Qscat and g grids are freely available on Zenodo as well as a public TauREx plugin -TauREx-PCQ- that utilize them.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with deep ensembles: Evaluating calibration uncertainty and detecting model misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.</description>

      <title>An Improved Machine Learning Approach for Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation in FAST-SETI Survey Archival Data</title>

Abstract: The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) commensal surveys aim to scan the sky to detect technosignatures from extraterrestrial life. A major challenge in SETI is the effective mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI), a critical step that is particularly vital for the highly sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). While initial RFI mitigation (e.g., removal of persistent and drifting narrowband RFI) are essential, residual RFI often persists, posing significant challenges due to its complex and various nature. In this paper, we propose and apply an improved machine learning approach, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, to identify and mitigate residual RFI in FAST-SETI commensal survey archival data from July 2019. After initial RFI mitigation, we successfully identify and remove 36977 residual RFIs (accounting for $\sim$ 77.87\%) within approximately 1.678 seconds using the DBSCAN algorithm. This result shows that we have achieved a 7.44\% higher removal rate than previous machine learning methods, along with a 24.85\% reduction in execution time. We finally find interesting candidate signals consistent with previous studies, and retain one candidate signal following further analysis. Therefore, DBSCAN algorithm can mitigate more residual RFI with higher computational efficiency while preserving the candidate signals that we are interested in.</description>

      <title>Using 23 Years of ACS/SBC Data to Understand Backgrounds: Explaining &amp; Predicting Background Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light (ZL) model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is inspired by the original DIRBE model by Kelsall et al. (K98), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 3\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 ZL Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 30$ kJy/sr at 1.25--3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. At high Galactic latitudes, the total RMS of each DR2 map is lower than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA map of $\sim$ 80 \% at wavelengths 4.9--25 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.

      <title>Impact of multi-messenger spectral modelling on blazar-neutrino associations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blazars are interesting source candidates for astrophysical neutrino emission. Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra (''p-gamma spectra'') which are typically strongly peaked at PeV energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and high-energy neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on recent predictions for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been found to be spatially close to high-energy events detected by IceCube. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available muon track IceCube data aimed at point source searches, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability $P_\mathrm{assoc} &gt; 0.5$ to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.</description>

      <title>Discrete Chi-Square Method can model and forecast complex time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01540v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how intensive, large and accurate time series can allow us to see through time. Many phenomena have aperiodic and periodic components. An ideal time series analysis method would detect such trend and signal(-s) combinations. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations constraining the trend and signal(-s) detection. We show that none of those limitations constrains our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) which can detect signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): ``For any sample window $\Delta T$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $\sigma$ increase.'' The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The DCM can forecast complex time series. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test. Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series.</description>

      <title>Automating Sensor Characterization with Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor characterization that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.</description>

      <title>Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. To constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods and investigate the sensitivity of APPA using two complementary approaches: Likelihood analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for the axion mass range of $10^{-22}-10^{-18}$ eV, APPA yields a tighter upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations, while also achieving superior detection sensitivity. Moreover, a larger spatial distribution scale of the satellite network corresponds to a greater advantage in detecting axions with lighter masses.</description>

      <title>Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects.
  From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits.
  Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey.
  We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.</description>

      <title>JWST COMPASS: Insights into the Systematic Noise Properties of NIRSpec/G395H From a Uniform Reanalysis of Seven Transmission Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\% larger in NRS1 and 12\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.</description>

      <title>DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</description>
