      <title>A Survey on Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many complex real-world systems exhibit inherently intertwined temporal and spatial characteristics. Spatio-temporal knowledge graphs (STKGs) have therefore emerged as a powerful representation paradigm, as they integrate entities, relationships, time and space within a unified graph structure. They are increasingly applied across diverse domains, including environmental systems and urban, transportation, social and human mobility networks. However, modeling STKGs remains challenging: their foundations span classical graph theory as well as temporal and spatial graph models, which have evolved independently across different research communities and follow heterogeneous modeling assumptions and terminologies. As a result, existing approaches often lack conceptual alignment, generalizability and reusability. This survey provides a systematic review of spatio-temporal knowledge graph models, tracing their origins in static, temporal and spatial graph modeling. We analyze existing approaches along key modeling dimensions, including edge semantics, temporal and spatial annotation strategies, temporal and spatial semantics and relate these choices to their respective application domains. Our analysis reveals that unified modeling frameworks are largely absent and that most current models are tailored to specific use cases rather than designed for reuse or long-term knowledge preservation. Based on these findings, we derive modeling guidelines and identify open challenges to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Social Story Frames: Contextual Reasoning about Narrative Intent and Reception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reading stories evokes rich interpretive, affective, and evaluative responses, such as inferences about narrative intent or judgments about characters. Yet, computational models of reader response are limited, preventing nuanced analyses. To address this gap, we introduce SocialStoryFrames, a formalism for distilling plausible inferences about reader response, such as perceived author intent, explanatory and predictive reasoning, affective responses, and value judgments, using conversational context and a taxonomy grounded in narrative theory, linguistic pragmatics, and psychology. We develop two models, SSF-Generator and SSF-Classifier, validated through human surveys (N=382 participants) and expert annotations, respectively. We conduct pilot analyses to showcase the utility of the formalism for studying storytelling at scale. Specifically, applying our models to SSF-Corpus, a curated dataset of 6,140 social media stories from diverse contexts, we characterize the frequency and interdependence of storytelling intents, and we compare and contrast narrative practices (and their diversity) across communities. By linking fine-grained, context-sensitive modeling with a generic taxonomy of reader responses, SocialStoryFrames enable new research into storytelling in online communities.</description>

      <title>LitFM: A Retrieval Augmented Structure-aware Foundation Model For Citation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), managing scientific literature via LLMs has become a promising direction of research. However, existing approaches often overlook the rich structural and semantic relevance among scientific literature, limiting their ability to discern the relationships between pieces of scientific knowledge, and suffer from various types of hallucinations. These methods also focus narrowly on individual downstream tasks, limiting their applicability across use cases. Here we propose LitFM, the first literature foundation model designed for a wide variety of practical downstream tasks on domain-specific literature, with a focus on citation information. At its core, LitFM contains a novel graph retriever to integrate graph structure by navigating citation graphs and extracting relevant literature, thereby enhancing model reliability. LitFM also leverages a knowledge-infused LLM, fine-tuned through a well-developed instruction paradigm. It enables LitFM to extract domain-specific knowledge from literature and reason relationships among them. By integrating citation graphs during both training and inference, LitFM can generalize to unseen papers and accurately assess their relevance within existing literature. Additionally, we introduce new large-scale literature citation benchmark datasets on three academic fields, featuring sentence-level citation information and local context. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of LitFM, achieving 28.1% improvement on retrieval task in precision, and an average improvement of 7.52% over state-of-the-art across six downstream literature-related tasks</description>

      <title>WorldMove, a global open data for human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality human mobility data is crucial for applications such as urban planning, transportation management, and public health, yet its collection is often hindered by privacy concerns and data scarcity-particularly in less-developed regions. To address this challenge, we introduce WorldMove, a large-scale synthetic mobility dataset covering over 1,600 cities across 179 countries and 6 continents. Our method leverages publicly available multi-source data, including gridded population distribution, point-of-interest (POI) maps, and commuting origin-destination (OD) flows-to generate realistic city-scale mobility trajectories using a diffusion-based generative model. The generation process involves defining city boundaries, collecting multi-source input features, and simulating individual-level movements that reflect plausible daily mobility behavior. Comprehensive validation demonstrates that the generated data closely aligns with real-world observations, both in terms of fine-grained individual mobility behavior and city-scale population flows. Alongside the pre-generated datasets, we release the trained model and a complete open-source pipeline, enabling researchers and practitioners to generate custom synthetic mobility data for any city worldwide. This work not only fills critical data gaps, but also lays a global foundation for scalable, privacy-preserving, and inclusive mobility research-empowering data-scarce regions and enabling universal access to human mobility insights.</description>

      <title>When Small Acts Scale: Ethical Thresholds in Network Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much ethical evaluation treats actions dyadically: one agent acts on one recipient. In networked, platform-mediated environments, this lens misses how public acts diffuse. We introduce a minimal message-passing model in which an initiating act with baseline valence w spreads across a social graph with exposure b, per-hop salience $alpha$, compliance $q$, and depth (horizon) d. The model yields a closed-form \emph{network multiplier} relative to the dyadic baseline and identifies a threshold at r=b.alpha.q=1 separating subcritical (saturating), critical (linear), and supercritical (geometric) regimes. We show how common platform design levers -- reach and fan-out (affecting b), ranking and context (affecting alpha), share mechanics and friction (affecting q), and time-bounds (affecting d) -- systematically change expected downstream responsibility Applications include pandemic mitigation and vaccination externalities, as well as platform amplification of prosocial and harmful norms.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fake-News Detection with Node-Level Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news has posed serious threats to individuals and society, spurring intense research into automated detection methods. Previous work showed that integrating content, user preferences, and propagation structure achieves strong performance, but leaves all graph-level representation learning entirely to the GNN, hiding any explicit topological cues. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline. Our study not only demonstrates the practical value of explicit topology features in fake-news detection but also provides an interpretable, easily reproducible template for fusing graph metrics in other information-diffusion tasks.</description>

      <title>Learning Multimodal Embeddings for Traffic Accident Prediction and Causal Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.</description>
