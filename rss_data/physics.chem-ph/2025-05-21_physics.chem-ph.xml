      <title>Experimental and theoretical investigation on N2 pressure-induced coefficients of the lowest rotational transitions of HCN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental determination of room-temperature N2 pressure broadening, speed dependent broadening, and pressure shift coefficients of the three lowest rotational lines of HCN. The experimental results served to assess the accuracy of a low-cost yet accurate computational strategy, which relies on a simplified characterization of the HCN-N2 interaction potential, and employs a novel approximate method of solving the quantum scattering problem. Building on the validation of this computational approach, the dataset was extended to higher rotational transitions, up to J(HCN)=5-4. For these transitions, we provide the temperature dependence of the pressure broadening coefficient, its speed dependence parameter, and the Dicke narrowing parameter. This new dataset will be incorporated into the HITRAN database to support and refine the modeling of HCN in both the terrestrial and Titan atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Models for Quantitative Estimates for Performance metrics applied to Saddle Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing use of high-throughput computational chemistry demands rigorous methods for evaluating algorithm performance. We present a Bayesian hierarchical modeling paradigm (brms/Stan) for analyzing key performance metrics: function evaluations, computation time, and success/failure. This framework accounts for variability across different systems and functionals, providing reliable uncertainty estimates beyond subjective visual assessments or frequentist limitations. We applied this to compare conjugate gradient (CG) and L-BFGS algorithms for the Dimer method's rotation phase (EON, with/without removal of external rotations/translations) on a benchmark of 500 initial saddle search approximations, analyzing over 2000 runs. Our results show CG rotations generally outperform L-BFGS, exhibiting a statistically credible, small reduction in PES calls and significantly higher odds of successful convergence. Conversely, enabling rotation removal incurred a substantial PES call penalty without a corresponding credible improvement in success odds in this implementation. These findings, from our novel Bayesian hierarchical modeling application, suggest CG may be preferable for Dimer rotational optimization in similar contexts. This robust statistical framework highlights benefits for revisiting optimization strategies, quantifying uncertainty, and facilitating improved high-throughput computational chemistry methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-enhanced oxygen reduction reaction for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production with different cerium oxide nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated cerium oxide nanoparticles of various morphologies (nanosheets, nanocubes, and nanoparticles) supported on carbon Vulcan XC-72 for the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). It was used a continuous magnetic field (2000 Oe) for the first time in the literature. The best results were for 5% (w/w) CeO2 for all three different morphologies, more than doubling the ring current, enhancing the hydrogen peroxide selectivity from 51% (Vulcan XC-72) to 84-89%, and modifying the onset potential to lesser negative values. The presence of the magnetic field led to even higher ring currents with 5% (w/w) CeO$_2$, H$_2$O$_2$ selectivity from 54% (Vulcan XC-72) to 88-96% and changing even more the onset potential. Those results were correlated with the Zeeman effect, the Lorentz force, generating magnetohydrodynamic effects, the Kelvin force, and the formation of Bound Magnetic Polarons. This pioneering research introduces an innovative approach, highlighting the potential of an external continuous magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Effect of Plasma Treatment on the Spontaneous Formation and Morphology of Surface Nanobubbles on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of gaseous, spherical cap-shaped domains (so-called "surface nanobubbles") at the solid-liquid interface is a topic of fundamental interest due to the possible effects of nanobubbles on surface cleaning, wetting, and nanoscale patterning. This work investigates the spontaneous formation of surface nanobubbles on oxygen plasma-treated Si by PeakForce quantitative nanomechanics (PFQNM) imaging, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and water contact angle measurements. Large quantities of surface nanobubbles with sub-10 nm height and sub-100 nm base width are observed on oxygen plasma-treated Si surfaces that have been "aged" in atmospheric conditions (stored in a plastic wafer container). Several days of aging time are required for surface nanobubbles to form on oxygen plasma-treated Si, at which point the bubbles are remarkably consistent in their properties across samples aged 5-12 days. The presence of surface nanobubbles on plasma-treated aged Si surfaces runs contrary to prior reports of infrequent nanobubble formation on Si/SiOx. Surface characterization supports a theory of post-plasma atmospheric hydrocarbon adsorption inducing changes in Si-wetting behavior to a sufficient extent that nanobubble formation can occur. The results are of importance in Si-based fabrication processes employing oxygen plasma treatment with subsequent DI water immersion.</description>

      <title>Real-time dynamics with bead-Fourier path integrals I: Bead-Fourier CMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing new methods for the accurate and efficient calculations of real-time quantum correlation functions is deemed one of the most challenging problems of modern condensed matter theory. Many popular methods, such as centroid molecular dynamics (CMD), make use of Feynman path integrals (PIs) to efficiently introduce nuclear quantum effects into classical dynamical simulations. Conventional CMD methods use the discretized form of the PI formalism to represent a quantum particle using a series of replicas, or "beads", connected with harmonic springs to create an imaginary time ring polymer. The alternative Fourier PI methodology, instead, represents the imaginary time path using a Fourier sine series. Presented as an intermediary between the two formalisms, bead-Fourier PIs (BF-PIs) have been shown to reduce the number of beads needed to converge equilibrium properties by including a few terms of the Fourier series. Here, a new CMD method is presented where the effective potential is calculated using BF-PIs as opposed to the typical discretized PIs. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of this new BF-CMD method for a series of 1D model systems and show that at low temperatures, one can achieve a 4-fold reduction in the number of beads with the addition of a single Fourier component. The developed methodology is general and can be extended to other closely related methods, such as ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), as well as non-adiabatic PI methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field-enhanced two-electron oxygen reduction reaction using CeMnCo nanoparticles supported on different carbonaceous matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current study illustrates the successful synthesis of Ce$_{1.0}$Mn$_{0.9}$Co$_{0.1}$ nanoparticles, characterized through XRD, EPR, magnetization curves, and TEM/HRTEM/EDX analyses. These nanoparticles were then loaded into the carbon Vulcan XC72 and the carbon Printex L6 matrices in varying amounts (1, 3, 5, and 10% w/w) via wet impregnation method to fabricate electrocatalysts for the 2-electron ORR. Before experimentation, the material was characterized via XPS and contact angle measurements. The electrochemical results produced significant findings, indicating that the electrocatalysts with the nanostructures modifying both carbon blacks notably augmented currents in rotating ring-disk electrode measurements, signifying enhanced selectivity for H$_2$O$_2$ production. Moreover, our research underscored the significant impact of Magnetic Field-Enhanced Electrochemistry, employing a constant magnetic field strength of 2000 Oe, on 2-electron ORR experiments. Particularly noteworthy were the observed results surpassing the ones without the magnetic field, demonstrating heightened currents and improved selectivity for H$_2$O$_2$ production (more than 90 %) facilitated by CeMnCo nanoparticles. These significant findings in electrocatalytic efficiency have practical implications, suggesting the potential for developing more efficient and selective catalysts for the 2-electron ORR.</description>

      <title>Enhanced ammonia electro-oxidation reaction on platinum-iron oxide catalyst assisted by MagnetoElectroCatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonia poses significant environmental challenges due to its role in water pollution, contributing to eutrophication and several detrimental environmental and ecological issues. Addressing the efficient removal or conversion of ammonia is, therefore, critical. Among various methods, the ammonia electro-oxidation reaction stands out due to its potential for direct energy conversion and environment remediation. Here, we synthesize platinum-iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (Pt-MNP) as electrocatalysts and apply an alternating magnetic field (AMF) to enhance their activity.. The AMF generates localized heat via N\'eel relaxation, accelerating ammonia oxidation kinetics at the catalytic surface.. Compared to conventional electro-oxidation methods, this technique demonstrates superior efficiency and stability, offering a promising alternative for ammonia treatment. This work uses the concept of MagnetoElectroCatalysis, showcasing the synergy between magnetic fields and the electrochemical process, leveraging the AMF to induce localized heating within the nanocatalyst, thereby improving its catalytic activity as shown in cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry experiments. By combining nanocatalyst design with innovative AMF application, this study provides a new avenue for enhancing electrochemical reactions, with broad implications for environmental remediation and sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Ionic environment-modulated nucleation and stability of multiscale nanodomains in surfactant-free microemulsions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-clustering occurs in the monophasic "pre-Ouzo" region of ternary liquid mixtures without the use of surfactants. This study is proposed to elucidate the nucleation and stability of multiscale nanodomains in a surfactant-free microemulsion (SFME) system composed of trans-anethol, ethanol and water, tuned by aqueous ionic environment. We examined direct- and reverse-SFME structures with different compositions performed by dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. Our findings demonstrate that extreme pH and ionic strength modulation significantly affect the nucleation and growth of nanodomains, resulting in larger sizes and lower number density of mesoscopic droplets in O/W structuring, whereas the reverse aggregates (W/O structuring) remain stable. Our findings clarify that Ostwald ripening is the primary mechanism to drive the droplet growth. Both theoretical calculation and experiment results match well and reveal that droplet ripening is significantly affected by extreme acidic (pH&lt;3) and alkaline (pH&gt;10) conditions. Electrostatic repulsion in a neutral ionic environment can prevent the coalescence of droplets induced by collision. This research provides an insight into the behavior of multiscale nanodomains in SFME under extensive pH control for applications in material synthesis, drug solubilization and gel preparation.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to process TRISO nuclear fuel using plasma-aided chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a unique and to the best of our knowledge first-of-a-kind attempt to develop chemical processes that may contribute to the volume reduction of SMR TRISO-based fuels and aims at the eventual ability to reprocess the spent fuel. To this end, the etching behavior of two materials, silicon carbide, SiC and pyrolytic carbon, PyC, that are generally used for the different barrier layers of a TRISO particle has been investigated. Either F/NFx or O radicals were used as etching agents and were obtained from NF3 and molecular O2, respectively, using a microwave plasma generated in a remote plasma source RPS. Laser heating of the sample materials of up to 1200 {\deg}C allowed for determination of etching rates. The results of these experiments show that chemical processing of TRISO particles via plasma-assisted etching is possible and complete removal of the encapsulation and TRISO layers can be achieved. Additional research on the waste streams and off-gases, in particular the possibility of introducing intermediate steps to reduce the CO2 formed in the chemical reactions is needed.</description>

      <title>Nanoconfined superionic water is a molecular superionic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superionic ice, where water molecules dissociate into a lattice of oxygen ions and a rapidly diffusing 'gas' of protons, represents an exotic state of matter with broad implications for planetary interiors and energy applications. Recently, a nanoconfined superionic state of water has been predicted which, in sharp contrast to bulk ice, is comprised of intact water molecules. Here, we apply machine learning and electronic structure simulations to establish how nanoconfined water can be both molecular and superionic. We also explore what insights this material offers for superionic materials and behavior more generally. Similar to bulk ice and other superionic materials, nanoconfined water conducts via concerted chain-like proton migrations which cause the rapid propagation of defects. However, unlike other molecular phases of water, its exceptional conductivity arises from the activation of the Grotthuss mechanism by (i) low barriers to proton transfer and (ii) a flexible hydrogen-bonded network. We propose that these are two key characteristics of fast ionic conduction in molecular superionics. The insights obtained here establish design principles for the discovery of other molecular superionic materials, with potential applications in energy storage and beyond.</description>

      <title>Enhanced 133cs Triple-Quantum Excitation in Solid-State NMR of Cs-Bearing Zeolites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geopolymers are aluminosilicate materials that integrate an amorphous phase with crystalline zeolitic domains. Geopolymers exhibit effective immobilization properties for low-level radioactive nuclear waste, and more specifically for the immobilization of radioactive cesium. The identification of the cesium-binding sites and their distribution between the different phases making up the geopolymeric matrix can be obtained using solid-state NMR measurements of the quadrupolar spin 133Cs, which is a surrogate for 134Cs and 137Cs species present in radioactive waste streams. For quadrupolar nuclei, acquiring two-dimensional multiple-quantum experiments allows the acquisition of more dispersed spectra when multiple sites overlap. However, Cs has a spin-7/2 and one of the smallest quadrupole moments, making multiple-quantum excitation highly challenging. In this work we present pulse schemes that enhance the excitation efficiency of 133Cs triple quantum coherences by a factor of ~2 with respect to a two-pulse excitation scheme. The new schemes were developed by using numerical simulation and verified experimentally. We show via nutation experiments as well as two-dimensional triple-quantum solid-state NMR experiments that in hydrated zeolites A and X, which are a simplified model of geopolymer matrices, the cesium binding sites are heterogeneous, and have small (&lt;20 kHz) quadrupolar coupling constants.</description>

      <title>Extending orbital-optimized density functional theory to L-edge XPS and beyond: Spin-orbit coupling via non-orthogonal quasi-degenerate perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical calculations of core electron binding energies (CEBEs) leading to 2p hole states are relevant to interpreting L-edge x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), as well as higher edges. Orbital-optimized density functional theory (OO-DFT) accurately predicts K-edge CEBEs but is challenged by the presence of significant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) at L- and higher edges. To extend OO-DFT to L-edges and higher, our method utilizes scalar-relativistic, spin-restricted OO-DFT to construct a minimal, quasi-degenerate basis of core-hole states corresponding to a chosen inner-shell (e.g. ionizing all six possible 2p spin orbitals). Non-orthogonal configuration interaction (NOCI) is then used to make the matrix elements of the full Hamiltonian including SOC in this quasi-degenerate model space of determinants. Using a screened 1-electron SOC operator parametrized with the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian results in doublet splitting (DS) values for 3rd row atoms that are nearly in quantitative agreement with experiment. The resulting NOCI eigenvalues are shifted by the average of the (scalar) OO-DFT CEBEs to yield CEBEs (split by SOC) corrected for dynamic correlation. Comparing calculations on gas phase molecules with experimental results establishes that NO-QDPT with the SCAN functional (NO-QDPT/SCAN), using the DCB screened 1-electron SOC operator is accurate to about 0.2 eV for L-edge CEBEs of molecules containing 3rd row atoms. However, this NO-QDPT approach becomes less accurate for 4th-row elements starting in the middle of the 3d transition metal series, especially as the atomic number increases.</description>

      <title>Scalable Autoregressive 3D Molecule Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models of 3D molecular structure play a rapidly growing role in the design and simulation of molecules. Diffusion models currently dominate the space of 3D molecule generation, while autoregressive models have trailed behind. In this work, we present Quetzal, a simple but scalable autoregressive model that builds molecules atom-by-atom in 3D. Treating each molecule as an ordered sequence of atoms, Quetzal combines a causal transformer that predicts the next atom's discrete type with a smaller Diffusion MLP that models the continuous next-position distribution. Compared to existing autoregressive baselines, Quetzal achieves substantial improvements in generation quality and is competitive with the performance of state-of-the-art diffusion models. In addition, by reducing the number of expensive forward passes through a dense transformer, Quetzal enables significantly faster generation speed, as well as exact divergence-based likelihood computation. Finally, without any architectural changes, Quetzal natively handles variable-size tasks like hydrogen decoration and scaffold completion. We hope that our work motivates a perspective on scalability and generality for generative modelling of 3D molecules.</description>

This review explores the theoretical and experimental landscapes of these forces, offering a comprehensive analysis of their similarities and distinctions. We emphasize the effects of material properties, geometry, and temperature in shaping these forces and their roles in various nanoscale systems, both colloidal and solid-state. We devote special attention to the Casimir torque, the influence of magnetism on the Casimir force, and the use of Casimir effects for the generation of optical resonators. Through this comparative study, we elucidate the underlying physics of these phenomena, fostering insights that advance applications in nanomechanics, optomechanics, and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Water-rich amorphous state from drying mixed-metal sulfate solutions</title>

Abstract: Amorphous and glassy materials are important for many advanced applications, from flexible solar cells to drug delivery systems. To this end, new glasses are in high demand, but precise chemical design of amorphous materials remains challenging. By studying the crystallization of mixed salt solutions, we have discovered an entirely new type of amorphous material: water-rich amorphous mixed sulfates. Specifically, we show that drying of sulfate salt mixtures of both mono- and higher valency cations almost exclusively yields a glassy or amorphous state, where the stability of the amorphous state depends on the cations present and ranges from seconds to months. Furthermore, we show that the glassy state is viscoelastic, behaves like a soft solid (G' 10^5 - 10^6 Pa), retains a large amount of water (30 to 40 weight percent), and is X-ray amorphous. Additionally, confocal Raman microspectroscopy reveals disordered sulfate orientations and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy highlights increased hydrogen bonding during drying, which together with strong cation hydration is hypothesized to prevent crystallization. These results provide insights for the production of a new class of amorphous materials, and help to elucidate the mystery of the high abundance of such amorphous salts found on Mars.</description>

      <title>Beyond Dielectrics: Interfacial Water Polarization Governs Graphene-Based Electrochemical Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water molecules are traditionally regarded as passive dielectric media in electrochemical systems. In this work, we challenge this conventional perspective using molecular dynamics simulations and theoretical analysis. We show that interfacial water is polarized differently from bulk water and effectively screens the electrostatic potential between ions and the surface. This goes beyond the classic electric double layer (EDL) model, which treated water as merely a passive dielectric. The observed overscreening occurs because a significant portion of water polarization directly responds to the graphene surface, in addition to screening the electrostatic interactions between ions and charged surfaces. Furthermore, we reveal that this surface-induced polarization of interfacial water governs the electric potential distribution and EDL capacitance, and can even invert the electrode surface potential polarity, overriding the contribution of ions. These molecular-level insights lead to a revised EDL model that more accurately describes the electric and chemical potential distributions in the interfacial EDL regions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation Dissipation Relations for the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results demonstrate how deviations from equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be quantified for active field theories by deriving exact fluctuations dissipation relations that involve the entropy production [M. K. Johnsrud and R. Golestanian, arXiv:2409.14977]. Here we develop and employ diagrammatic tools to perform perturbative calculations for a paradigmatic active field theory, the Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. We obtain analytical results, which serve as an illustration of how to implement the recently developed framework to active field theories, and help to illuminate the specific non-equilibrium characteristics of the NRCH field theory.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>
