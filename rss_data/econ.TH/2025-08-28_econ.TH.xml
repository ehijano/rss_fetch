      <title>Exponential Discounting under Partial Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives a novel representation of the exponential discounting model that allows one to assess departures from the model via a measure of efficiency. The approach uses a revealed preference methodology that does not make any parametric assumption on the utility function and allows for unrestricted heterogeneity. The method is illustrated using longitudinal data from checkout scanners and gives insights into sources of departure from exponential discounting.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic, Signals-Based Reinterpretation of Microeconomic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a second-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers may neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g. path-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model results with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic, signals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static models. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic "desert island" Robinson Crusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I then move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force on consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be expressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a recipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations, and the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to employing a static approach to modeling.</description>

      <title>False Cascades and the Cost of Truth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sequential social learning when agents can sometimes pay to verify a claim and obtain hard, publicly checkable evidence. Each agent observes the public history, receives a private signal, may investigate at a cost (succeeding only when the claim is true), and can disclose or conceal any proof. Actions are binary or continuous, with a conformity pull toward the prevailing consensus. We characterize when false cascades persist and when societies self-correct. In the binary benchmark, we derive an investigation cutoff and show how its location relative to classic cascade bands governs breakability; a simple knife-edge condition guarantees that any wrong cascade at the boundary is overturned with positive probability. With continuous actions, coarse observation and conformity can recreate cascades, yet occasional disclosures collapse them. These forces yield a tractable "resilience frontier" with transparent comparative statics and policy levers.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Quality in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a dynamic reputation model with a fixed posted price where only purchases are public. A long-lived seller chooses costly quality; each buyer observes the purchase history and a private signal. Under a Markov selection, beliefs split into two cascades - where actions are unresponsive and investment is zero - and an interior region where the seller invests. The policy is inverse-U in reputation and produces two patterns: Early Resolution (rapid absorption at the optimistic cascade) and Double Hump (two investment episodes). Higher signal precision at fixed prices enlarges cascades and can reduce investment. We compare welfare and analyze two design levers: flexible pricing, which can keep actions informative and remove cascades for patient sellers, and public outcome disclosure, which makes purchases more informative and expands investment.</description>

      <title>Advising with Threshold Tests: Complexity, Signaling, and Effort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A benevolent advisor observes a project's complexity and posts a pass - fail threshold before the agent chooses effort. The project succeeds only if ability and effort together clear complexity. We compare two informational regimes. In the naive regime, the threshold is treated as non-informative; in the sophisticated regime, the threshold is a signal and the agent updates beliefs. We characterize equilibrium threshold policies and show that the optimal threshold rises with complexity under mild regularity. We then give primitives-based sufficient conditions that guarantee separating, pooling, or semi-separating outcomes. In a benchmark with uniform ability, exponential complexity, and power costs, we provide explicit parameter regions that partition the space by equilibrium type; a standard refinement eliminates most pooling. The results yield transparent comparative statics and welfare comparisons across regimes.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Monotonicity and Economic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the extreme points of multidimensional monotone functions from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]$, as well as the extreme points of the set of one-dimensional marginals of these functions. These characterizations lead to new results for various mechanism design and information design problems, including public good provision with interdependent values; interim efficient bilateral trade mechanisms; mechanism (anti) equivalence; asymmetric reduced form auctions; and optimal private private information structure.</description>

      <title>Achieving Irrational Correlated Equilibria without Mediator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the implementation and performance of a decentralized information transmission mechanism in game with complete or incomplete games. We propose a mechanism that realizes irrational correlated equilibria or irrational communication equilibria through a finite rounds of cheap talk without mediator. Designed for games with at least five players, the core procedure involves three players decomposing and encrypting the equilibrium, while two other players securely randomize and deliver the encrypted recommended strategies to designated players. Our results demonstrate that all irrational correlated equilibria or irrational communication equilibria can be achieved through this mechanism, which is both strategically robust and practically implementable.</description>

      <title>Risky Advice and Reputational Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study expert advice under reputational incentives, with sell-side equity research as the lead application. A long-lived analyst receives a continuous private signal about a binary payoff and recommends a risky (Buy) or safe action. Recommendations and outcomes are public, and clients' implementation effort depends on current reputation. In a recursive, belief-based equilibrium: (i) advice follows a cutoff in the signal; (ii) under a simple diagnosticity asymmetry, the cutoff is (weakly) increasing in reputation (reputational conservatism); and (iii) comparative statics are transparent - higher signal precision or a higher success prior lowers the cutoff, whereas stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate via a closed-form mapping. The model predicts that high-reputation analysts make fewer risky calls yet attain higher conditional hit rates, and it clarifies how committee thresholds and monitoring regimes shift behavior.</description>
