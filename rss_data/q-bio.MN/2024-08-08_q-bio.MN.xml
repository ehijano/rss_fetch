      <title>Multiple Notch ligands in the synchronization of the segmentation clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Notch signaling is a ubiquitous and versatile intercellular signaling system that drives collective behaviors and pattern formation in biological tissues. During embryonic development, Notch is involved in generation of collective biochemical oscillations that form the vertebrate body segments, and its failure results in embryonic defects. Notch ligands of the Delta family are key components of this collective rhythm, but it is unclear how different Delta ligands with distinct properties contribute to relaying information among cells. Motivated by the zebrafish segmentation clock, in this work we propose a theory describing interactions between biochemical oscillators, where Notch receptor is bound by both oscillatory and nonoscillatory Delta ligands. Based on previous in vitro binding studies, we first consider Notch activation by Delta dimers. This hypothesis is consistent with experimental observations in conditions of perturbed Notch signaling. Then we test an alternative hypothesis where Delta monomers directly bind and activate Notch, and show that this second model can also describe the experimental observations. We show that these two hypotheses assign different roles for a non-oscillatory ligand, as a binding partner or as a baseline signal. Finally, we discuss experiments to distinguish between the two scenarios. Broadly, this work highlights how a multiplicity of ligands may be harnessed by a signaling system to generate versatile responses.</description>

      <title>Channel assisted noise propagation in a two-step cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signal propagation in biochemical networks is characterized by the inherent randomness in gene expression and fluctuations of the environmental components, commonly known as intrinsic and extrinsic noise, respectively. We present a theoretical framework for noise propagation in a generic two-step cascade (S$\rightarrow$X$\rightarrow$Y) regarding intrinsic and extrinsic noise. We identify different channels of noise transmission that regulate the individual and the overall noise properties of each component. Our analysis shows that the intrinsic noise of S alleviates the general noise and information transmission capacity along the cascade. On the other hand, the intrinsic noise of X and Y acts as a bottleneck of information transmission. We also show a hierarchical relationship among the intrinsic noise levels of S, X, and Y, with S exhibiting the highest level of intrinsic noise, followed by X and then Y. This hierarchy is preserved within the two-step cascade, facilitating the highest information transmission from S to Y via X.</description>
