      <title>Signature of hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by systematic numerical-relativity simulations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and only the crossover scenario makes it collapse into a black hole due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. These features pave the way for clarifying details of hadron-quark transition by compiling a wide variety of events observed with future gravitational-wave detectors. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition.</description>

      <title>Study of accretion disks around black holes with two types of gas inflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilized steady-state, axisymmetric, viscous hydrodynamic fluid equations around a black hole in a Schwarzschild geometry background. Here, the relativistic Schwarzschild geometry is mimicked by the Paczy{\'n}sky-Wiita potential. We investigated two types of inflowing gases that can generate different kinds of accretion flows around the central objects. The inflowing gases are presented on the local energies ($B_{ob}$) of the gases versus the outermost accretion boundary locations ($r_{ob}$) plane we named it the outermost boundary condition (OBC)-plane. Based on the energies of the inflowing gases we found two types of inflowing gas classified as cold-mode and hot-mode inflowing gases in the OBC-plane. Doing so we have found the initial temperature of the inflowing gases can be a parameter for the study of the accretion process. As it can affect the disk structure and optical depth of the accretion flow, which in turn can impact the radiative emissions observed in many accreting sources.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation with Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the values of the parameters of the Generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (GTOV) equation through Bayesian inference. We use the mass and radius data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) for PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, as well as the mass, radius, and dimensionless tidal deformability from the gravitational wave (GW) events GW190814 and GW170817. We use two distinct parameterizations of the extended non-linear Walecka model (eNLW) with and without hyperons. The GTOV employed for the study contains additional free parameters with different physical motivations. Two possible scenarios are considered in our analysis: conservative and speculative. In the first case, we take into account the most reliable neutron star (NS) data from NICER and the GW170817 event. In the second case, we consider the possibility that the compact object with a mass of $2.54 M_{\odot}$ in the GW190814 event is an NS. Our findings show significant improvements in the physical quantities analyzed, leading to better agreement with the observational data compared to the results obtained using the TOV equation.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning classifier for the postmerger remnant of binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the kind of remnant produced after the merger of a binary neutron star system, e.g., if a black hole forms or not, would not only shed light on the equation of state describing the extremely dense matter inside neutron stars, but also help understand the physical processes involved in the postmerger phase. Moreover, in the event of a gravitational-wave detection, predicting the presence of a neutron star remnant is crucial in order to advise potential electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. In this work, we use Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and publicly available data from numerical-relativity simulations to construct a classifier that predicts the outcome of binary neutron star mergers, based on the binary's parameters inferred from gravitational-wave inspiral signals: total mass, mass-weighted tidal deformability, mass ratio, and effective inspiral spin. Employing parameters that can be estimated from the inspiral part of the signal only allows us to predict the remnant independently on the detection of a postmerger gravitational-wave signal. We build three different classifiers to distinguish between various potential scenarios, we estimate their accuracy and the confidence of their predictions. Finally, we apply the developed classifiers to real events data, finding that GW170817 most likely lead to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star, while GW190425 to a prompt collapse to a black hole.</description>

      <title>Viewing the explosion models of type Ia supernovae via the insight from terrestrial cellular detonation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cellular structure is considered to be a key as a criterion in initiation, propagation, and quenching of terrestrial detonation. While a few studies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have addressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment will benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present study, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing on the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering process for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are quantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that widely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation of detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic simulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing to apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical problems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism of type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Ejecta Width and Magnetization Reflected in Gamma-Ray Burst Early Afterglows: Implication for Reverse Shock Component and Shallow Decay Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To study the ejecta property dependence of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglow, we carry out spherically symmetrical one-dimensional special relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of magnetized outflows with an adaptive mesh refinement method. The Lorentz factor evolutions of forward and reverse shocks induced by the interaction between magnetized ejecta and an ambient medium are investigated for a wide range of magnetization and width of the ejecta. The forward shock evolution is described by the magnetic acceleration, coasting, transition, and self-similar deceleration phases. According to our simulation results, we numerically calculate the corresponding radiation. Based on our numerical results, to model afterglow light curves in general cases, we construct semi-analytical formulae for the Lorentz factor evolutions. The magnetization and ejecta width dependence are clearly seen in the reverse shock light curves. The transition phase with a reasonable ejecta width can reproduce the shallow decay phase in the observed GRB afterglow. The inverse Compton emission in the magnetic acceleration phase can be responsible for the very steep rise of the early TeV emission in GRB221009A.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall Waves Launched by Superconducting Phase Transition in Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cores of pulsars are expected to become superconducting soon after birth. The transition to type-II superconductivity is associated with the bunching of magnetic field lines into discrete superconducting flux tubes which possess enormous tension. The coupling of the crust to the flux tubes implies the existence of huge tangential magnetic fields at the crust-core interface. We show that the transition to superconductivity triggers a highly non-linear response in the Hall drift of the crustal magnetic field, an effect which was neglected in previous numerical modelling. We argue that at the time of the phase transition giant Hall waves are launched from the crust-core interface toward the surface. Our models show that if the crust contains a multipolar magnetic field $\sim 10^{13}$ G, the amplitude of the Hall waves is $\sim 10^{15}$ G. The elastic deformation of the lattice is included in our models, which allows us to track the time-dependent shear stresses everywhere in the crust. The simulations indicate that the Hall waves may be strong enough to break the crust, and could cause star quakes which trigger rotation glitches and changes in the radio pulse profile. The Hall waves also couple to slow magnetospheric changes which cause anomalous braking indices. The emission of the giant Hall waves from the crust-core interface facilitates fast flux expulsion from the superconducting core, provided that the flux tubes in the core are themselves sufficiently mobile. For all of the flux tube mobility prescriptions implemented in this work, the core approaches the Meissner state with B=0 at late times.</description>

      <title>Search for the Hawking radiation of primordial black holes: prospective sensitivity of LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with initial mass $\sim5\times10^{14}$ g are evaporating due to Hawking radiation, leading to bursts of very-high-energy gamma rays. In this work, we investigate the prospective sensitivity of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to measure the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our findings reveal that LHAASO is capable of searching for the PBH bursts within a distance $\sim0.1$ pc from the sun and thereby measure the local burst rate density $\sim$ 1164 (or 699)$\,\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $99\%$ confidence level during a 3 (or 5) year observing run. This stands for a sensitivity that is one order of magnitude stronger than the strongest observational constraint from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). In addition, we further suggest an observing strategy to search for the PBH bursts during upcoming observing runs of LHAASO.</description>

      <title>Fate of the remnant in tidal stripping event: repeating and non-repeating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDE) occur when a star ventures too close to a massive black hole. In a partial TDE (pTDE), the star only grazes the tidal radius, causing the outer envelope of the star to be stripped away while the stellar core survives. Previous research has shown that a star, once tidally stripped in a parabolic orbit, can acquire enough orbital energy for its remnant to become a high-velocity star potentially capable of escaping the galaxy. Conversely, some studies have reported that the remnant may lose orbital energy and undergo re-disruption, leading to a recurring pTDE. This study aims to uncover the physical mechanisms and determine the conditions that lead to these divergent outcomes. We find that the orbital energy change only depends on the impact factor and the stellar structure, and barely depends on the mass of the black hole or the exact mass or orbital eccentricity of the star. For a $\gamma=5/3$ (or $\gamma=4/3$) polytropic star, after a pTDE its remnant gains orbital energy when the impact factor $\beta \gtrsim 0.62$ (or $\gtrsim 1.1$) or loses energy vice versa. Additionally, we verify an analytical equation for orbital energy change that is applicable across various systems. Through hydrodynamic simulations, we also explore the structure of the stellar remnant post-tidal stripping. Our findings provide critical insights for interpreting observed pTDEs and advancing knowledge on the orbital evolution and event rate of these events.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV gamma-ray emission from SPT-CL J2012-5649 with six years of DAMPE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for gamma-ray emission from the galaxy cluster SPT-CL J2012-5649 in the energy range from 3 GeV to 1 TeV using the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) telescope. For our analysis, we use three different templates: point source, radial disk and radial Gaussian. We do not detect a signal with significance $&gt;3\sigma$ for any of these templates at any location with $R_{200}$ of the cluster center. We obtain 95\% c.l. upper limit on the energy flux between $\sim 10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4} \rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ depending on the energy range. These upper limits are consistent with the a non-zero flux detected by Fermi-LAT (at $6\sigma$ significance) for this cluster. This work represents the first proof of principle search for gamma-ray emission from a single galaxy cluster using DAMPE data.</description>

      <title>Detection and localisation of the highly active FRB 20240114A with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of the highly active FRB 20240114A with MeerKAT using the Ultra-High Frequency (UHF; $544\text{--}1088$ MHz) and L-band ($856\text{--}1712$ MHz) receivers. A total of 62 bursts were detected in coherent tied-array beams using the MeerTRAP real-time transient detection pipeline. We measure a structure-optimising dispersion measure of $527.65\pm0.01\,\text{pc}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ using the brightest burst in the sample. We find the bursts of FRB 20240114A are generally detected in part of the broad band of MeerKAT, $\sim40\%$ in the UHF and $\sim30\%$ in the L-band, indicating the band limited nature. We analyse the fluence distribution of the 44 bursts detected at UHF, constraining the fluence completeness limit to $\sim1\,$Jy ms, above which the cumulative burst rate follows a power law $R (&gt;F)\propto (F/1\,\text{Jy}\,\text{ms})^\gamma$ with $\gamma=-1.8\pm0.2$. Using channelised telescope data captured in our transient buffer we localise FRB 20240114A in the image domain to RA = 21h27m39.86s, Dec = +04d19m45.01s with an uncertainty of 1.4 arcsec. This localisation allows us to confidently identify the host galaxy of FRB 20240114A. Also using the transient buffer data we perform a polarimetric study and demonstrate that most of the bursts have $\sim100\%$ linear polarisation fractions and up to $\sim20\%$ circular polarisation fractions. Finally, we predict the flux density of a potential persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A is $\backsimeq[0.6\text{--}60]\,\mu\text{Jy}$ based on the simple relation between the luminosity of the PRS and the rotation measure arising from the FRB local environment.</description>

      <title>Identifying jittering-jet-shaped ejecta in the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing images of the Cygnus Loop, a core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant, in different emission bands, we identify a point-symmetrical morphology composed of three symmetry axes that we attribute to shaping by three pairs of jets. The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a faint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the structure of three symmetry lines, the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other lines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side of the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray, UV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the southern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout at the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of the Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with stochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets that shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic pairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. This test will be highly valuable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.05 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.008 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find that the current evidence for an extra mode is comparable to that for the first gravitational overtone, but its inclusion modifies the inferred remnant spin.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Lensing Tomography of Black Hole Ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

Abstract: A new image-reconstruction algorithm, PRIMO, applied to the interferometric data of the M87 black hole collected with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), resulted in an image that reached the native resolution of the telescope array. PRIMO is based on learning a compact set of image building blocks obtained from a large library of high-fidelity, physics-based simulations of black hole images. It uses these building blocks to fill the sparse Fourier coverage of the data that results from the small number of telescopes in the array. In this paper, we show that this approach is readily justified. Since the angular extent of the image of the black hole and of its inner accretion flow is finite, the Fourier space domain is heavily smoothed, with a correlation scale that is at most comparable to the sizes of the data gaps in the coverage of Fourier space with the EHT. Consequently, PRIMO or other machine-learning algorithms can faithfully reconstruct the images without the need to generate information that is unconstrained by the data within the resolution of the array. We also address the completeness of the eigenimages and the compactness of the resulting representation. We show that PRIMO provides a compact set of eigenimages that have sufficient complexity to recreate a broad set of images well beyond those in the training set.</description>

      <title>Compression Acceleration of Protons and Heavier Ions at the Heliospheric Current Sheet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10445v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) suggest that protons and heavier ions are accelerated to high energies by magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet (HCS). By solving the energetic particle transport equation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration of protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the acceleration of multi-species ions results in nonthermal power-law distributions with spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our study shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach $E_{max} \sim 0.1$ - $1$ MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how the high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass ratio $E_{max} \propto (Q/M)^\alpha$. When determining the diffusion coefficients from the quasilinear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power spectrum, we find that $\alpha \sim 0.4$, which is somewhat smaller than $\alpha \sim 0.7$ observed by PSP.</description>

      <title>SAUNAS II: Discovery of Cross-shaped X-ray Emission and a Rotating Circumnuclear Disk in the Supermassive S0 Galaxy NGC 5084</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining Chandra, ALMA, EVLA, and Hubble Space Telescope archival data and newly acquired APO/DIS spectroscopy, we detect a double-lobed 17~kpc X-ray emission with plumes oriented approximately perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane of the massive lenticular galaxy NGC\,5084 at 0.3--2.0~keV.
  We detect a highly inclined ($i=71.2^{+1.8\circ}_{-1.7}$), molecular circumnuclear disk ($D=304^{+10}_{-11}$ pc) in the core of the galaxy rotating (V$^{\rm (2-1) CO}_{\rm rot}=242.7^{+9.6}_{-6.4}$ km s$^{-1}$) in a direction perpendicular to that of the galactic disk, implying a total mass of $\log_{10}\left( \frac{M_{\rm BH}}{M_{\odot}} \right) = 7.66^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ for NGC\,5084's supermassive black hole. Archival EVLA radio observations at 6 cm and 20 cm reveal two symmetric radio lobes aligned with the galactic plane, extending to a distance of $\overline{R}=4.6\pm0.6$ kpc from the core, oriented with the polar axis of the circumnuclear disk. The spectral energy distribution lacks strong emission lines in the optical range.
  Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multi-wavelength archival observations: 1) AGN re-orientation caused by accretion of surrounding material, 2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis, or 3) a starburst / supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy. This discovery is enabled by new imaging analysis tools including \SAUNAS\ (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), demonstrating the abundance of information still to be exploited in the vast and growing astronomical archives.</description>

      <title>High-redshift Cosmology by Gamma-Ray Bursts: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several correlations among Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) quantities, both in the prompt and afterglow emissions, have been established during the last decades, thus enabling the standardization of GRBs as cosmological probes. Since GRBs are observed up to redshift $z \sim 9$, they represent a valuable tool to fill in the gap of information on the Universe evolution between the farthest type Ia supernovae and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation and to shed new light on the current challenging cosmological tensions. Without claiming for completeness, here we describe the state of the art of GRB correlations, their theoretical interpretations, and their cosmological applications both as standalone probes and in combination with other probes. In this framework, we pinpoint the importance of correcting the correlations for selection biases and redshift evolution to derive intrinsic relations, the assets of combining probes at different scales, and the need for the employment of the appropriate cosmological likelihood to precisely constrain cosmological parameters. Furthermore, we emphasize the benefits of the cosmographic approach to avoid any cosmological assumptions and the valuable applications of machine learning techniques to reconstruct GRB light curves and predict unknown GRB redshifts. Finally, we stress the relevance of all these factors, along with future observations, to definitely boost the power of GRBs in cosmology.</description>

      <title>YSO Jets Magnetocentrifugally Driven by Reconnecting Atmospheric Avalanche Accretion Streams Above Inner Circumstellar Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast, collimated jets are ubiquitous features of young stellar objects (YSOs). They are generally thought to be powered by disk accretion, but the details are debated. Through 2D (axisymmetric) MHD simulations, we find that a fast ($&gt;100$~km/s) collimated bipolar jet is continuously driven along the north and south poles of the circumstellar disk that is initially magnetized by a large-scale open poloidal field and contains a thermally ionized inner magnetically active zone surrounded by a dead zone. The fast jet is primarily driven magneto-centrifugally by the release of the gravitational binding energy of the so-called ``avalanche accretion streams" near the boundary of an evacuated poloidal field-dominated polar region and a thick disk atmosphere raised by a toroidal magnetic field. Specifically, the fast outflow is driven along the upper (open) branch of the highly pinched poloidal field lines threading the (strongly magnetically braked) accretion streams where the density is relatively low so that the lightly loaded material can be accelerated magneto-centrifugally along the open field line to a high speed. The highly pinched poloidal magnetic fields threading the avalanche accretion streams tend to reconnect, enabling mass to accrete to the center without dragging along the poloidal magnetic flux with it. The reconnection provides a potential heating source for producing chondrules and calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs).</description>

      <title>Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a strong rotation of the X-ray polarization angle in the galactic burster GX 13+1</title>

Abstract: Weakly magnetized neutron stars in X-ray binaries show complex phenomenology with several spectral components that can be associated with the accretion disk, boundary and/or spreading layer, a corona, and a wind. Spectroscopic information alone is, however, not enough to disentangle these components. Additional information about the nature of the spectral components and in particular the geometry of the emission region can be provided by X-ray polarimetry. One of the objects of the class, a bright, persistent, and rather peculiar galactic Type I X-ray burster was observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission Newton (XMM-Newton). Using the XMM-Newton data we estimated the current state of the source as well as detected strong absorption lines associated with the accretion disk wind. IXPE data showed the source to be significantly polarized in the 2-8 keV energy band with the overall polarization degree (PD) of 1.4% at a polarization angle (PA) of -2 degrees (errors at 68% confidence level). During the two-day long observation, we detected rotation of the PA by about 70 degrees with the corresponding changes in the PD from 2% to non-detectable and then up to 5%. These variations in polarization properties are not accompanied by visible changes in spectroscopic characteristics. The energy-resolved polarimetric analysis showed a significant change in polarization, from being strongly dependent on energy at the beginning of the observation to being almost constant with energy in the later parts of the observation. As a possible interpretation, we suggest the presence of a constant component of polarization, strong wind scattering, or different polarization of the two main spectral components with individually peculiar behavior. The rotation of the PA suggests a 30-degree misalignment of the neutron star spin from the orbital axis.</description>

      <title>Delayed emission from luminous blue optical transients in black-hole binary systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At least three members of the recently identified class of fast luminous blue optical transient show evidence of late-time electromagnetic activity in great excess of what predicted by an extrapolation of the early time emission. In particular, AT2022tsd displays fast, bright optical fluctuations approximately a month after the initial detection. Here, we propose that these transients are produced by exploding stars in black hole binary systems, and that the late-time activity is due to the accretion of clumpy ejecta onto the companion black hole. We derive the energetics and timescales involved, compute the emission spectrum, and discuss whether the ensuing emission is diffused or not in the remnant. We find that this model can explain the observed range of behaviors for reasonable ranges of the orbital separation and the ejecta velocity and clumpiness. Close separation and clumpy, high velocity ejecta result in bright variable emission, as seen in AT2022tsd. A wider separation and smaller ejecta velocity, conversely, give rise to fairly constant emission at a lower luminosity. We suggest that high-cadence, simultaneous, panchromatic monitoring of future transients should be carried out to better understand the origin of the late emission and the role of binarity in the diversity of explosive stellar transients.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational-wave bursts from black hole binaries in the Galactic Center with LISA</title>

Abstract: Stellar-mass black hole binaries (BHBs) in galactic nuclei are gravitationally perturbed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the host galaxy, potentially inducing strong eccentricity oscillations through the eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism. These highly eccentric binaries emit a train of gravitational-wave (GW) bursts detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) -- a planned space-based GW detector -- with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) up to ${\sim}100$ per burst. In this work, we study the GW signature of BHBs orbiting our galaxy's SMBH, Sgr A$^*$, which are consequently driven to very high eccentricities. We demonstrate that an unmodeled approach using a wavelet decomposition of the data effectively yields the time-frequency properties of each burst, provided that the GW frequency peaks between $10^{-3}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$--$10^{-1}\,\,\mathrm{Hz}$. The wavelet parameters may be used to infer the eccentricity of the binary, measuring $\log_{10}(1-e)$ within an error of $20\%$. Our proposed search method can thus constrain the parameter space to be sampled by complementary Bayesian inference methods, which use waveform templates or orthogonal wavelets to reconstruct and subtract the signal from LISA data.</description>

      <title>Exploring pathways to forming twin stars</title>

Abstract: A viable model for the dense matter equation of state above the nuclear saturation density includes a hadron-to-quark phase transition at densities relevant to compact objects. In this case, stable hybrid hadron-quark stars can arise. An even more interesting scenario is one where the hadron-to-quark phase transition results in the emergence of a third branch of stable compact objects (in addition to white dwarfs and neutron stars). Inherent to the presence of a third family of compact stars is the existence of twin stars - hybrid stars with the same mass as the corresponding neutron stars, but with smaller radii. Interestingly, the neutron star-twin star scenario is consistent with GW170817. If twin stars exist in nature, it raises a question about the mechanism that leads to their formation. Here, we explore gravitational collapse as a pathway to the formation of low-mass twin stars. We perform fully general relativistic simulations of the collapse of a stellar iron core, modeled as a cold degenerate gas, to investigate whether the end product is a neutron star or a twin star. Our simulations show that even with unrealistically large perturbations in the initial conditions, the core bounces well below the hadron-to-quark phase transition density, if the initial total rest mass is in the twin star range. Following cooling, these configurations produce neutron stars. We find that twin stars can potentially form due to mass loss, e.g., through winds, from a slightly more massive hybrid star that was initially produced in the collapse of a more massive core or if the maximum neutron star mass is below the Chandrasekhar mass limit. The challenge in producing twin stars in gravitational collapse, in conjunction with the fine-tuning required because of their narrow mass range, suggests the rarity of twin stars in nature.</description>

      <title>The compact circumstellar material of SN 2024ggi: Another supernova with a pre-explosion effervescent zone and jet-driven explosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine recent theoretical studies and observations of the recent core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 20224ggi and find that the likely explanation for its dense, compact circumstellar material is an effervescent model, where parcels or streams of gas are uplifted by stellar convection and pulsation and fall back. The effervescent zone exists alongside the regular wind from the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor of SN 2024ggi. I find that an extended wind-acceleration zone encounters some difficulties in accounting for the required CSM mass. Recent modelling finds the explosion energy of SN 2024ggi to be &gt;1e51 erg, and up to 2e51 erg. I examine this explosion energy against a recent study of the delayed neutrino explosion mechanism and find that this mechanism might have some difficulties in accounting for the required energy. This might suggest that the explosion was caused by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). This adds to other recent pieces of evidence supporting the JJEM, particularly point-symmetric CCSN remnants.</description>

      <title>A physical model for radio and X-ray correlation in black hole X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A tight correlation between the radio and X-ray emission in the hard state of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) indicates an intrinsic disc-jet connection in stellar black hole accretion systems, though the detailed physics processes at work are still quite unclear. A hot accretion flow is suggested to match the outer cold thin disc at a certain radius in the hard state, which may vary with the accretion rate. In this work, we assume that the magnetic field generated in the outer thin disc is advected inwards by the inner hot accretion flow, which is substantially enhanced near the BH. Such a strong field threading the horizon of a spinning BH is responsible for launching relativistic jets in BHXRBs via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Thus, both the jet power and the X-ray emission increase with the mass accretion rate, and we find that our model calculations are able to reproduce the observed radio/X-ray correlation quantitatively. For some individual BHXRBs, the slopes of the radio/X-ray correlations become steeper when the sources are brighter. Our model calculations show that this feature is due to the transition of the outer disc with gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated, which leads to different accretion rate dependence of the field strength in the outer disc.</description>

      <title>Pair-instability evolution and explosions in massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very massive stars are radiation pressure dominated. Before running out of viable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where electron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering their collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long been predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational pair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black hole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all stellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova), which leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among modelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very high-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational confirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution on black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the present and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high redshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the current understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis on the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed electromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and indirect searches.</description>

      <title>Structure in the speed of sound: from neutron stars to heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From the observation of both heavy neutron stars and light ones with small radii, one anticipates a steep rise in the speed of sound of nuclear matter as a function of baryon density up to values close to the causal limit. A question follows whether such behavior of the speed of sound in neutron-rich matter is compatible with the equation of state extracted from low-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we consider a family of neutron star equations of state characterized by a steep rise in the speed of sound, and use the symmetry energy expansion to obtain equations of state applicable to the almost-symmetric nuclear matter created in heavy-ion collisions. We then compare collective flow data from low-energy heavy-ion experiments with results of simulations obtained using the hadronic transport code SMASH with the mean-field potential reproducing the density-dependence of the speed of sound. We show that equations of state featuring a peak in the speed of sound squared occurring at densities between 2-3 times the saturation density of normal nuclear matter, producing neutron stars of nearly M_max~2.5 M_Sun, are consistent with heavy-ion collision data.</description>

      <title>The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: Slow supernovae show cosmological time dilation out to $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05050v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a precise measurement of cosmological time dilation using the light curves of 1504 type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey spanning a redshift range $0.1\lesssim z\lesssim 1.2$. We find that the width of supernova light curves is proportional to $(1+z)$, as expected for time dilation due to the expansion of the Universe. Assuming type Ia supernovae light curves are emitted with a consistent duration $\Delta t_{\rm em}$, and parameterising the observed duration as $\Delta t_{\rm obs}=\Delta t_{\rm em}(1+z)^b$, we fit for the form of time dilation using two methods. Firstly, we find that a power of $b \approx 1$ minimises the flux scatter in stacked subsamples of light curves across different redshifts. Secondly, we fit each target supernova to a stacked light curve (stacking all supernovae with observed bandpasses matching that of the target light curve) and find $b=1.003\pm0.005$ (stat) $\pm\,0.010$ (sys). Thanks to the large number of supernovae and large redshift-range of the sample, this analysis gives the most precise measurement of cosmological time dilation to date, ruling out any non-time-dilating cosmological models at very high significance.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: X-ray beacons at late cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS) is expected to contain ~100 quasars that emitted their light when the universe was less than a billion years old, i.e. at z&gt;5.6. By selection, these quasars populate the bright end of the AGN X-ray luminosity function and their count offers a powerful demographic diagnostic of the parent super-massive black hole population. Of the &gt;~ 400 quasars that have been discovered at z&gt;5.6 to date, less than 15 % have been X-ray detected. We present a pilot survey to uncover the elusive X-ray luminous end of the distant quasar population. We have designed a quasar selection pipeline based on optical, infrared and X-ray imaging data from DES DR2, VHS DR5, CatWISE2020 and the eRASS. The core selection method relies on SED template fitting. We performed optical follow-up spectroscopy with the Magellan/LDSS3 instrument for the redshift confirmation of a subset of candidates. We have further obtained a deeper X-ray image of one of our candidates with Chandra ACIS-S. We report the discovery of five new quasars in the redshift range 5.6 &lt; z &lt; 6.1. Two of these quasars are detected in eRASS and are by selection X-ray ultra-luminous. These quasars are also detected at radio frequencies. The first one is a broad absorption line quasar which shows significant X-ray dimming over 3.5 years, i.e. about 6 months in the quasar rest frame. The second radio-detected quasar is a jetted source with compact morphology. We show that a blazar configuration is likely for this source, making it the second most distant blazar known to date. With our pilot study, we demonstrate the power of eROSITA as a discovery machine for luminous quasars in the epoch of reionization. The X-ray emission of the two eROSITA detected quasars are likely to be driven by different high-energetic emission mechanisms a diversity which will be further explored in a future systematic full-hemisphere survey.</description>

      <title>Eccentric features in the gravitational wave phase of dynamically formed black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) phase shift arising from center-of-mass accelerations of binary black hole mergers formed dynamically in three-body systems, where both the inner orbit of the merging binary and the outer orbit are eccentric. We provide a semi-analytical model and several analytical approximations that allow for fast evaluation of both the temporal evolution and the maximum value of the phase shift. The highest phase shifts occur when the binary merges close to the pericentre of the outer orbit, and can in this case be orders-of-magnitude larger compared to the circular limit. At high outer orbit eccentricities, the orbital curvature leaves distinct imprints onto the phase shift if the binary passes the outer pericentre during its inspiral. By comparing with phase shifts measured in numerical chaotic 3-body scatterings, we show that our model accurately describes the observed phase of dynamically assembled binary systems in realistic astrophysical scenarios, providing a way to directly determine their formation channel via single GW observations.</description>
