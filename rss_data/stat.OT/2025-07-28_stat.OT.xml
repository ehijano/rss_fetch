      <title>Multivariate Conformal Prediction via Conformalized Gaussian Scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While achieving exact conditional coverage in conformal prediction is unattainable without making strong, untestable regularity assumptions, the promise of conformal prediction hinges on finding approximations to conditional guarantees that are realizable in practice. A promising direction for obtaining conditional dependence for conformal sets--in particular capturing heteroskedasticity--is through estimating the conditional density $\mathbb{P}_{Y|X}$ and conformalizing its level sets. Previous work in this vein has focused on nonconformity scores based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF). Such scores are, however, computationally costly, typically requiring expensive sampling methods. To avoid the need for sampling, we observe that the CDF-based score reduces to a Mahalanobis distance in the case of Gaussian scores, yielding a closed-form expression that can be directly conformalized. Moreover, the use of a Gaussian-based score opens the door to a number of extensions of the basic conformal method; in particular, we show how to construct conformal sets with missing output values, refine conformal sets as partial information about $Y$ becomes available, and construct conformal sets on transformations of the output space. Finally, empirical results indicate that our approach produces conformal sets that more closely approximate conditional coverage in multivariate settings compared to alternative methods.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Cram\'er-Rao Bound Using Information Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In information geometry, statistical models are considered as differentiable manifolds, where each probability distribution represents a unique point on the manifold. A Riemannian metric can be systematically obtained from a divergence function using Eguchi's theory (1992); the well-known Fisher-Rao metric is obtained from the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The geometric derivation of the classical Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) by Amari and Nagaoka (2000) is based on this metric. In this paper, we study a Riemannian metric obtained by applying Eguchi's theory to the Basu-Harris-Hjort-Jones (BHHJ) divergence (1998) and derive a generalized Cram\'er-Rao bound using Amari-Nagaoka's approach. There are potential applications for this bound in robust estimation.</description>

      <title>The information mismatch, and how to fix it</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15382</link>

Abstract: We live in unprecedented times in terms of our ability to use evidence to inform medical care. For example, we can perform data-driven post-test probability calculations. However, there is work to do. As has been previously noted, sensitivity and specificity, which play a key role in post-test probability calculations, are defined as unadjusted for patient covariates. In light of this, there have been multiple recommendations that sensitivity and specificity be adjusted for covariates. However, there is less work on the downstream clinical impact of unadjusted sensitivity and specificity. We discuss this here. We argue that unadjusted sensitivity and specificity, when mixed with covariate-dependent pre-test probability scores (which are more easily available nowadays given the multitude of online calculators), can lead to a post-test probability that contains an ``information mismatch.'' We write the equations behind such an information mismatch and discuss the steps that can be taken to fix it.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Solutions Integrated in an IoT Healthcare Platform for Heart Failure Risk Stratification</title>

Abstract: The management of chronic Heart Failure (HF) presents significant challenges in modern healthcare, requiring continuous monitoring, early detection of exacerbations, and personalized treatment strategies. In this paper, we present a predictive model founded on Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify patients at HF risk. This model is an ensemble learning approach, a modified stacking technique, that uses two specialized models leveraging clinical and echocardiographic features and then a meta-model to combine the predictions of these two models. We initially assess the model on a real dataset and the obtained results suggest that it performs well in the stratification of patients at HR risk. Specifically, we obtained high sensitivity (95\%), ensuring that nearly all high-risk patients are identified. As for accuracy, we obtained 84\%, which can be considered moderate in some ML contexts. However, it is acceptable given our priority of identifying patients at risk of HF because they will be asked to participate in the telemonitoring program of the PrediHealth research project on which some of the authors of this paper are working. The initial findings also suggest that ML-based risk stratification models can serve as valuable decision-support tools not only in the PrediHealth project but also for healthcare professionals, aiding in early intervention and personalized patient management. To have a better understanding of the value and of potentiality of our predictive model, we also contrasted its results with those obtained by using three baseline models. The preliminary results indicate that our predictive model outperforms these baselines that flatly consider features, \ie not grouping them in clinical and echocardiographic features.</description>
