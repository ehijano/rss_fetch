      <title>Correlated Synthetic Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Control methods have recently gained considerable attention in applications with only one treated unit. Their popularity is partly based on the key insight that we can predict good synthetic counterfactuals for our treated unit. However, this insight of predicting counterfactuals is generalisable to microeconometric settings where we often observe many treated units. We propose the Correlated Synthetic Controls (CSC) estimator for such situations: intuitively, it creates synthetic controls that are correlated across individuals with similar observables. When treatment assignment is correlated with unobservables, we show that the CSC estimator has more desirable theoretical properties than the difference-in-differences estimator. We also utilise CSC in practice to obtain heterogeneous treatment effects in the well-known Mariel Boatlift study, leveraging additional information from the PSID.</description>

      <title>Breakdown Analysis for Instrumental Variables with Binary Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the partial identification of treatment effects in Instrumental Variables (IV) settings with binary outcomes under violations of independence. I derive the identified sets for the treatment parameters of interest in the setting, as well as breakdown values for conclusions regarding the true treatment effects. I derive $\sqrt{N}$-consistent nonparametric estimators for the bounds of treatment effects and for breakdown values. These results can be used to assess the robustness of empirical conclusions obtained under the assumption that the instrument is independent from potential quantities, which is a pervasive concern in studies that use IV methods with observational data. In the empirical application, I show that the conclusions regarding the effects of family size on female unemployment using same-sex sibling as the instrument are highly sensitive to violations of independence.</description>

      <title>An Algorithm for Identifying Interpretable Subgroups With Elevated Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for identifying interpretable subgroups with elevated treatment effects, given an estimate of individual or conditional average treatment effects (CATE). Subgroups are characterized by ``rule sets'' -- easy-to-understand statements of the form (Condition A AND Condition B) OR (Condition C) -- which can capture high-order interactions while retaining interpretability. Our method complements existing approaches for estimating the CATE, which often produce high dimensional and uninterpretable results, by summarizing and extracting critical information from fitted models to aid decision making, policy implementation, and scientific understanding. We propose an objective function that trades-off subgroup size and effect size, and varying the hyperparameter that controls this trade-off results in a ``frontier'' of Pareto optimal rule sets, none of which dominates the others across all criteria. Valid inference is achievable through sample splitting. We demonstrate the utility and limitations of our method using simulated and empirical examples.</description>

      <title>Inference for Rank-Rank Regressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15512v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slope coefficient in a rank-rank regression is a popular measure of intergenerational mobility. In this article, we first show that commonly used inference methods for this slope parameter are invalid. Second, when the underlying distribution is not continuous, the OLS estimator and its asymptotic distribution may be highly sensitive to how ties in the ranks are handled. Motivated by these findings we develop a new asymptotic theory for the OLS estimator in a general class of rank-rank regression specifications without imposing any assumptions about the continuity of the underlying distribution. We then extend the asymptotic theory to other regressions involving ranks that have been used in empirical work. Finally, we apply our new inference methods to two empirical studies on intergenerational mobility, highlighting the practical implications of our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>High Dimensional Binary Choice Model with Unknown Heteroskedasticity or Instrumental Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for estimating high-dimensional binary choice models. We consider a semiparametric model that places no distributional assumptions on the error term, allows for heteroskedastic errors, and permits endogenous regressors. Our approaches extend the special regressor estimator originally proposed by Lewbel (2000). This estimator becomes impractical in high-dimensional settings due to the curse of dimensionality associated with high-dimensional conditional density estimation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce an innovative data-driven dimension reduction method for nonparametric kernel estimators, which constitutes the main contribution of this work. The method combines distance covariance-based screening with cross-validation (CV) procedures, making special regressor estimation feasible in high dimensions. Using this new feasible conditional density estimator, we address variable and moment (instrumental variable) selection problems for these models. We apply penalized least squares (LS) and generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators with an L1 penalty. A comprehensive analysis of the oracle and asymptotic properties of these estimators is provided. Finally, through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical study on the migration intentions of rural Chinese residents, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in finite sample settings.</description>

      <title>Continuous difference-in-differences with double/debiased machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends difference-in-differences to settings with continuous treatments. Specifically, the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) at any level of treatment intensity is identified under a conditional parallel trends assumption. Estimating the ATT in this framework requires first estimating infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, particularly the conditional density of the continuous treatment, which can introduce substantial bias. To address this challenge, we propose estimators for the causal parameters under the double/debiased machine learning framework and establish their asymptotic normality. Additionally, we provide consistent variance estimators and construct uniform confidence bands based on a multiplier bootstrap procedure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our estimators to the 1983 Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS) reform studied by Acemoglu and Finkelstein (2008), reframing it as a DiD with continuous treatment and nonparametrically estimating its effects.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Randomization Tests for Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Researchers are often interested in the existence and extent of interference between units when conducting causal inference or designing policy. However, testing for interference presents significant econometric challenges, particularly due to complex clustering patterns and dependencies that can invalidate standard methods. This paper introduces the pairwise imputation-based randomization test (PIRT), a general and robust framework for assessing the existence and extent of interference in experimental settings. PIRT employs unconditional randomization testing and pairwise comparisons, enabling straightforward implementation and ensuring finite-sample validity under minimal assumptions about network structure. The method's practical value is demonstrated through an application to a large-scale policing experiment in Bogota, Colombia (Blattman et al., 2021), which evaluates the effects of hotspot policing on crime at the street segment level. The analysis reveals that increased police patrolling in hotspots significantly displaces violent crime, but not property crime. Simulations calibrated to this context further underscore the power and robustness of PIRT.</description>

      <title>Spatial Competition on Psychological Pricing Strategies -- Preliminary Evidence from an Online Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether spatial proximity shapes psychological-pricing choices on Austria's C2C marketplace willhaben. Two web-scraped snapshots of 826 Woom Bike listings - a standardised product sold on the platform reveal that sellers near direct competitors are more likely to adopt 9-, 90-, or 99-ending prices, who also use such pricing strategy unconditional on product characteristics or underlying spatiotemporal differences. Such strategy is associated with an average premium of approximately cet. par. 3.4 %. Information asymmetry persists: buyer trust hinges on signals such as the "Trusted Seller" badge, and missing data on the "PayLivery" feature. Lacking final transaction prices limits inference.</description>

      <title>Moment Restrictions for Nonlinear Panel Data Models with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many panel data methods, while allowing for general dependence between covariates and time-invariant agent-specific heterogeneity, place strong a priori restrictions on feedback: how past outcomes, covariates, and heterogeneity map into future covariate levels. Ruling out feedback entirely, as often occurs in practice, is unattractive in many dynamic economic settings. We provide a general characterization of all feedback and heterogeneity robust (FHR) moment conditions for nonlinear panel data models and present constructive methods to derive feasible moment-based estimators for specific models. We also use our moment characterization to compute semiparametric efficiency bounds, allowing for a quantification of the information loss associated with accommodating feedback, as well as providing insight into how to construct estimators with good efficiency properties in practice. Our results apply both to the finite dimensional parameter indexing the parametric part of the model as well as to estimands that involve averages over the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. We illustrate our methods by providing a complete characterization of all FHR moment functions in the multi-spell mixed proportional hazards model. We compute efficient moment functions for both model parameters and average effects in this setting.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Copulas for Capital Modelling and Systemic Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of copulas that we call Principal Component Copulas (PCCs). This class combines the strong points of copula-based techniques with principal component analysis (PCA), which results in flexibility when modelling tail dependence along the most important directions in high-dimensional data. We obtain theoretical results for PCCs that are important for practical applications. In particular, we derive tractable expressions for the high-dimensional copula density, which can be represented in terms of characteristic functions. We also develop algorithms to perform Maximum Likelihood and Generalized Method of Moment estimation in high-dimensions and show very good performance in simulation experiments. Finally, we apply the copula to the international stock market to study systemic risk. We find that PCCs lead to excellent performance on measures of systemic risk due to their ability to distinguish between parallel and orthogonal movements in the global market, which have a different impact on systemic risk and diversification. As a result, we consider the PCC promising for capital models, which financial institutions use to protect themselves against systemic risk.</description>

      <title>A Test for Jumps in Metric-Space Conditional Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard methods for detecting discontinuities in conditional means are not applicable to outcomes that are complex, non-Euclidean objects like distributions, networks, or covariance matrices. This article develops a nonparametric test for jumps in conditional means when outcomes lie in a non-Euclidean metric space. Using local Fr\'echet regression, the method estimates a mean path on either side of a candidate cutoff. This extends existing $k$-sample tests to a non-parametric regression setting with metric-space valued outcomes. I establish the asymptotic distribution of the test and its consistency against contiguous alternatives. For this, I derive a central limit theorem for the local estimator of the conditional Fr\'echet variance and a consistent estimator of its asymptotic variance. Simulations confirm nominal size control and robust power in finite samples. Two empirical illustrations demonstrate the method's ability to reveal discontinuities missed by scalar-based tests. I find sharp changes in (i) work-from-home compositions at an income threshold for non-compete enforceability and (ii) national input-output networks following the loss of preferential U.S. trade access. These findings show the value of analyzing regression outcomes in their native metric spaces.</description>
