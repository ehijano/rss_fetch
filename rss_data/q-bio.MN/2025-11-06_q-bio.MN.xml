      <title>A Gene Ranking Framework Enhances the Design Efficiency of Genome-Scale Constraint-Based Metabolic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of genome-scale constraint-based metabolic networks has steadily advanced, with an increasing number of successful cases achieving growth-coupled production, in which the biosynthesis of key metabolites is linked to cell growth. However, a major cause of design failures is the inability to find solutions within realistic time limits. Therefore, it is essential to develop methods that achieve a high success rate within the specified computation time. In this study, we propose a framework for ranking the importance of individual genes to accelerate the solution of the original mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems in the design of constraint-based models. In the proposed method, after pre-assigning values to highly important genes, the MILPs are solved in parallel as a series of mutually exclusive subproblems. It is found that our framework was able to recover most of the successful cases identified by the original approach and achieved a 37% to 186% increase in success rate compared to the original method within the same time limits. Analysis of the MILP solution process revealed that the proposed method reduced the sizes of subproblems and decreased the number of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree. This framework for ranking gene importance can be directly applicable to a range of MILP-based algorithms for the design of constraint-based metabolic networks. The developed scripts are available on https://github.com/MetNetComp/Gene-Ranked-RatGene.</description>

      <title>DiffSpectra: Molecular Structure Elucidation from Spectra using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular structure elucidation from spectra is a fundamental challenge in molecular science. Conventional approaches rely heavily on expert interpretation and lack scalability, while retrieval-based machine learning approaches remain constrained by limited reference libraries. Generative models offer a promising alternative, yet most adopt autoregressive architectures that overlook 3D geometry and struggle to integrate diverse spectral modalities. In this work, we present DiffSpectra, a generative framework that formulates molecular structure elucidation as a conditional generation process, directly inferring 2D and 3D molecular structures from multi-modal spectra using diffusion models. Its denoising network is parameterized by the Diffusion Molecule Transformer, an SE(3)-equivariant architecture for geometric modeling, conditioned by SpecFormer, a Transformer-based spectral encoder capturing multi-modal spectral dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffSpectra accurately elucidates molecular structures, achieving 40.76% top-1 and 99.49% top-10 accuracy. Its performance benefits substantially from 3D geometric modeling, SpecFormer pre-training, and multi-modal conditioning. To our knowledge, DiffSpectra is the first framework that unifies multi-modal spectral reasoning and joint 2D/3D generative modeling for de novo molecular structure elucidation.</description>
