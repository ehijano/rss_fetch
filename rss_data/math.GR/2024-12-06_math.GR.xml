      <title>Decomposition of matrices from $SL_ 2(K[x, y])$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$ the polynomial ring. The group $\text{SL}_{2}\left(\mathbb{K}[x,y]\right)$ of all matrices with determinant equal to $1$ over $\mathbb{K}[x,y]$ can not be generated by elementary matrices. The known counterexample was pointed out by P.M. Cohn. Conversely, A.A.Suslin proved that the group $\text{SL}_{r}\left(\mathbb{K}[x_{1},\dots,x_{n}]\right)$ is generated by elementary matrices for $r\ge 3$ and arbitrary $n\geq 2$, the same is true for $n=1$ and arbitrary $r.$ It is proven that any matrix from $\text{SL}_{2}\left(\mathbb{K}[x,y]\right)$ with at least one entry of degree $\le 2$ is either a product of elementary matrices or a product of elementary matrices and of a matrix similar to the one pointed out by P. Cohn. For any matrix $\begin{pmatrix}\begin{array}{cc} f &amp; g\\ -Q &amp; P \end{array}\end{pmatrix}\in\text{SL}_{2}\left(\mathbb{K}[x,y]\right)$, we obtain formulas for the homogeneous components $P_i , Q_i$ for the unimodular row $(-Q, P) $ as combinations of homogeneous components of the polynomials $f, g, $ respectively, with the same coefficients.</description>

      <title>Eventually Self-Similar Groups acting on Fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing work by Belk and Forrest, we develop almost expanding hyperedge replacement systems that build fractal topological spaces as quotients of edge shifts under certain ``gluing'' equivalent relations. We define ESS groups, which are groups of homeomorphisms of these spaces that act as a finitary asynchronous transformations followed by self-similar ones, akin to the action of Scott-R\"{o}ver-Nekrashevych groups on the Cantor space. We provide sufficient conditions for finiteness properties of such groups, which allow us to show that the airplane and dendrite rearrangement groups have type $F_\infty$, that a group combining dendrite rearrangements and the Grigorchuk group is finitely generated, and that certain ESS groups of edge shifts have type $F_\infty$ (partially addressing a question of Deaconu), in addition to providing new proofs of previously known results about several Thompson-like groups.</description>

      <title>The diagonal $p$-permutation functor $kR_k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic $p$. We describe the full lattice of subfunctors of the diagonal $p$-permutation functor $kR_k$ obtained by $k$-linear extension from the functor $R_k$ of linear representations over $k$. This leads to the description of the ``composition factors'' $S_P$ of $kR_k$, which are parametrized by finite $p$-groups (up to isomorphism), and of the evaluations of these particular simple diagonal $p$-permutation functors over $k$.</description>

      <title>A Presentation for the Outer Automorphism Group of a Free Product with No Free Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a concise presentation for the outer automorphism group of a free product with no free rank, whose factors are non-trivial, freely indecomposable, not infinite cyclic, and pairwise non-isomorphic. This is achieved by considering the action of the outer automorphism group on a particular subcomplex of `Outer Space', which we show to be simply connected. We then apply a theorem of K. S. Brown to extract our presentation.</description>

      <title>Short hierarchically hyperbolic groups II: quotients and the Hopf property for Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that most Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type are Hopfian, meaning that every self-epimorphism is an isomorphism. The class covered by our result is generic, in the sense of Goldsborough-Vaskou. Moreover, assuming the residual finiteness of certain hyperbolic groups with an explicit presentation, we get that all large and hyperbolic type Artin groups are residually finite. We also show that most quotients of the five-holed sphere mapping class group are hierarchically hyperbolic, up to taking powers of the normal generators of the kernels. The main tool we use to prove both results is a Dehn-filling-like procedure for short hierarchically hyperbolic groups (these also include e.g. non-geometric 3-manifolds, and triangle- and square-free RAAGs).</description>

      <title>Twisted right-angled Artin groups embedded in knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted right-angled Artin groups are defined through presentation based on mixed graphs. Each vertex corresponds to a generator, each undirected edge yields a commuting relation and each directed edge gives a Klein bottle relation. If there is no directed edge, then this reduces to an ordinary right-angled Artin group.
  There is a characterization of right-angled Artin groups which can be embedded in knot groups by Katayama. In this paper, we completely determine twisted right-angled Artin groups embedded in knot groups.</description>

      <title>Enveloping Ellis semigroups as compactifications of transformations groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of a proper Ellis semigroup compactification is introduced. Ellis's functional approach shows how to obtain them from totally bounded equiuniformities on a phase space $X$ when the acting group $G$ is with the topology of pointwise convergence and the $G$-space $(G, X, \curvearrowright)$ is $G$-Tychonoff.
  The correspondence between proper Ellis semigroup compactifications of a topological group and special totally bounded equiuniformities (called Ellis equiuniformities) on a topological group is established. The Ellis equiuniformity on a topological transformation group $G$ from the maximal equiuniformity on a phase space $G/H$ in the case of its uniformly equicontinuous action is compared with Roelcke uniformity on $G$.
  Proper Ellis semigroup compactifications are described for groups $S\,(X)$ (the permutation group of a discrete space $X$) and $Aut\,(X)$ (automorphism group of an ultrahomogeneous chain $X$) in the permutation topology. It is shown that this approach can be applied to the unitary group of a Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>The non-commuting, non-generating graph of a finite simple group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01616v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group such that $G/Z(G)$ is finite and simple. The non-commuting, non-generating graph $\Xi(G)$ of $G$ has vertex set $G \setminus Z(G)$, with edges corresponding to pairs of elements that do not commute and do not generate $G$. Complementing our previous investigation of this graph for non-simple groups, we show that $\Xi(G)$ is connected with diameter at most $5$, with smaller upper bounds for certain families of groups. Using these bounds, we then prove that when $G$ is simple, the diameter of the complement of the generating graph of $G$ has a tight upper bound of $4$, with the exception of at most one group with a graph of diameter $5$.</description>

      <title>Twist equivalence for Nichols algebras over Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bazlov generalized the construction of Fomin-Kirillov algebras to arbitrary finite Coxeter groups. They are quadratic approximations of Nichols algebras associated with the conjugacy class of reflections and a (rack) 2-cocycle q^+ with values in {-1,1}. We prove that q^+ is twist-equivalent to the constant cocycle q^-=-1, generalising a result of Vendramin. As a consequence, the Nichols algebras associated with the two different cocycles have the same Hilbert series and one is quadratic if and only if the other is quadratic. We further apply a recent result of Heckenberger, Meir and Vendramin and Andruskiewitsch, Heckenberger and Vendramin to complete the missing cases in the classification of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over the dihedral groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if all the finite coset spaces of a polycyclic group have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size then the group is virtually nilpotent. We obtain the same conclusion for a finitely generated residually torsion-free nilpotent group under the weaker assumption that the finite quotient groups have diameter bounded uniformly below by a polynomial in their size. This extends work of Khukhro and Valette.</description>

      <title>Non-arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds attached to unitary Shimura varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.01598v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new method of constructing non-arithmetic lattices in the projective orthogonal group $\text{PO}(n,1)$ for every integer $n$ larger than one. The technique is to consider anti-holomorphic involutions on a complex arithmetic ball quotient, glue their fixed loci along geodesic subspaces, and show that the resulting metric space carries canonically the structure of a complete real hyperbolic orbifold. The volume of various of these non-arithmetic orbifolds can be explicitly calculated.</description>
