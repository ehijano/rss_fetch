      <title>Technical Note: Vendor-Specific Approach for Standardized Uptake Value Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is a critical metric in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, used to assess metabolic activity. However, calculating SUV from DICOM files presents challenges due to vendor-specific DICOM attributes and variations in the encoding of radiotracer accumulation times. This technical note introduces a robust, vendor-specific SUV calculation strategy that addresses inconsistencies in current methodologies. We also integrate this strategy into an open-source software solution, Z-Rad, capable of converting raw PET DICOM data into body-weight normalized SUV NIfTI files.
  Our SUV calculation strategy was developed by reviewing DICOM conformance statements from GE, Philips, and Siemens. Validation was conducted using real-world PET datasets, and the proposed strategy was compared to existing software solutions.
  Our SUV calculation approach demonstrated improved accuracy, particularly in resolving time-related discrepancies in the studied data. Our analysis also identified inconsistencies in the SUV calculation methods used by popular commercial and open-source software solutions, which do not fully account for vendor-specific DICOM attributes and PET image acquisition times. These limitations resulted in errors in SUV estimation reaching 33\% when comparing our strategy to studied software.
  The proposed vendor-specific SUV calculation strategy significantly enhances accuracy in PET imaging by addressing key inconsistencies caused by variations in DICOM attributes and image acquisition times across different vendors. This method effectively reduces SUV calculation errors and has been integrated into an open-source software, Z-Rad.</description>

      <title>UMambaAdj: Advancing GTV Segmentation for Head and Neck Cancer in MRI-Guided RT with UMamba and nnU-Net ResEnc Planner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) due to its superior soft-tissue contrast. However, accurately segmenting the gross tumor volume (GTV), which includes both the primary tumor (GTVp) and lymph nodes (GTVn), remains challenging. Recently, two deep learning segmentation innovations have shown great promise: UMamba, which effectively captures long-range dependencies, and the nnU-Net Residual Encoder (ResEnc), which enhances feature extraction through multistage residual blocks. In this study, we integrate these strengths into a novel approach, termed 'UMambaAdj'. Our proposed method was evaluated on the HNTS-MRG 2024 challenge test set using pre-RT T2-weighted MRI images, achieving an aggregated Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSCagg) of 0.751 for GTVp and 0.842 for GTVn, with a mean DSCagg of 0.796. This approach demonstrates potential for more precise tumor delineation in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy, ultimately improving treatment outcomes for HNC patients.

      <title>Gradient Map-Assisted Head and Neck Tumor Segmentation: A Pre-RT to Mid-RT Approach in MRI-Guided Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation therapy (RT) is a vital part of treatment for head and neck cancer, where accurate segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) is essential for effective treatment planning. This study investigates the use of pre-RT tumor regions and local gradient maps to enhance mid-RT tumor segmentation for head and neck cancer in MRI-guided adaptive radiotherapy. By leveraging pre-RT images and their segmentations as prior knowledge, we address the challenge of tumor localization in mid-RT segmentation. A gradient map of the tumor region from the pre-RT image is computed and applied to mid-RT images to improve tumor boundary delineation. Our approach demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy for both primary GTV (GTVp) and nodal GTV (GTVn), though performance was limited by data constraints. The final DSCagg scores from the challenge's test set evaluation were 0.534 for GTVp, 0.867 for GTVn, and a mean score of 0.70. This method shows potential for enhancing segmentation and treatment planning in adaptive radiotherapy. Team: DCPT-Stine's group.</description>

      <title>On the new and accurate (Goudsmit-Saunderson) model for describing e-/e+ multiple Coulomb scattering (Geant4 Technical Note)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new model, for the accurate simulation of multiple Coulomb scattering (MSC) of e-/e+, has been implemented in Geant4 recently and made available with version Geant4-10.4. The model is based on Goudsmit-Saunderson (GS) angular distributions computed by utilising the screen Rutherford (SR) DCS and follows very closely the formulation developed by Kawrakow [1, 2] and utilised in the EGSnrc toolkit [3]. Corrections, for taking into accountenergy loss [2] neglected by the GS theory, spin-relativistic effects [3] not included in the SR but might be accounted on the basis of Mott DCS as well as the so-called scattering power correction [4], i.e. appropriately incorporating deflections due to sub-threshold delta ray productions, are all included similarly to the EGSnrc model [3]. Furthermore, an accurate electron-step algorithm [5, 6, 2] is utilised for path length correction, i.e. for calculating the post-step position in each condensed history simulation steps such that the corresponding single-scattering longitudinal and lateral (post step point) distributions are very well reproduced. An e-/e+ stepping algorithm, including the simulation step-limit due to the MSC and boundary crossing [2]), free from step-size artefacts, makes the model complete. Details on this new model, including all the above-mentioned components and corrections, are provided in this Geant4 technical note.
  It must be noted, that a Goudsmit-Saunderson model for MSC was available before Geant4-10.4., documented in [7], that has been completely replaced by the model described in this technical note (keeping only the G4GoudsmitSaundersonMscModel name of the C++ class from that previous version)</description>

      <title>In-vivo high-resolution \chi-separation at 7T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently introduced quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) technique, $\chi$-separation, offers the capability to separate paramagnetic ($\chi_{\text{para}}$) and diamagnetic ($\chi_{\text{dia}}$) susceptibility distribution within the brain. In-vivo high-resolution mapping of iron and myelin distribution, estimated by $\chi$-separation, could provide a deeper understanding of brain substructures, assisting the investigation of their functions and alterations. This can be achieved using 7T MRI, which benefits from a high signal-to-noise ratio and susceptibility effects. However, applying $\chi$-separation at 7T presents difficulties due to the requirement of an $R_2$ map, coupled with issues such as high specific absorption rate (SAR), large $B_1$ transmit field inhomogeneities, and prolonged scan time.
  To address these challenges, we developed a novel deep neural network, R2PRIMEnet7T, designed to convert a 7T $R_2^*$ map into a 3T $R_2'$ map. Building on this development, we present a new pipeline for $\chi$-separation at 7T, enabling us to generate high-resolution $\chi$-separation maps from multi-echo gradient-echo data. The proposed method is compared with alternative pipelines, such as an end-to-end network and linearly-scaled $R_2'$, and is validated against $\chi$-separation maps at 3T, demonstrating its accuracy. The 7T $\chi$-separation maps generated by the proposed method exhibit similar contrasts to those from 3T, while 7T high-resolution maps offer enhanced clarity and detail. Quantitative analysis confirms that the proposed method surpasses the alternative pipelines. The proposed method results well delineate the detailed brain structures associated with iron and myelin. This new pipeline holds promise for analyzing iron and myelin concentration changes in various neurodegenerative diseases through precise structural examination.</description>
