      <title>Deciphering Complexity: Machine Learning Insights into Chaotic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new machine-learning techniques for analyzing chaotic dynamical systems. The primary objectives of the study include the development of a new and simple method for calculating the Lyapunov exponent using only two trajectory data points unlike traditional methods that require an averaging procedure, the exploration of phase transition graphs from regular periodic to chaotic dynamics to identify "almost integrable" trajectories where conserved quantities deviate from whole numbers, and the identification of "integrable regions" within chaotic trajectories. These methods are applied and tested on two dynamical systems: "Two objects moving on a rod" and the "Henon-Heiles" systems.</description>

      <title>Rich dynamical behaviors from a digital reversal operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operation that maps one natural number to another can be considered as a dynamical system in $\mathbb{N}^+$. Some of such systems, e.g. the mapping in the so-called 3x+1 problem proposed by Collatz, is conjectured to have a single global attractor, whereas other systems, e.g. linear congruence, could be ergodic. Here we demonstrate that an operation that is based on digital reversal, has a spectrum of dynamical behaviors, including 2-cycle, 12-cycle, periodic attractors with other cycle lengths, and diverging limiting dynamics that escape to infinity. This dynamical system has infinite number of cyclic attractors, and may have unlimited number of cycle lengths. It also has potentially infinite number of diverging trajectories with a recurrent pattern repeating every 8 steps. Although the transient time before settling on a limiting dynamics is relatively short, we speculate that transient times may not have an upper bound.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Behavior of Origami Structures: Computational and Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Origami structures have been receiving a lot of attention from engineering and scientific researchers owing to their unique properties such as deployability, multi-stability, negative stiffness, etc. However, dynamic properties of origami structures have not been explored much due to a lack of validated analytical dynamic modeling approaches. Given the range of interesting properties and applications of origami structures, it is important to study the dynamic behavior of origami structures. In this study, a dynamic modeling approach for origami structures is presented considering distributed mass modeling, which has the potential to be a generalizable approach. In the proposed approach, stiffness is modeled using the bar and hinge modeling approach while the mass is modeled using the mass distribution approach. Various candidate mass distribution approaches were investigated by comparing their responses to the finite element method responses for various geometric conditions, loading and boundary conditions, and deformation modes. It was observed that a dynamic modeling approach with triangle circumcenter mass distribution was able to capture most of the dynamics satisfactorily consistently. Subsequently, a Miura-ori specimen was manufactured and its free vibration response was determined experimentally and then compared to the prediction of the analytical model. The comparison demonstrated that the analytical model was able to capture most of the dynamics in the longitudinal direction.</description>

      <title>Efficient coding with chaotic neural networks: A journey from neuroscience to physics and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This essay, derived from a lecture at "The Physics Modeling of Thought" workshop in Berlin in winter 2023, explores the mutually beneficial relationship between theoretical neuroscience and statistical physics through the lens of efficient coding and computation in cortical circuits. It highlights how the study of neural networks has enhanced our understanding of complex, nonequilibrium, and disordered systems, while also demonstrating how neuroscientific challenges have spurred novel developments in physics. The paper traces the evolution of ideas from seminal work on chaos in random neural networks to recent developments in efficient coding and the partial suppression of chaotic fluctuations. It emphasizes how concepts from statistical physics, such as phase transitions and critical phenomena, have been instrumental in elucidating the computational capabilities of neural networks.
  By examining the interplay between order and disorder in neural computation, the essay illustrates the deep connection between theoretical neuroscience and the statistical physics of nonequilibrium systems. This synthesis underscores the ongoing importance of interdisciplinary approaches in advancing both fields, offering fresh perspectives on the fundamental principles governing information processing in biological and artificial systems. This multidisciplinary approach not only advances our understanding of neural computation and complex systems but also points toward future challenges at the intersection of neuroscience and physics.</description>

      <title>Networks of Pendula with Diffusive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of coupled pendula with diffusive interactions, which could depend both on positions and on momenta. The coupling structure is defined by an undirected network, while the dynamic equations are derived from a Hamiltonian; as such, the energy is conserved. We provide sufficient conditions on the energy for bounded motion, identifying the oscillatory regime. We also describe the bifurcations of synchronised states, exploiting the quantities related to the network structure. Moreover, we consider patterns of anti-synchrony arising from the specific properties of the model. Such patterns can be linked to global properties of the system by looking at motion of the centre of mass. Nonetheless, the anti-synchrony patterns play also a relevant role in the bifurcation analysis. For the case of graphs with a large number of nodes, we characterise the parameter range in which the bifurcations occur. We complement the analysis with some numerical simulations showing the interplay between bifurcations of the origin and transitions to chaos of nearby orbits. A key feature is that the observed chaotic regime emerges at low energies.</description>

      <title>Learning the Latent dynamics of Fluid flows from High-Fidelity Numerical Simulations using Parsimonious Diffusion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use parsimonious diffusion maps (PDMs) to discover the latent dynamics of high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations with a focus on the 2D fluidic pinball problem. By varying the Reynolds number, different flow regimes emerge, ranging from steady symmetric flows to quasi-periodic asymmetric and turbulence. We show, that the proposed non-linear manifold learning scheme, identifies in a crisp manner the expected intrinsic dimension of the underlying emerging dynamics over the parameter space. In particular, PDMs, estimate that the emergent dynamics in the oscillatory regime can be captured by just two variables, while in the chaotic regime, the dominant modes are three as anticipated by the normal form theory. On the other hand, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)/PCA, most commonly used for dimensionality reduction in fluid mechanics, does not provide such a crisp separation between the dominant modes. To validate the performance of PDMs, we also computed the reconstruction error, by constructing a decoder using Geometric Harmonics. We show that the proposed scheme outperforms the POD/PCA over the whole Reynolds number range. Thus, we believe that the proposed scheme will allow for the development of more accurate reduced order models for high-fidelity fluid dynamics simulators, thus relaxing the curse of dimensionality in numerical analysis tasks such as bifurcation analysis, optimization and control.</description>

      <title>Chaotic properties for billiards in circular polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study billiards in domains enclosed by circular polygons. These are closed $C^1$ strictly convex curves formed by finitely many circular arcs. We prove the existence of a set in phase space, corresponding to generic sliding trajectories close enough to the boundary of the domain, in which the return billiard dynamics is semiconjugate to a transitive subshift on infinitely many symbols that contains the full $N$-shift as a topological factor for any $N \in \mathbb{N}$, so it has infinite topological entropy. We prove the existence of uncountably many asymptotic generic sliding trajectories approaching the boundary with optimal uniform linear speed, give an explicit exponentially big (in $q$) lower bound on the number of $q$-periodic trajectories as $q \to \infty$, and present an unusual property of the length spectrum. Our proofs are entirely analytical.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Linearization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its variants, such as extended DMD (EDMD), are broadly used to fit simple linear models to dynamical systems known from observable data. As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.</description>
