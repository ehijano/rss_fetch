      <title>Probabilistic Sensing: Intelligence in Data Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the intelligence of sensors to the data-acquisition process - deciding whether to sample or not - can result in transformative energy-efficiency gains. However, making such a decision in a deterministic manner involves risk of losing information. Here we present a sensing paradigm that enables making such a decision in a probabilistic manner. The paradigm takes inspiration from the autonomous nervous system and employs a probabilistic neuron (p-neuron) driven by an analog feature extraction circuit. The response time of the system is on the order of microseconds, over-coming the sub-sampling-rate response time limit and enabling real-time intelligent autonomous activation of data-sampling. Validation experiments on active seismic survey data demonstrate lossless probabilistic data acquisition, with a normalized mean squared error of 0.41%, and 93% saving in the active operation time of the system and the number of generated samples.</description>

      <title>PASS: Ambiguity Guided Subsets for Scalable Classical and Quantum Constrained Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairwise-constrained clustering augments unsupervised partitioning with side information by enforcing must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraints between specific samples, yielding labelings that respect known affinities and separations. However, ML and CL constraints add an extra layer of complexity to the clustering problem, with current methods struggling in data scalability, especially in niche applications like quantum or quantum-hybrid clustering. We propose PASS, a pairwise-constraints and ambiguity-driven subset selection framework that preserves ML and CL constraints satisfaction while allowing scalable, high-quality clustering solution. PASS collapses ML constraints into pseudo-points and offers two selectors: a constraint-aware margin rule that collects near-boundary points and all detected CL violations, and an information-geometric rule that scores points via a Fisher-Rao distance derived from soft assignment posteriors, then selects the highest-information subset under a simple budget. Across diverse benchmarks, PASS attains competitive SSE at substantially lower cost than exact or penalty-based methods, and remains effective in regimes where prior approaches fail.</description>

      <title>On the Impact of AGENTS.md Files on the Efficiency of AI Coding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI coding agents such as Codex and Claude Code are increasingly used to autonomously contribute to software repositories. However, little is known about how repository-level configuration artifacts affect operational efficiency of the agents. In this paper, we study the impact of AGENTS.md files on the runtime and token consumption of AI coding agents operating on GitHub pull requests. We analyze 10 repositories and 124 pull requests, executing agents under two conditions: with and without an AGENTS.md file. We measure wall-clock execution time and token usage during agent execution. Our results show that the presence of AGENTS.md is associated with a lower median runtime ($\Delta 28.64$%) and reduced output token consumption ($\Delta 16.58$%), while maintaining a comparable task completion behavior. Based on these results, we discuss immediate implications for the configuration and deployment of AI coding agents in practice, and outline a broader research agenda on the role of repository-level instructions in shaping the behavior, efficiency, and integration of AI coding agents in software development workflows.</description>

      <title>Dependable Connectivity for Industrial Wireless Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dependability - a system's ability to consistently provide reliable services by ensuring safety and maintainability in the face of internal or external disruptions - is a fundamental requirement for industrial wireless communication networks (IWCNs). While 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) addresses some aspects of this challenge, its evolution toward holistic dependability in 6G must encompass reliability, availability, safety, and security. This paper provides a comprehensive framework for dependable IWCNs, bridging theory and practice. We first establish the theoretical foundations of dependability, including outlining its key attributes and presenting analytical tools to study it. Next, we explore practical enablers, such as adaptive multiple access schemes leveraging real-time monitoring and time-sensitive networking to ensure end-to-end determinism. A case study demonstrates how intelligent wake-up protocols improve event detection probability by orders of magnitude compared to conventional duty cycling. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions for a 6G-driven dependable IWCN.</description>

      <title>/dev/SDB: Software Defined Boot -- A novel standard for diskless booting anywhere and everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A computer is nothing but a device that processes the instructions supplied to it. However, as computers evolved, the instructions or codes started to be more complicated. As computers started to be used by non-technical people, it became imperative that the users be able to use the machine without having underlying knowledge of the code or the hardware. And operating system became the backbone for translating the inputs from the user to actual operation on the hardware. With the increasing complexity and the choices of operating system, it became clear that different groups of people, especially in an enterprise scenario, required different operating systems. Installing them all on a single machine, for shared computers became a difficult task, giving rise to network-based booting. But network-based booting was confined to only wired connectivity, keeping it restricted to very small geographical areas. The proposed system, /dev/SDB, is aimed at creating a standard where any user, anyone on the globe, can access the operating system authorized to them without having to be on the corporate network. It aims to offer the same over Wi-Fi as well as cellular connectivity, ensuring employees can truly work from anywhere, while following the policies for operating systems and without redundant hardware.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Identity in Practice: Benchmarking Latency, Cost, and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are increasingly deployed on distributed ledgers, yet systematic cross-platform evidence on their operational behavior remains limited. We present an empirical benchmarking study of three prominent ledger-based DID methods - Ethereum, Hedera, and XRP Ledger - using reference Software Development Kits (SDKs) under a unified experimental setup. We measure latency, transaction cost, and on-chain metadata exposure, normalizing latency by each platform's block or consensus interval and cost by its native value transfer fee. Privacy leakage is quantified using a Metadata-Leakage Score (MLS), an entropy-based measure expressed in bits per operation.
  Our results reveal distinct architectural trade-offs. Ethereum enables near-instant, off-chain DID creation, but incurs the highest latency and cost for on-chain lifecycle operations. XRPL delivers deterministic and stable latency with fixed, low fees, yet exhibits higher metadata leakage due to more verbose transaction payloads. Hedera achieves the lowest on-chain latency and low fees with minimal metadata leakage, while occasional variance arises from SDK-side processing and confirmation pipelines.
  Overall, the findings show that ledger architecture and SDK workflows play a major role in shaping DID latency, cost, and metadata exposure, complementing the effects of the underlying consensus mechanism. These results provide evidence-based insights to support informed selection and configuration of DID systems under performance and privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>DoubleAgents: Interactive Simulations for Alignment in Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic workflows promise efficiency, but adoption hinges on whether people can align systems that act on their behalf with their goals, values, and situational expectations. We present DoubleAgents, an agentic planning tool that embeds transparency and control through user intervention, value-reflecting policies, rich state visualizations, and uncertainty flagging for human coordination tasks. A built-in respondent simulation generates realistic scenarios, allowing users to rehearse and refine policies and calibrate their use of agentic behavior before live deployment. We evaluate DoubleAgents in a two-day lab study (n = 10), three deployment studies, and a technical evaluation. Results show that participants initially hesitated to delegate but used simulation to probe system behavior and adjust policies, gradually increasing delegation as agent actions became better aligned with their intentions and context. Deployment results demonstrate DoubleAgents' real-world relevance and usefulness, showing that simulation helps users effectively manage real-world tasks with higher complexity and uncertainty. We contribute interactive simulation as a practical pathway for users to iteratively align and calibrate agentic systems.</description>
