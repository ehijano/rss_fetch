      <title>Embedding Radiomics into Vision Transformers for Multimodal Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning has significantly advanced medical image analysis, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) offering a powerful alternative to convolutional models by modeling long-range dependencies through self-attention. However, ViTs are inherently data-intensive and lack domain-specific inductive biases, limiting their applicability in medical imaging. In contrast, radiomics provides interpretable, handcrafted descriptors of tissue heterogeneity but suffers from limited scalability and integration into end-to-end learning frameworks. In this work, we propose the Radiomics-Embedded Vision Transformer (RE-ViT) that combines radiomic features with data-driven visual embeddings within a ViT backbone.
  Purpose: To develop a hybrid RE-ViT framework that integrates radiomics and patch-wise ViT embeddings through early fusion, enhancing robustness and performance in medical image classification.
  Methods: Following the standard ViT pipeline, images were divided into patches. For each patch, handcrafted radiomic features were extracted and fused with linearly projected pixel embeddings. The fused representations were normalized, positionally encoded, and passed to the ViT encoder. A learnable [CLS] token aggregated patch-level information for classification. We evaluated RE-ViT on three public datasets (including BUSI, ChestXray2017, and Retinal OCT) using accuracy, macro AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. RE-ViT was benchmarked against CNN-based (VGG-16, ResNet) and hybrid (TransMed) models.
  Results: RE-ViT achieved state-of-the-art results: on BUSI, AUC=0.950+/-0.011; on ChestXray2017, AUC=0.989+/-0.004; on Retinal OCT, AUC=0.986+/-0.001, which outperforms other comparison models.
  Conclusions: The RE-ViT framework effectively integrates radiomics with ViT architectures, demonstrating improved performance and generalizability across multimodal medical image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Clinically Interpretable Survival Risk Stratification in Head and Neck Cancer Using Bayesian Networks and Markov Blankets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To identify a clinically interpretable subset of survival-relevant features in HN cancer using Bayesian Network (BN) and evaluate its prognostic and causal utility. Methods and Materials: We used the RADCURE dataset, consisting of 3,346 patients with H&amp;N cancer treated with definitive (chemo)radiotherapy. A probabilistic BN was constructed to model dependencies among clinical, anatomical, and treatment variables. The Markov Blanket (MB) of two-year survival (SVy2) was extracted and used to train a logistic regression model. After excluding incomplete cases, a temporal split yielded a train/test (2,174/820) dataset using 2007 as the cutoff year. Model performance was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC), C-index, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival stratification. Model fit was further evaluated using a log-likelihood ratio (LLR) test. Causal inference was performed using do-calculus interventions on MB variables. Results: The MB of SVy2 included 6 clinically relevant features: ECOG performance status, T-stage, HPV status, disease site, the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp), and treatment modality. The model achieved an AUC of 0.65 and C-index of 0.78 on the test dataset, significantly stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups (log-rank p &lt; 0.01). Model fit was further supported by a log-likelihood ratio of 70.32 (p &lt; 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed strong performance in HPV-negative (AUC = 0.69, C-index = 0.76), T4 (AUC = 0.69, C-index = 0.80), and large-GTV (AUC = 0.67, C-index = 0.75) cohorts, each showing significant KM separation. Causal analysis further supported the positive survival impact of ECOG 0, HPV-positive status, and chemoradiation. Conclusions: A compact, MB-derived BN model can robustly stratify survival risk in HN cancer. The model enables explainable prognostication and supports individualized decision-making across key clinical subgroups.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Compton-PET Imaging for ion-range verification:A Preclinical Study for Proton-, Helium-, and Carbon-Therapy at HIT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced-accuracy ion-range verification in real time shall enable a significant step forward in the use of therapeutic ion beams. Positron-emission tomography (PET) and prompt-gamma imaging (PGI) are two of the most promising and researched methodologies, both of them with their own advantages and challenges. Thus far, both of them have been explored for ion-range verification in an independent way. However, the simultaneous combination of PET and PGI within the same imaging framework may open-up the possibility to exploit more efficiently all radiative emissions excited in the tissue by the ion beam. Here we report on the first pre-clinical implementation of an hybrid PET-PGI imaging system, hereby exploring its performance over several ion-beam species (H, He and C), energies (55 MeV to 275 MeV) and intensities (10$^7$-10$^9$ ions/spot), which are representative of clinical conditions. The measurements were carried out using the pencil-beam scanning technique at the synchrotron accelerator of the Heavy Ion Therapy centre in Heidelberg utilizing an array of four Compton cameras in a twofold front-to-front configuration. The results demonstrate that the hybrid PET-PGI technique can be well suited for relatively low energies (55-155 MeV) and beams of protons. On the other hand, for heavier beams of helium and carbon ions at higher energies (155-275 MeV), range monitoring becomes more challenging owing to large backgrounds from additional nuclear processes. The experimental results are well understood on the basis of realistic Monte Carlo (MC) calculations, which show a satisfactory agreement with the measured data. This work can guide further upgrades of the hybrid PET-PGI system towards a clinical implementation of this innovative technique.</description>

      <title>Imaging Transformer for MRI Denoising: a Scalable Model Architecture that enables SNR &lt;&lt; 1 Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To propose a flexible and scalable imaging transformer (IT) architecture with three attention modules for multi-dimensional imaging data and apply it to MRI denoising with very low input SNR.
  Methods: Three independent attention modules were developed: spatial local, spatial global, and frame attentions. They capture long-range signal correlation and bring back the locality of information in images. An attention-cell-block design processes 5D tensors ([B, C, F, H, W]) for 2D, 2D+T, and 3D image data. A High Resolution (HRNet) backbone was built to hold IT blocks. Training dataset consists of 206,677 cine series and test datasets had 7,267 series. Ten input SNR levels from 0.05 to 8.0 were tested. IT models were compared to seven convolutional and transformer baselines. To test scalability, four IT models 27m to 218m parameters were trained. Two senior cardiologists reviewed IT model outputs from which the EF was measured and compared against the ground-truth.
  Results: IT models significantly outperformed other models over the tested SNR levels. The performance gap was most prominent at low SNR levels. The IT-218m model had the highest SSIM and PSNR, restoring good image quality and anatomical details even at SNR 0.2. Two experts agreed at this SNR or above, the IT model output gave the same clinical interpretation as the ground-truth. The model produced images that had accurate EF measurements compared to ground-truth values.
  Conclusions: Imaging transformer model offers strong performance, scalability, and versatility for MR denoising. It recovers image quality suitable for confident clinical reading and accurate EF measurement, even at very low input SNR of 0.2.</description>

      <title>On the optimisation of the geometric pattern for structured illumination based X-ray phase contrast and dark field imaging: A simulation study and its experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-contrast and dark-field imaging are relatively new X-ray imaging modalities that provide additional information to conventional attenuation-based imaging. However, this new information comes at the price of a more complex acquisition scheme and optical components. Among the different techniques available, such as Grating Interferometry or Edge Illumination, modulation-based and more generally single-mask/grid imaging techniques simplify these new procedures to obtain phase and dark-field images by shifting the experimental complexity to the numerical post-processing side. This family of techniques involves inserting a membrane into the X-ray beam that locally modulating the intensity to create a pattern on the detector which serves as a reference.
  However, the topological nature of the mask used seems to determine the quality of the reconstructed phase and dark-field images. We present in this article an in-depth study of the impact of the membrane parameters used in a single mask imaging approach. A spiral topology seems to be an optimum both in terms of resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio compared to random and regular patterns.</description>

      <title>Intraoperative perfusion assessment by continuous, low-latency hyperspectral light-field imaging: development, methodology, and clinical application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate assessment of tissue perfusion is crucial in visceral surgery, especially during anastomosis. Currently, subjective visual judgment is commonly employed in clinical settings. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a non-invasive, quantitative alternative. However, HSI imaging lacks continuous integration into the clinical workflow. This study presents a hyperspectral light field system for intraoperative tissue oxygen saturation (SO2) analysis and visualization. We present a correlation method for determining SO2 saturation with low computational demands. We demonstrate clinical application, with our results aligning with the perfusion boundaries determined by the surgeon. We perform and compare continuous perfusion analysis using two hyperspectral cameras (Cubert S5, Cubert X20), achieving processing times of &lt; 170 ms and &lt; 400 ms, respectively. We discuss camera characteristics, system parameters, and the suitability for clinical use and real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Exploring Offline Pileup Correction to Improve the Accuracy of Microdosimetric Characterization in Clinical Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microdosimetry investigates the energy deposition of ionizing radiation at microscopic scales, beyond the assessment capabilities of macroscopic dosimetry. This contributes to an understanding of the biological response in radiobiology, radiation protection and radiotherapy. Microdosimetric pulse height spectra are usually measured using an ionization detector in a pulsed readout mode. This incorporates a charge-sensitive amplifier followed by a shaping network. At high particle rates, the pileup of multiple pulses leads to distortions in the recorded spectra. Especially for gas-based detectors, this is a significant issue, that can be reduced by using solid-state detectors with smaller cross-sectional areas and faster readout speeds. At particle rates typical for ion therapy, however, such devices will also experience pileup. Mitigation techniques often focus on avoiding pileup altogether, while post-processing approaches are rarely investigated. This work explores pileup effects in microdosimetric measurements and presents a stochastic resampling algorithm, allowing for offline simulation and correction of spectra. Initially it was developed for measuring neutron spectra with tissue equivalent proportional counters and is adapted for the use with solid-state microdosimeters in a clinical radiotherapy setting. The algorithm was tested on data acquired with solid-state microdosimeters at the MedAustron ion therapy facility. The successful simulation and reduction of pileup counts is achieved by establishing of a limited number of parameters for a given setup. The presented results illustrate the potential of offline correction methods in situations where a direct pileup-free measurement is currently not practicable.</description>
