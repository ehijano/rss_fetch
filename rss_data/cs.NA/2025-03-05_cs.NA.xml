      <title>Upper and Lower Error Bounds for a Compact Fourth-Order Finite-Difference Scheme for the Wave Equation with Nonsmooth Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compact fourth-order finite-difference scheme for solving the 1d wave equation is studied. New error bounds of the fractional order $\mathcal{O}(h^{4(\lambda-1)/5})$ are proved in the mesh energy norm in terms of data, for two initial functions from the Sobolev and Nikolskii spaces with the smoothness order $\lambda$ and $\lambda-1$ and the free term with a dominated mixed smoothness of order $\lambda-1$, for $1\leq\lambda\leq 6$. The corresponding lower error bounds are proved as well to ensure the sharpness in order of the above error bounds with respect to each of the initial functions and the free term for any $\lambda$. Moreover, they demonstrate that the upper error bounds cannot be improved if the Lebesgue summability indices in the error norm are weakened down to 1 both in $x$ and $t$ and simultaneously the summability indices in the norms of data are strengthened up to $\infty$ both in $x$ and $t$. Numerical experiments confirming the sharpness of the mentioned orders for half-integer $\lambda$ and piecewise polynomial data have already been carried out previously.</description>

      <title>Policy iteration for nonconvex viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the convergence rates of policy iteration (PI) for nonconvex viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equations using a discrete space-time scheme, where both space and time variables are discretized. We analyze the case with an uncontrolled diffusion term, which corresponds to a possibly degenerate viscous Hamilton--Jacobi equation. We first obtain an exponential convergent result of PI for the discrete space-time schemes. We then investigate the discretization error.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Reconstruction of Piecewise-Smooth Functions of Two Variables from Fourier Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of reconstructing a 2D piecewise smooth function from its bandlimited Fourier measurements. This is a well known and well studied problem with many real world implications, in particular in medical imaging. While many techniques have been proposed over the years to solve the problem, very few consider the accurate reconstruction of the discontinuities themselves.
  In this work we develop an algebraic reconstruction technique for two-dimensional functions consisting of two continuity pieces with a smooth discontinuity curve. By extending our earlier one-dimensional method, we show that both the discontinuity curve and the function itself can be reconstructed with high accuracy from a finite number of Fourier measurements. The accuracy is commensurate with the smoothness of the pieces and the discontinuity curve. We also provide a numerical implementation of the method and demonstrate its performance on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear energy-preserving model reduction with lifting transformations that quadratize the energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing model reduction techniques for high-dimensional models of conservative partial differential equations (PDEs) encounter computational bottlenecks when dealing with systems featuring non-polynomial nonlinearities. This work presents a nonlinear model reduction method that employs lifting variable transformations to derive structure-preserving quadratic reduced-order models for conservative PDEs with general nonlinearities. We present an energy-quadratization strategy that defines the auxiliary variable in terms of the nonlinear term in the energy expression to derive an equivalent quadratic lifted system with quadratic system energy. The proposed strategy combined with proper orthogonal decomposition model reduction yields quadratic reduced-order models that conserve the quadratized lifted energy exactly in high dimensions. We demonstrate the proposed model reduction approach on four nonlinear conservative PDEs: the one-dimensional wave equation with exponential nonlinearity, the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon equation with parametric dependence, and the two-dimensional Klein-Gordon-Zakharov equations. The numerical results show that the proposed lifting approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art structure-preserving hyper-reduction method in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency in the online stage while providing significant computational gains in the offline stage.</description>

      <title>Airy Phase Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of the solutions of a differential equation of the form $y''(t) + \omega^2 q(t) y(t) =0$ depends not only on that of the coefficient $q$, but also on the magnitude of the parameter $\omega$. In the most widely-studied case, when $q$ is positive, the solutions of equations of this type oscillate at a frequency that increases linearly with $\omega$ and standard ODE solvers require $\mathcal{O}\left(\omega\right)$ time to calculate them. It is well known, though, that phase function methods can be used to solve such equations numerically in time independent of $\omega$. Unfortunately, the running time of these methods increases with $\omega$ when they are applied in the commonly-occurring case in when $q$ has zeros in the solution domain (i.e., when the differential equation has turning points). Here, we introduce a generalized phase function method adapted to equations with simple turning points. More explicitly, we show the existence of slowly-varying ``Airy phase functions'' which represent the solutions of such equations at a cost which is independent of $\omega$ and describe a numerical method for calculating these Airy phase functions in time independent of $\omega$. Using our method, initial or boundary value problems for a large class of second order linear ordinary differential equations with turning points whose coefficients depend on a parameter $\omega$ can be solved in time independent of $\omega$. We also give the results of numerical experiments conducted to demonstrate the properties of our method, including one in which we used our algorithm to rapidly calculate associated Legendre functions of a wide range of orders and degrees.</description>

      <title>Positive semidefinite/positive semidefinite splitting iteration methods for solving nonsingular non-Hermitian positive semidefinite systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an iterative method for solving nonsingular non-Hermitian positive semidefinite systems of linear equations. To construct the iteration process, the coefficient matrix is split into two non-Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices along with an arbitrary Hermitian positive definite shift matrix. Several conditions are established to guarantee the convergence of method and suggestions are provided for selecting the matrices involved in the desired splitting. We explore selection process of the shift matrix and determine the optimal parameter in a specific scenario. The proposed method aims to generalize previous approaches and improve the conditions for convergence theorems. In addition, we examine two special cases of this method and compare the induced preconditioners with some state-of-art preconditioners. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate effectiveness of the presented preconditioners.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pressure-robust virtual element method for the Oseen problem. In the advection-dominated case, the method is stabilized with a three level jump of the convective term. To analyze the method, we prove specific estimates for the virtual space of potentials. Finally, e prove stability of the proposed method in the advection-dominated limit and derive h-version error estimates for the velocity and the pressure.</description>

      <title>An optimal-transport finite-particle method for driven mass diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a finite-particle method of mass transport that accounts for general mixed boundary conditions. The particle method couples a geometrically-exact treatment of advection; Wasserstein gradient-flow dynamics; and a Kullback-Leibler representation of the entropy. General boundary conditions are enforced by introducing an adsorption/depletion layer at the boundary wherein particles are added or removed as dictated by the boundary conditions. We demonstrate the range and scope of the method through a number of examples of application, including absorption of particles into a sphere and flow through pipes of square and circular cross section, with and without occlusions. In all cases, the solution is observed to converge weakly, or in the sense of local averages.</description>

      <title>Online Pseudo-average Shifting Attention(PASA) for Robust Low-precision LLM Inference: Algorithms and Numerical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention calculation is extremely time-consuming for long-sequence inference tasks, such as text or image/video generation, in large models. To accelerate this process, we developed a low-precision, mathematically-equivalent algorithm called PASA, based on Flash Attention. PASA introduces two novel techniques: online pseudo-average shifting and global recovering. These techniques enable the use of half-precision computation throughout the Flash Attention process without incurring overflow instability or unacceptable numerical accuracy loss. This algorithm enhances performance on memory-restricted AI hardware architectures, such as the Ascend Neural-network Processing Unit(NPU), by reducing data movement and increasing computational FLOPs. The algorithm is validated using both designed random benchmarks and real large models. We find that the large bias and amplitude of attention input data are critical factors contributing to numerical overflow ($&gt;65504$ for half precision) in two different categories of large models (Qwen2-7B language models and Stable-Video-Diffusion multi-modal models). Specifically, overflow arises due to the large bias in the sequence dimension and the resonance mechanism between the query and key in the head dimension of the Stable-Video-Diffusion models. The resonance mechanism is defined as phase coincidence or 180-degree phase shift between query and key matrices. It will remarkably amplify the element values of attention score matrix. This issue also applies to the Qwen models. Additionally, numerical accuracy is assessed through root mean square error (RMSE) and by comparing the final generated texts and videos to those produced using high-precision attention.</description>

      <title>Goat Optimization Algorithm: A Novel Bio-Inspired Metaheuristic for Global Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Goat Optimization Algorithm (GOA), a novel bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization technique inspired by goats' adaptive foraging, strategic movement, and parasite avoidance behaviors.GOA is designed to balance exploration and exploitation effectively by incorporating three key mechanisms, adaptive foraging for global search, movement toward the best solution for local refinement, and a jump strategy to escape local optima.A solution filtering mechanism is introduced to enhance robustness and maintain population diversity. The algorithm's performance is evaluated on standard unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions, demonstrating significant improvements over existing metaheuristics, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). Comparative analysis highlights GOA's superior convergence rate, enhanced global search capability, and higher solution accuracy.A Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirms the statistical significance of GOA's exceptional performance. Despite its efficiency, computational complexity and parameter sensitivity remain areas for further optimization. Future research will focus on adaptive parameter tuning, hybridization with other metaheuristics, and real-world applications in supply chain management, bioinformatics, and energy optimization. The findings suggest that GOA is a promising advancement in bio-inspired optimization techniques.</description>

      <title>On the choice of proper outlet boundary conditions for numerical simulation of cardiovascular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that in the computational fluid dynamics simulations related to the cardiovascular system the enforcement of outflow boundary conditions is a crucial point. In fact, they highly affect the computed flow and a wrong setup could lead to unphysical results. In this chapter we discuss the main features of two different ways for the estimation of proper outlet boundary conditions in the context of hemodynamics simulations: on one side, a lumped parameter model of the downstream circulation and, on the other one, a technique based on optimal control.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the mechanical boundary conditions for a patient-specific thoracic aorta model including the heart motion effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: we propose a procedure for calibrating 4 parameters governing the mechanical boundary conditions (BCs) of a thoracic aorta (TA) model derived from one patient with ascending aortic aneurysm. The BCs reproduce the visco-elastic structural support provided by the soft tissue and the spine and allow for the inclusion of the heart motion effect.
  Methods: we first segment the TA from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) angiography and derive the heart motion by tracking the aortic annulus from cine-MRI. A rigid-wall fluid-dynamic simulation is performed to derive the time-varying wall pressure field. We build the finite element model considering patient-specific material properties and imposing the derived pressure field and the motion at the annulus boundary. The calibration, which involves the zero-pressure state computation, is based on purely structural simulations. After obtaining the vessel boundaries from the cine-MRI sequences, an iterative procedure is performed to minimize the distance between them and the corresponding boundaries derived from the deformed structural model. A strongly-coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis is finally performed with the tuned parameters and compared to the purely structural simulation.
  Results and Conclusion: the calibration with structural simulations allows to reduce maximum and mean distances between image-derived and simulation-derived boundaries from 8.64 mm to 6.37 mm and from 2.24 mm to 1.83 mm, respectively. The maximum root mean square error between the deformed structural and FSI surface meshes is 0.19 mm. This procedure may prove crucial for increasing the model fidelity in replicating the real aortic root kinematics.</description>

      <title>Equivalence Classes Induced by Binary Tree Isomorphism -- Generating Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with generating functions, the combinatorics of a recurrence relation can be expressed in a way that allows for more efficient calculation of the quantity. This is true of the Catalan numbers for an ordered binary tree \cite{abboud2018subtree}. Binary tree isomorphism is an important problem in computer science. The enumeration of the number of non-isomorphic rooted binary trees is therefore well known. The paper reiterates the known results for ordered binary trees and presents previous results for the enumeration of non-isomorphic rooted binary trees. Then, new enumeration results are put forward for two-colour binary tree isomorphism parametrized by the number of nodes, the number of specific colours and the number of non-isomorphic sibling subtrees. Multi-variate generating function equations are presented that enumerate these tree structures. The generating functions with these parametrizations separate multiplicatively into simplified generating function equations.</description>

      <title>Implementing PID Controller on a hand follower robot using Numerical Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overall, in any system, the proportional term, integral term, and derivative term combined to produce a fast response time, less overshoot, no oscillations, increased stability, and no steady-state errors. Eliminating the steady state errors connected to typical PID systems is crucial for achieving stability. To plot the transfer function's responses with various integrator gains for auto tuning, a MATLAB M-file was developed. Auto tuning techniques were then applied to PID systems to eliminate steady state defects. this paper analyzes and tests the improvement of PID controller over the regular P-controller taking a hand follower robot as a system example using methods with simulation and numerical analysis study.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we study a Crouzeix-Raviart approximation of the obstacle problem, which imposes the obstacle constraint in the midpoints (i.e., barycenters) of the elements of a triangulation. We establish a priori error estimates imposing natural regularity assumptions, which are optimal, and the reliability and efficiency of a primal-dual type a posteriori error estimator for general obstacles and involving data oscillation terms stemming only from the right-hand side. Numerical experiments are carried out to support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Modelling pathwise uncertainty of Stochastic Differential Equations samplers via Probabilistic Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers have been introduced over the past decade as uncertainty-aware numerical integrators. They typically proceed by assuming a functional prior to the ODE solution, which is then queried on a grid to form a posterior distribution over the ODE solution. As the queries span the integration interval, the approximate posterior solution then converges to the true deterministic one. Gaussian ODE filters, in particular, have enjoyed a lot of attention due to their computational efficiency, the simplicity of their implementation, as well as their provable fast convergence rates. In this article, we extend the methodology to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and propose a probabilistic simulator for SDEs. Our approach involves transforming the SDE into a sequence of random ODEs using piecewise differentiable approximations of the Brownian motion. We then apply probabilistic ODE solvers to the individual ODEs, resulting in a pathwise probabilistic solution to the SDE\@. We establish worst-case strong $1.5$ local and $1.0$ global convergence orders for a specific instance of our method. We further show how we can marginalise the Brownian approximations, by incorporating its coefficients as part of the prior ODE model, allowing for computing exact transition densities under our model. Finally, we numerically validate the theoretical findings, showcasing reasonable weak convergence properties in the marginalised version.</description>

      <title>Symmetric, Optimization-based, Cross-element Compatible Nodal Distributions for High-order Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework to construct symmetric, well-conditioned, cross-element compatible nodal distributions that can be used for high-order and high-dimensional finite elements. Starting from the inherent symmetries of an element geometry, we construct node groups in a systematic and efficient manner utilizing the natural coordinates of each element, while ensuring nodes stay within the elements. Proper constraints on the symmetry group lead to nodal distributions that ensure cross-element compatibility (i.e., nodes of adjacent elements are co-located) on both homogeneous and mixed meshes. The final nodal distribution is defined as a minimizer of an optimization problem over symmetry group parameters with linear constraints that ensure nodes remain with an element and enforce other properties (e.g., cross-element compatibility). We demonstrate the merit of this framework by comparing the proposed optimization-based nodal distributions with other popular distributions available in the literature, and its robustness by generating optimized nodal distributions for otherwise difficult elements (such as simplex and pyramid elements). All nodal distributions are tabulated in the optnodes package [22].</description>

      <title>Data-driven micromorphic mechanics for materials with strain localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15966v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the role of generalized continuum mechanics, and the feasibility of model-free data-driven computing approaches thereof, in solids undergoing failure by strain localization. Specifically, we set forth a methodology for capturing material instabilities using data-driven mechanics without prior information regarding the failure mode. We show numerically that, in problems involving strain localization, the standard data-driven framework for Cauchy/Boltzmann continua fails to capture the length scale of the material, as expected. We address this shortcoming by formulating a generalized data-driven framework for micromorphic continua that effectively captures both stiffness and length-scale information, as encoded in the material data, in a model-free manner. These properties are exhibited systematically in a one-dimensional softening bar problem and further verified through selected plane-strain problems.</description>

      <title>Cut-edge centralities in an undirected graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A centrality measure of the cut-edges of an undirected graph, given in [Altafini et al.~SIMAX 2023] and based on Kemeny's constant, is revisited. A numerically more stable expression is given to compute this measure, and an explicit expression is provided for some classes of graphs, including one-path graphs and trees formed by three or more branches. These results theoretically confirm the good physical behaviour of this centrality measure, experimentally observed in [Altafini et al.~SIMAX 2023]. Numerical tests are reported to check the stability and to confirm the good physical behaviour.</description>

      <title>Scalable Binary CUR Low-Rank Approximation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable binary CUR low-rank approximation algorithm that leverages parallel selection of representative rows and columns within a deterministic framework. By employing a blockwise adaptive cross approximation strategy, the algorithm efficiently identifies dominant components in large-scale matrices, thereby reducing computational costs. Numerical experiments on $16,384 \times 16,384$ matrices demonstrate a good speed-up, with execution time decreasing from $12.37$ seconds using $2$ processes to $1.02$ seconds using $64$ processes. The tests on Hilbert matrices and synthetic low-rank matrices of different size across various sizes demonstrate an near-optimal reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Reduction by Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel non-linear model reduction method: Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition (PMD), which provides a powerful framework for constructing non-intrusive reduced-order models (ROMs) by embedding a high-dimensional system into a low-dimensional probabilistic manifold and predicting the dynamics. Through explicit mappings, PMD captures both linearity and non-linearity of the system. A key strength of PMD lies in its predictive capabilities, allowing it to generate stable dynamic states based on embedded representations.
  The method also offers a mathematically rigorous approach to analyze the convergence of linear feature matrices and low-dimensional probabilistic manifolds, ensuring that sample-based approximations converge to the true data distributions as sample sizes increase. These properties, combined with its computational efficiency, make PMD a versatile tool for applications requiring high accuracy and scalability, such as fluid dynamics simulations and other engineering problems. By preserving the geometric and probabilistic structures of the high-dimensional system, PMD achieves a balance between computational speed, accuracy, and predictive capabilities, positioning itself as a robust alternative to the traditional model reduction method.</description>
