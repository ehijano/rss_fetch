      <title>Generalized Sublevel Estimates for Form-Valued Functions and Related Results for Radon-like Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the testing condition for Radon-Brascamp-Lieb multilinear functionals established in arXiv:2201.12201, this paper is concerned with identifying local conditions on smooth maps $u(t)$ with values in the space of decomposable p-forms on some real vector space V which guarantee uniform integrability of $||u(t)||^{-\tau}$ over a certain natural, noncompact family of norms. One can loosely regard this problem as a higher-dimensional analogue of establishing uniform bounds for the size of a sublevel set of a function in terms of the size of its derivatives. The resulting theorem relies extensively on ideas from Geometric Invariant Theory to understand what appropriate derivative bounds look like in this context. Several examples and applications are presented, including a new local characterization of so-called "model" Radon-like transforms in terms of the semistability of a natural curvature functional (giving an equivalent but rather different criterion than the one first established in arXiv:2303.03325).</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-infinity stability and mean field limit of discrete interaction energy minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give a quantitative stability result for the discrete interaction energy on the multi-dimensional torus, for the periodic Riesz potential. It states that if the number of particles $N$ is large and the discrete interaction energy is low, then the particle distribution is necessarily close to the uniform distribution (i.e., the continuous energy minimizer) in the Wasserstein-infinity distance. As a consequence, we obtain a quantitative mean field limit of interaction energy minimizers in the Wasserstein-infinity distance. The proof is based on the application of the author's previous joint work with J. Wang on the stability of continuous energy minimizer, together with a new mollification trick for the empirical measure in the case of singular interaction potentials.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an type oscillation inequalities in $L^q$ norm on the boundary of convex polygonal domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1939 P\'al Tur\'an and J\'anos Er\H{o}d initiated the study of lower estimations of maximum norms of derivatives of polynomials, in terms of the maximum norms of the polynomials themselves, on convex domains of the complex plane. As a matter of normalization they considered the family $\mathcal{P}_n(K)$ of degree $n$ polynomials with all zeros lying in the given convex, compact subset $K\Subset {\mathbb C}$. While Tur\'an obtained the first results for the interval $I:=[-1,1]$ and the disk $D:=\{ z\in {\mathbb C}~:~ |z|\le 1\}$, Er\H{o}d extended investigations to other compact convex domains, too. The order of the optimal constant was found to be $\sqrt{n}$ for $I$ and $n$ for $D$. It took until 2006 to clarify that all compact convex \emph{domains} (with nonempty interior), follow the pattern of the disk, and admit an order $n$ inequality.
  For $L^q(\partial K)$ norms with any $1\le q &lt;\infty$ we obtained order $n$ results for various classes of domains. Further, in the generality of all convex, compact domains we could show a $c n/\log n$ lower bound together with an $O(n)$ upper bound for the optimal constant. Also, we conjectured that all compact convex domains admit an order $n$ Tur\'an type inequality. Here we prove this for all \emph{polygonal} convex domains and any $0&lt; q &lt;\infty$.</description>

      <title>Tracking controllability for finite-dimensional linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze the concept of tracking controllability, where the objective is for the state of a control system, or some projection thereof, to follow a given trajectory within a specified time horizon. By leveraging duality, we characterize tracking controllability through a non-standard observability inequality for the adjoint system. This characterization facilitates the development of a systematic approach for constructing controls with minimal norm. However, achieving such an observability property is challenging. To address this, we utilize the classical Brunovsk\'y canonical form for control systems, specifically focusing on the case of scalar controls. Our findings reveal that tracking control inherently involves a loss of regularity in the controls. This phenomenon is highly sensitive to the system's structure and the interaction between the projection to be tracked and the system.</description>

      <title>Principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for partially degenerate nonlocal dispersal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the principal spectral theory and asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems, specifically focusing on the case where partial diffusion coefficients are zero, referred to as the partially degenerate case. We propose two sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of the principal eigenvalue in these partially degenerate systems. Additionally, we study the asymptotic behavior of the spectral bound for nonlocal dispersal operators with small and large diffusion coefficients, considering both non-degenerate and partially degenerate cases. Notably, we find a threshold-type result as the diffusion coefficients tend towards infinity in the partially degenerate case. Finally, we apply these findings to discuss the asymptotic behavior of the basic reproduction ratio in a viral diffusion model.</description>

      <title>The Laplace-Beltrami Operator on the Surface of the Ellipsoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Laplace-Beltrami operator on (the surface of) a triaxial ellipsoid admits a sequence of real eigenvalues diverging to plus infinity. By introducing ellipsoidal coordinates, this eigenvalue problem for a partial differential operator is reduced to a two-parameter regular Sturm-Liouville problem involving ordinary differential operators. This two-parameter eigenvalue problem has two families of eigencurves whose intersection points determine the eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Eigenvalues are approximated numerically through eigenvalues of generalized matrix eigenvalue problems. Ellipsoids close to spheres are studied employing Lam&amp;#233; polynomials.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Fourier Decay For Patterson-Sullivan Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Fourier transform of Patterson-Sullivan measures associated to convex cocompact groups of isometries of real hyperbolic space decays polynomially quickly at infinity. The proof is based on the $L^2$-flattening theorem obtained in prior work of the author, combined with a method based on dynamical self-similarity for ruling out the sparse set of potential frequencies where the Fourier transform can be large.</description>

      <title>Spectral gaps and Fourier decay for self-conformal measures in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Phi$ be a $C^\omega (\mathbb{C})$ self-conformal IFS on the plane, satisfying some mild non-linearity and irreducibility conditions. We prove a uniform spectral gap estimate for the transfer operator corresponding to the derivative cocycle and every given self-conformal measure. Building on this result, we establish polynomial Fourier decay for any such measure. Our technique is based on a refinement of a method of Oh-Winter (2017) where we do not require separation from the IFS or the Federer property for the underlying measure.</description>
