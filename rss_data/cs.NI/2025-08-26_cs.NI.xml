      <title>QoS-based Intelligent multi-connectivity for B5G networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technologies has established cellular networks as the backbone for diverse applications, each with distinct quality of service requirements. Meeting these varying demands within a unified infrastructure presents a critical challenge that can be addressed through advanced techniques such as multi-connectivity. Multiconnectivity enables User equipments to connect to multiple BSs simultaneously, facilitating QoS differentiation and provisioning. This paper proposes a QoS-aware multi-connectivity framework leveraging machine learning to enhance network performance. The approach employs deep neural networks to estimate the achievable QoS metrics of BSs, including data rate, reliability, and latency. These predictions inform the selection of serving clusters and data rate allocation, ensuring that the User Equipment connects to the optimal BSs to meet its QoS needs. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances Quality of Service (QoS) for applications where traditional and state-of-the-art methods are inadequate. Specifically, the algorithm achieves a QoS success rate of 98%. Furthermore, it improves spectrum efficiency by 30% compared to existing multi-connectivity solutions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of FTN-NOFDM and PCS-OFDM for Long-Haul Coherent Optical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-wavelength 400G coherent optical communications have become a critical solution to meet the explosive traffic demands. However, the single-carrier modulation using low-order modulation formats requires a broader wavelength division multiplexing grid and expands the occupied optical bandwidth. In this paper, we propose the faster-than-Nyquist non-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FTN-NOFDM) to improve the spectral efficiency for long-haul coherent optical communications. The subcarrier number is set to eight to enable low-complexity FTN-NOFDM signal generation using a pruned inverse fast Fourier transform and inter-carrier interference (ICI) cancellation. To deal with the conventional timing recovery (TR) failure, a frequency tone-based TR is proposed for FTN-NOFDM. A time-domain multiple-input multiple-output equalizer is designed to update the tap coefficients based on outputs of conventional iterative detection (ID). To further mitigate ICI, a low-density parity check-assisted ID is integrated into the conventional ID module. FTN-NOFDM, probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS)-OFDM, and quadrature phase shift keying-OFDM are experimentally compared in a 400G coherent optical communication system over 11 cascaded 125-GHz wavelength-selective switches (WSSs) and 2000 km transmission. Results show that the FTN-NOFDM exhibits comparable WSS filtering tolerance to PCS-OFDM and superior nonlinearity tolerance, while PCS-OFDM achieves the best bit error ratio performance.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Anonymity and Efficiency: A Critical Review of Path Selection Strategies in Tor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Onion Router (Tor) relies on path selection algorithms to balance performance and anonymity by determining how traffic flows through its relay network. As Tor scales and usage patterns evolve, default strategies such as bandwidth-weighted random selection and persistent guard nodes face increasing performance limitations. This study presents a comparative evaluation of five path selection strategies: Random, Guard, Congestion-Aware, and two Geographic approaches (Diversity Driven and Latency-Optimized) using a high-fidelity simulation model inspired by TorPS (Tor Path Simulator). Experiments were conducted across five network scales, simulating 37,500 circuits under realistic relay conditions. Results show that Geographic (Latency-Optimized) consistently achieved the lowest latency (40.0 ms) and highest efficiency, while Congestion-Aware strategies delivered the best throughput, outperforming the baseline by up to 42%. Guard nodes maintained stable routing but exhibited latency increases under larger networks. No single method proved optimal across all scenarios, but each revealed clear strengths for specific use cases. These findings demonstrate that targeted path selection can significantly improve Tor's performance without compromising anonymity, providing guidance for optimizing circuit construction in future development and deployments.</description>

      <title>Sustainability or Survivability? Eliminating the Need to Choose in LEO Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LEO Satellite Networks (LSNs) are revolutionizing global connectivity, but their reliance on tens of thousands of satellites raises pressing concerns over sustainability and survivability. In this work, we argue that the inefficiencies in LSN designs stem from ignoring the strong spatiotemporal structure of Internet traffic demand (which impacts sustainability) and the physical realities of the near-Earth space environment (which affects survivability). We propose a novel design approach based on sun-synchronous (SS) orbits called SS-plane, which aligns satellite coverage with the Earth's diurnal cycle. We demonstrate that SS-plane constellations can reduce the number of satellites required by up to an order of magnitude and cut radiation exposure by ~23% compared to traditional Walker-delta constellations. These findings suggest a paradigm shift in LSN research from large, disposable megaconstellations to more sustainable, targeted LEO constellations.</description>

      <title>Real World Assets on-Chain Assistance Low-Altitude Computility Networks: Architecture, Methodology, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-altitude airspace is becoming a new frontier for smart city services and commerce. Networks of drones, electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) vehicles, and other aircraft, termed Low-Altitude Economic Networks (LAENets), promise to transform urban logistics, aerial sensing, and communication. A key challenge is how to efficiently share and trust the computing utility, termed computility, of these aerial devices. We propose treating the computing power on aircraft as tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) that can be traded and orchestrated via blockchain. By representing distributed edge computing resources as blockchain tokens, disparate devices can form Low-Altitude Computility Networks (LACNets), collaborative computing clusters in the sky. We first compare blockchain technologies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and RWA frameworks to clarify how physical hardware and its computational output can be tokenized as assets. Then, we present an architecture using blockchain to integrate aircraft fleets into a secure, interoperable computing network. Furthermore, a case study models an urban logistics LACNet of delivery drones and air-taxis. Simulation results indicate improvements in task latency, trust assurance, and resource efficiency when leveraging RWA-based coordination. Finally, we discuss future research directions, including AI-driven orchestration, edge AI offloading and collaborative computing, and cross-jurisdictional policy for tokenized assets.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Assisted Proactive Management in Zero Touch Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of cellular networks and rising demand for high-quality services require efficient and autonomous network management solutions. Zero Touch Network (ZTN) management has emerged as a key approach to automating network operations, minimizing manual intervention, and improving service reliability. Digital Twin (DT) creates a virtual representation of the physical network in realtime, allowing continuous monitoring, predictive analytics, and intelligent decision-making by simulating what-if scenarios. This paper integrates DT with ZTN proactive bandwidth management in end-to-end (E2E) next-generation networks. The integrated architecture applies Few-Shot Learning (FSL) to a memoryaugmented Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to predict a new network state to augment the known and trained states. Using Q-learning, it determines the optimal action (e.g. traffic shaping) under varying network conditions such that user Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are met. Three scenarios have been considered: 1) normal ZTN operation with closed-loop control, 2) a what-if scenario of DT, and 3) network state unknown to DT. The simulation results show that the network can adapt to underlying changing conditions. In addition, DT-assisted ZTN achieves better performance than the other techniques.</description>

      <title>Automating Conflict-Aware ACL Configurations with Natural Language Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ACL configuration is essential for managing network flow reachability, yet its complexity grows significantly with topologies and pre-existing rules. To carry out ACL configuration, the operator needs to (1) understand the new configuration policies or intents and translate them into concrete ACL rules, (2) check and resolve any conflicts between the new and existing rules, and (3) deploy them across the network. Existing systems rely heavily on manual efforts for these tasks, especially for the first two, which are tedious, error-prone, and impractical to scale.
  We propose Xumi to tackle this problem. Leveraging LLMs with domain knowledge of the target network, Xumi automatically and accurately translates the natural language intents into complete ACL rules to reduce operators' manual efforts. Xumi then detects all potential conflicts between new and existing rules and generates resolved intents for deployment with operators' guidance, and finally identifies the best deployment plan that minimizes the rule additions while satisfying all intents. Evaluation shows that Xumi accelerates the entire configuration pipeline by over 10x compared to current practices, addresses O(100) conflicting ACLs and reduces rule additions by ~40% in modern cloud network.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Mobile Trust Gap: A Zero Trust Framework for Consumer-Facing Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has become a widely adopted model for securing enterprise environments, promoting continuous verification and minimal trust across systems. However, its application in mobile contexts remains limited, despite mobile applications now accounting for most global digital interactions and being increasingly targeted by sophisticated threats. Existing Zero Trust frameworks developed by organisations such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) primarily focus on enterprise-managed infrastructure, assuming organisational control over devices, networks, and identities. This paper addresses a critical gap by proposing an extended Zero Trust model designed for mobile applications operating in untrusted, user-controlled environments. Using a design science methodology, the study introduced a six-pillar framework that supports runtime enforcement of trust through controls including device integrity, user identity validation, data protection, secure application programming interface (API) usage, behavioural monitoring, and live application protection. Each pillar was mapped to relevant regulatory and security standards to support compliance. A phased implementation roadmap and maturity assessment model were also developed to guide adoption across varying organisational contexts. The proposed model offers a practical and standards-aligned approach to securing mobile applications beyond pre-deployment controls, aligning real-time enforcement with Zero Trust principles. This contribution expands the operational boundaries of ZTA and provides organisations with a deployable path to reduce fraud, enhance compliance, and address emerging mobile security challenges. Future research may include empirical validation of the framework and cross-sector application testing.</description>

      <title>Cyber Orbits of Large Scale Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-performance graph libraries, such as the GraphBLAS, has enabled the analysis of massive network data sets and revealed new models for their behavior. Physical analogies for complicated network behavior can be a useful aid to understanding these newly discovered network phenomena. Prior work leveraged the canonical Gull's Lighthouse problem and developed a computational heuristic for modeling large scale network traffic using this model. A general solution using this approach requires overcoming the essential mathematical singularities in the resulting differential equations. Further investigation reveals a simpler physical interpretation that alleviates the need for solving challenging differential equations. Specifically, that the probability of observing a source at a temporal ``distance'' $r(t)$ at time $t$ is $p(t) \propto 1/r(t)^2$. This analogy aligns with many physical phenomena and can be a rich source of intuition. Applying this physical analogy to the observed source correlations in the Anonymized Network Sensing Graph Challenge data leads to an elegant cyber orbit analogy that may assist with the understanding network behavior.</description>

      <title>RF-PGS: Fully-structured Spatial Wireless Channel Representation with Planar Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability. Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss, accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels, offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.</description>

      <title>Localization using Angle-of-Arrival Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor localization is a long-standing challenge in mobile computing, with significant implications for enabling location-aware and intelligent applications within smart environments such as homes, offices, and retail spaces. As AI assistants such as Amazon Alexa and Google Nest become increasingly pervasive, microphone-equipped devices are emerging as key components of everyday life and home automation. This paper introduces a passive, infrastructure-light system for localizing human speakers using speech signals captured by two or more spatially distributed smart devices. The proposed approach, GCC+, extends the Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method to estimate the Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of audio signals at each device and applies robust triangulation techniques to infer the speaker's two-dimensional position. To further improve temporal resolution and localization accuracy, feature-space expansion and subsample interpolation techniques are employed for precise Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) estimation. The system operates without requiring hardware modifications, prior calibration, explicit user cooperation, or knowledge of the speaker's signal content, thereby offering a highly practical solution for real-world deployment. Experimental evaluation in a real-world home environment yields a median AoA estimation error of 2.2 degrees and a median localization error of 1.25 m, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of audio-based localization for enabling context-aware, privacy-preserving ambient intelligence.</description>

      <title>AgentRAN: An Agentic AI Architecture for Autonomous Control of Open 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open RAN movement has catalyzed a transformation toward programmable, interoperable cellular infrastructures. Yet, today's deployments still rely heavily on static control and manual operations. To move beyond this limitation, we introduce AgenRAN, an AI-native, Open RAN-aligned agentic framework that generates and orchestrates a fabric of distributed AI agents based on Natural Language (NL) intents. Unlike traditional approaches that require explicit programming, AgentRAN's LLM-powered agents interpret natural language intents, negotiate strategies through structured conversations, and orchestrate control loops across the network. AgentRAN instantiates a self-organizing hierarchy of agents that decompose complex intents across time scales (from sub-millisecond to minutes), spatial domains (cell to network-wide), and protocol layers (PHY/MAC to RRC). A central innovation is the AI-RAN Factory, an automated synthesis pipeline that observes agent interactions and continuously generates new agents embedding improved control algorithms, effectively transforming the network from a static collection of functions into an adaptive system capable of evolving its own intelligence. We demonstrate AgentRAN through live experiments on 5G testbeds where competing user demands are dynamically balanced through cascading intents. By replacing rigid APIs with NL coordination, AgentRAN fundamentally redefines how future 6G networks autonomously interpret, adapt, and optimize their behavior to meet operator goals.</description>

      <title>PRZK-Bind: A Physically Rooted Zero-Knowledge Authentication Protocol for Secure Digital Twin Binding in Smart Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology is rapidly becoming essential for smart city ecosystems, enabling real-time synchronisation and autonomous decision-making across physical and digital domains. However, as DTs take active roles in control loops, securely binding them to their physical counterparts in dynamic and adversarial environments remains a significant challenge. Existing authentication solutions either rely on static trust models, require centralised authorities, or fail to provide live and verifiable physical-digital binding, making them unsuitable for latency-sensitive and distributed deployments. To address this gap, we introduce PRZK-Bind, a lightweight and decentralised authentication protocol that combines Schnorr-based zero-knowledge proofs with elliptic curve cryptography to establish secure, real-time correspondence between physical entities and DTs without relying on pre-shared secrets. Simulation results show that PRZK-Bind significantly improves performance, offering up to 4.5 times lower latency and 4 times reduced energy consumption compared to cryptography-heavy baselines, while maintaining false acceptance rates more than 10 times lower. These findings highlight its suitability for future smart city deployments requiring efficient, resilient, and trustworthy DT authentication.</description>

      <title>Quantum Paths: a Quantum Walk approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum switch, a process enabling a coherent superposition of different orders of quantum channels, has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable noiseless communications through noisy channels, such as entanglement-breaking channels. However, its practical implementation and scalability remain challenging. In contrast, the spatial superposition of quantum channels is more accessible experimentally and has been shown to enhance channel capacity, although it does not match the performance of the quantum switch. In this work, we present preliminary theoretical results demonstrating that, by applying tools of the quantum random walk framework to the spatial superposition of channels, it is possible to replicate the output of a quantum switch. These findings suggest a promising and more feasible route to emulate the quantum switch, offering both practical advantages and interpretative clarity.</description>
