      <title>Exact Bayesian inference for Markov switching diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first exact Bayesian methodology for the problem of inference in discretely observed regime switching diffusions. We design an MCMC and an MCEM algorithm that target the exact posterior of diffusion parameters and the latent regime process. The algorithms are exact in the sense that they target the correct posterior distribution of the continuous model, so that the errors are due to Monte Carlo only. Switching diffusion models extend ordinary diffusions by allowing for jumps in instantaneous drift and volatility. The jumps are driven by a latent, continuous time Markov switching process. We illustrate the method on numerical examples, including an empirical analysis of the method's scalability in the length of the time series, and find that it is comparable in computational cost with discrete approximations while avoiding their shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Design Principles for Architectures of Technical Smart Service Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Successful smart services require seamless integration into existing corporate systems and an interdisciplinary approach that aligns the development of both business models and technical architectures. Multi-disciplinarity and cocreating with customers add a layer of complexity but are essential collaboration schemes for validating the value proposition of smart services and building longterm customer loyalty. This paper explores these challenges and distills the design principles for the architectures of technical smart service systems, based on empirical data from architecture projects in two manufacturing companies. These principles contribute to the sparse academic literature on this topic and help practitioners navigate several design trade-offs commonly arising in smart service projects.</description>

      <title>Non-asymptotic Analysis of Diffusion Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Generative Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the theoretical properties of general diffusion (interpolation) paths and their Langevin Monte Carlo implementation, referred to as diffusion annealed Langevin Monte Carlo (DALMC), under weak conditions on the data distribution. Specifically, we analyse and provide non-asymptotic error bounds for the annealed Langevin dynamics where the path of distributions is defined as Gaussian convolutions of the data distribution as in diffusion models. We then extend our results to recently proposed heavy-tailed (Student's t) diffusion paths, demonstrating their theoretical properties for heavy-tailed data distributions for the first time. Our analysis provides theoretical guarantees for a class of score-based generative models that interpolate between a simple distribution (Gaussian or Student's t) and the data distribution in finite time. This approach offers a broader perspective compared to standard score-based diffusion approaches, which are typically based on a forward Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noising process.</description>
