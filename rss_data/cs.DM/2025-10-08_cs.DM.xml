      <title>A Computer-Assisted Proof of the Optimal Density Bound for Pinwheel Covering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the covering version of the pinwheel scheduling problem, a daily task must be assigned to agents under the constraint that agent $i$ can perform the task at most once in any $a_i$-day interval. In this paper, we determine the optimal constant $\alpha^* = 1.264\ldots {}$ such that every instance with $\sum_{i} \frac{1}{a_i} \ge \alpha^*$ is schedulable. This resolves an open problem posed by Soejima and Kawamura (2020). Our proof combines Kawamura's (2024) techniques for the packing version with new mathematical insights, along with an exhaustive computer-aided search that draws on some ideas from G\k{a}sieniec, Smith, and Wild (2022).</description>

      <title>On the distribution of $A_\alpha$-eigenvalues in terms of graph invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$, and $A(G)$ and $D(G)$ its adjacency and degree diagonal matrices, respectively. For a parameter $\alpha \in [0,1]$, Nikiforov~(2017) introduced the convex combination $A_{\alpha}(G) = \alpha D(G) + (1 - \alpha)A(G)$. In this paper, we investigate the spectral distribution of $A_\alpha(G)$-eigenvalues, over subintervals of the real line. We establish lower and upper bounds on the number of such eigenvalues in terms of structural parameters of $G$, including the number of pendant and quasi-pendant vertices, the domination number, the matching number, and the edge covering number. Additionally, we exhibit families of graphs for which these bounds are attained. Several of our results extend known spectral bounds on the eigenvalue distributions of both the adjacency and the signless Laplacian matrices.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the parameterized and classical complexity of the s-Club Cluster Edge Deletion problem: given a graph G = (V, E) and integers k and s, determine whether it is possible to delete at most k edges so that every connected component of the resulting graph has diameter at most s. This problem generalizes Cluster Edge Deletion (the case s = 1) and captures a variety of distance-bounded graph modification tasks.
  Montecchiani, Ortali, Piselli, and Tappini (Information and Computation, 2023) showed that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by s plus the treewidth of G, and asked whether the dependence on s is necessary; that is, whether the problem is FPT when parameterized by treewidth alone. We resolve this by proving that the problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by pathwidth, and hence by treewidth.
  On the algorithmic side, we show that the problem is FPT when parameterized by neighborhood diversity, twin cover, or cluster vertex deletion number, thereby extending to all s &gt;= 1 the results of Italiano, Konstantinidis, and Papadopoulos (Algorithmica, 2023), who established FPT algorithms for the case s = 1 under the neighborhood diversity and twin cover parameters.
  From a classical perspective, we prove that the problem is NP-hard on split graphs already for s = 2, complementing the polynomial-time solvability for s = 1 due to Bonomo, Duran, and Valencia-Pabon (Theoretical Computer Science, 2015) and the trivial case s = 3.
  Finally, while the problem is FPT when parameterized by s + k, its complexity for the solution size k alone remains open. We make progress on this front by designing an FPT bicriteria approximation algorithm, which runs in time f(k, 1/epsilon) * n^{O(1)} and, for graphs excluding long induced cycles, outputs a solution of size at most k whose connected components have diameter at most (1 + epsilon) * s.</description>

      <title>On some 2-binomial coefficients of binary words: geometrical interpretation, partitions of integers, and fair words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The binomial notation (w u) represents the number of occurrences of the word u as a (scattered) subword in w. We first introduce and study possible uses of a geometrical interpretation of (w ab) and (w ba) when a and b are distinct letters. We then study the structure of the 2-binomial equivalence class of a binary word w (two words are 2-binomially equivalent if they have the same binomial coefficients, that is, the same numbers of occurrences, for each word of length at most 2). Especially we prove the existence of an isomorphism between the graph of the 2-binomial equivalence class of w with respect to a particular rewriting rule and the lattice of partitions of the integer (w ab) with (w a) parts and greatest part bounded by (w b). Finally we study binary fair words, the words over {a, b} having the same numbers of occurrences of ab and ba as subwords ((w ab) = (w ba)). In particular, we prove a recent conjecture related to a special case of the least square approximation.</description>

      <title>Extending Ghouila-Houri's Characterization of Comparability Graphs to Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An orientation of a given static graph is called transitive if for any three vertices $a,b,c$, the presence of arcs $(a,b)$ and $(b,c)$ forces the presence of the arc $(a,c)$. If only the presence of an arc between $a$ and $c$ is required, but its orientation is unconstrained, the orientation is called quasi-transitive. A fundamental result presented by Ghouila-Houri guarantees that any static graph admitting a quasi-transitive orientation also admits a transitive orientation. In a seminal work, Mertzios et al. introduced the notion of temporal transitivity in order to model information flows in simple temporal networks. We revisit the model introduced by Mertzios et al. and propose an analogous to Ghouila-Houri's characterization for the temporal scenario. We present a structure theorem that will allow us to express by a 2-SAT formula all the constraints imposed by temporal transitive orientations. The latter produces an efficient recognition algorithm for graphs admitting such orientations. Additionally, we extend the temporal transitivity model to temporal graphs having multiple time-labels associated to their edges and claim that the previous results hold in the multilabel setting. Finally, we propose a characterization of temporal comparability graphs via forbidden temporal ordered patterns.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Covering Two-vertex Multigraphs with Semi-edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of computational complexity of graph coverings, aka locally bijective graph homomorphisms, for {\em graphs with semi-edges}. The notion of graph covering is a discretization of coverings between surfaces or topological spaces, a notion well known and deeply studied in classical topology. Graph covers have found applications in discrete mathematics for constructing highly symmetric graphs, and in computer science in the theory of local computations. In 1991, Abello, Fellows, and Stillwell asked for a classification of the computational complexity of deciding if an input graph covers a fixed target graph, in the ordinary setting (of graphs with only edges). Although many general results are known, the full classification is still open. In spite of that, we propose to study the more general case of covering graphs composed of normal edges (including multiedges and loops) and so-called semi-edges. Semi-edges are becoming increasingly popular in modern topological graph theory, as well as in mathematical physics. They also naturally occur in the local computation setting, since they are lifted to matchings in the covering graph. We show some solvable cases and, in particular, completely characterize the complexity of the already very nontrivial problem of covering one- and two-vertex (multi)graphs with semi-edges. Our NP-hardness results are proven for simple input graphs, and in the case of regular two-vertex target graphs, even for bipartite ones. We remark that our new characterization results also strengthen previously known results for covering graphs without semi-edges, and they in turn apply to an infinite class of simple target graphs with at most two vertices of degree more than two. Some of the results are moreover proven in a more general setting (e.g., finding $k$-tuples of pairwise disjoint perfect matchings in regular graphs).</description>

      <title>Approximately Envy-free and Equitable Allocations of Indivisible Items for Non-monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the setting of fair allocation of indivisible items among agents with heterogeneous, non-monotone valuations. We explore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that approximately satisfy either envy-freeness or equity constraints. Approximate envy-freeness ensures that each agent values her bundle at least as much as those given to the others, after some (or any) item removal, while approximate equity guarantees roughly equal valuations among agents, under similar adjustments. As a key technical contribution of this work, by leveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we establish the existence of {\em envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore} ($\text{EF1}^c_g$) and {\em equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore} ($\text{EQ1}^c_g$) allocations, for non-monotone valuations that are always either non-negative or non-positive. These notions represent slight relaxations of the well-studied {\em envy-free-up-to-one-item} (EF1) and {\em equitable-up-to-one-item} (EQ1) guarantees, respectively. Our existential results hold even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected sub-paths. The case of non-positive valuations, in particular, has been solved by proving a novel multi-coloring variant of Sperner's Lemma that constitutes a combinatorial result of independent interest. In addition, we also design a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm that computes an $\text{EQ1}^c_g$ allocation. For monotone non-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, all the above results can be extended to EF1 and EQ1 guarantees as well. Finally, we provide existential and computational results for certain stronger {\em up-to-any-item} equity notions under objective valuations, where items are partitioned into goods and chores.</description>

      <title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</description>
