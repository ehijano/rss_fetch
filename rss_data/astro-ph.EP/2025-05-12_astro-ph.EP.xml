      <title>The survivorship bias of protoplanetary disc populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary discs has a substantial impact on theories of planet formation.
  To date, neither of the two main competing evolutionary models, namely the viscous-photoevaporative paradigm and the MHD winds model, has been ruled out by observations.
  Due to the high number of sources observed by large surveys, population synthesis is a powerful tool to distinguish the evolution mechanism in observations.
  We explore the evolution of the mass distribution of synthetic populations under the assumptions of turbulence-driven accretion and dispersal caused by internal photoevaporation.
  We find that the rapid removal of light discs often results in an apparent increase of the median mass of the survived disc population.
  This occurs both when the disc properties are independent of each other, and when typical correlations between these quantities and the stellar mass are assumed.
  Furthermore, as MHD wind-driven accretion rarely manifests the same feature, this serves as a signature of the viscous-photoevaporative evolution when dispersal proceeds from inside-out.
  Therefore, we propose the evolution of the median mass as a new method to distinguish this model in observed populations.
  This survivorship bias is not shown by the median accretion rate, which, instead, decreases with time.
  Moreover, we introduce a new criterion that estimates the disc lifetime as a function of initial conditions and an analytical relation to predict whether internal photoevaporation triggers an inside-out or an outside-in dispersal.
  We verify both analytical relations with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Noble Gas Fractionation Predictions for High Speed Sampling in the Upper Atmosphere of Venus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus, our neighboring planet, is an open-air laboratory that can be used to study why Earth and Venus evolved in such different ways. Noble gases in planetary atmospheres are tracers of their geophysical evolution, and measuring the elemental and isotopic composition of noble gases in the Venus atmosphere informs us about the origin and evolution of the entire planet. In this work we describe a new SmallSat mission concept, Venus ATMOSpheric - Sample Return (VATMOS-SR), that would return gas samples from the upper atmosphere of Venus to Earth for scientific analysis. To ensure it is possible to relate the composition of the sampled gases (acquired when the spacecraft is traveling &gt;10 km/s) to the free stream atmospheric composition, large-scale numerical simulations are employed to model the flow into and through the sampling system. An emphasis is placed on quantifying noble gas elemental and isotopic fractionation that occurs during the sample acquisition and transfer process, to determine how measured isotopic ratios of noble gases in the sample would compare to the actual isotopic ratios in the Venusian atmosphere. We find that lighter noble gases are depleted after they are sampled compared to the freestream conditions, and heavier ones are enriched, due to the high pressure gradients present in the flowfield. Finally, we observe that, in general, the numerical parameters do not have a major impact on the observed fractionation. However, the freestream velocity and density have a major impact on fractionation and need to be precisely known to properly reconstruct the fractionation in the sampling system. We demonstrate that the sample fractionation can be predicted with numerical simulations, and believe that VATMOS-SR, which could be the first mission to bring back samples from another planet, could answer key scientific questions related to understanding the evolution of Venus.</description>

      <title>Peekaboo: Secular Resonances from Evolving Stellar Oblateness Impede Transit Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secular resonances in exoplanet systems occur when two or more planets have commensurabilities in the precession rates of their orbital elements, causing an exchange of angular momentum between them. The stellar gravitational quadrupole moment, which evolves over time due to stellar spin-down over the first $\sim 100\,$Myr, causes these resonances to sweep through the parameter space (of masses and semimajor-axis ratios), affecting a wider variety of systems than when spin-down is neglected. The angular momentum exchange in these resonances typically aligns the outer planets' orbits together while misaligning the innermost planet from its companions. Here, we explore how resonance-induced (mis-)alignments between planets affect the transit outcome. We use the three-planet Kepler-619 system as a concrete case study that is relatively likely (approximately $1$:$1$ odds) to have undergone a sweeping resonance. Consequently, if the outer planets are initially misaligned, a sweeping-resonance-induced push toward alignment in the outer planets' orbits substantially increases the probability that they are observed transiting together. However, the resulting misalignment of the innermost planet from its outer companions, reduces the overall probability that Kepler-619 is observed as a multi-planet transiting system when considering any pair of planets or all three together. This implies that sweeping resonances (which may occur in $20\%$ of systems) have a deleterious effect on the transiting exoplanet sample, suppressing the detection of multi-planet transiting systems in favor of apparent single-planet systems.</description>

      <title>Search for Exoplanetary Ring Systems with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric surveys for exoplanetary ring systems have not confirmed any object with Saturn-sized ring. We systematically analyse 308 TESS planet candidates, mainly comprised of giant short-period planets orbiting nearby bright stars. These targets are selected based on the optimistic detectability of rings, assuming a favourable ring orientation. We develop a pipeline with a two-step noise reduction and compare the fitting results of both ringless and ringed transit models to the resulting phase-folded light curves. Although we identify six systems where ringed models are statistically favoured, visual inspection of the signals suggests that none of them is conclusively attributed to the presence of rings. Assuming the ring orientation favourable for detection, we determine the 3$\sigma$ upper limits on ring sizes for 125 objects. Using these ring size limits, we derive upper limits on the ring occurrence rate, such as rings with an outer radius larger than 1.8 times the planetary radii occurring at rates lower than 2%. However, these limits can be relaxed if tidal alignment between the spin and orbital axes holds. We explore an alternative detection method using transit depth variations by ring precession and estimate that 10 and 13 systems are likely detectable in TESS and Kepler data, respectively.</description>

      <title>Metal-Enriched Atmospheres in Warm (Super- and Sub-)Neptunes Induced by Extreme Atmospheric Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation impacts exoplanet atmospheres by accreting metals in solid form, leading to atmospheric C/O and S/N ratios that deviate from their host stars. Recent observations indicate differing metal abundances in planetary atmospheres compared to their stellar companions (e.g., Alderson et al. 2022; Bean et al. 2023). However, these observations are biased toward mature planets, raising questions about whether these abundances result from formation or evolved over time. Another way to alter an atmosphere is through the qescape of particles due to thermal heating. This study examines how billions of years of particle escape affect metal abundances. Using an adjusted stellar evolution code incorporating hydrodynamic escape, we model a warm ($T_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 1000$ K) super-Neptune-type planet ($M_{\mathrm{ini}} = 26$ $M_{\oplus}$) orbiting a solar-type star. Our results show increased metal-to-hydrogen abundances of $\sim$50-70x initial enrichment after 10 Gyr. We also see a 0.88x decrease in C/O abundance and a 1.27x increase in S/N abundance, which can affect the interpretation of planet formation parameters. We also simulate the evolving atmosphere using chemical kinetics and radiative transfer codes, finding substantial increases in SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O abundances and a decrease in CH$_4$ abundance. These changes are easily observable in the IR waveband transmission spectrum. Our findings demonstrate that extreme escape of lighter particles significantly influences the evolution of warm Neptunes and complicates the interpretation of their observational data. This highlights the need to consider long-term atmospheric evolution in understanding exoplanet compositions.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Based Framework for Estimating Transition Disk Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06044v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some transition disks host misaligned inner disks with radii of several au. Understanding the geometric and physical properties of these misaligned disks is essential for advancing terrestrial planet formation models. This study introduces a novel method to infer the three-dimensional structures of both inner and outer disks by analyzing non-axisymmetric shadows and the horizon in optical and infrared scattered light images of the outer disk. This method was applied to the HD 100453 system, in which infrared scattered light images from the Very Large Telescope revealed disk shadows. These results indicate that the inner disk is misaligned by $\sim$70$^{\circ}$ relative to the outer disk, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The aspect ratio of the inner disk surface was estimated to be 0.17, which may reflect the surface height of the optically thick dusty component due to vertical lofting by MHD winds or turbulence. In addition, the surface height distribution of the outer disk was characterized, providing novel insights into its vertical structure.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learning Compositional Study of Exoplanetary Material Accreted Onto Five Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs with $\texttt{cecilia}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline $\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques ($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also find evidence of statistically significant ($&gt;2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community, $\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs, therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar compositions.</description>

      <title>Uranus Flagship Science-Driven Tour Design: Community Input Poll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The highest priority Planetary Flagship from the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey is the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. This mission enables broad, cross-disciplinary science of an ice giant system, including the planet, moons, rings, and magnetosphere. The ice giants represent a size class of planet that is largely unexplored but that is common among extrasolar planet systems. At the same time, Uranus is unique, possessing a regular satellite system, rings, and a complex magnetosphere surrounding a planet tilted over for extreme seasonal variation. Exploration of the Uranian system is guided by a broad suite of science Objectives and through remote sensing, in situ probe, and fields and particles experiments. Due to the rapid nature of the Decadal concept study, the orbital tour could not be perfectly optimized, but a best effort was made to include orbit insertion, probe release and relay, and multiple satellite flybys; some Objectives were necessarily better met than others by this tour. The mission's tour trajectory can be optimized to meet any of the Decadal Science Objectives, by focusing on a particular system target, for example magnetosphere, satellites, or planet interior, but the best tour will simultaneously meet the highest priority measurements for every Objective. The community-led (with no institutional or NASA sponsorship) poll described here was designed to collect broad science inputs on the tour parameters required for each Decadal Science Objective. Here we present results aggregated by Objective, as well as compared longitudinally, of the highest priority tour needs identified across all Objectives. Both the raw and aggregated data are made publicly available for future white papers, tour and trajectory work, as well as mission and instrument design teams, but the results are not binding nor decisional in any way.</description>

      <title>Effects of Jump Detection and Ramp Fitting Algorithms on NIRISS/SOSS Exoplanet Time-Series Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jump detection and ramp fitting are fundamental steps when elevating JWST data products from up-the-ramp measurements to integration level count rate images. Occurring at an early stage of the overall data reduction and calibration framework, these steps, and any biases introduced by them, have the potential to significantly impact end-stage scientific measurements. Here we explore the differential impacts of jump detection and ramp fitting for the current default JWST pipeline implementation versus a newly developed, likelihood-based method, in the context of NIRISS/SOSS exoplanet time-series observations. Across both on-sky data and a suite of simulated data, we find that the two methods show differences in end product transmission spectra of order 10's to 100's parts-per-million. For the simulated data in particular, we show that the likelihood method offers a 12-18% improvement in the residual scatter and maximum deviations from the simulated ground truth. Finally, by repeating our simulations across various noise prescriptions, we corroborate the need for group-level 1/f noise corrections and re-emphasize the default implementation of such procedures as a key priority for the JWST pipeline with respect to near-infrared time-series observing modes.</description>

      <title>XUE. JWST spectroscopy of externally irradiated disks around young intermediate-mass stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.</description>

      <title>GECAM Discovery of Peculiar Oscillating Particle Precipitation Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and decrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation are very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating particle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion of electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation limitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations originate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we report three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM during a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant periodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three consecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we revealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of mini-pulses, shifting from "softer-earlier" to "softer-later" while showing no significant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is no association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity. Several possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles with a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events remains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may represent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).</description>
