      <title>Ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies for thermoelectric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of simple, scalable, and cost-effective methods to prepare Van der Waals materials for thermoelectric applications is a timely research field, whose potential and possibilities are still largely unexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ink-jet printing and drop-casting deposition of 2H-phase SnSe2 and WSe2 nanoflake assemblies, obtained by liquid phase exfoliation, and their characterization in terms of electronic and thermoelectric properties. The choice of optimal annealing temperature and time is crucial for preserving phase purity and stoichiometry and for removing dry residues of ink solvents at inter-flake boundaries, while maximizing the sintering of nanoflakes. An additional pressing is beneficial to improve nanoflake orientation and packing, thus enhancing electric conductivity. In nanoflake assemblies deposited by drop casting and pressed at 1 GPa, we obtained thermoelectric power factors at room temperature up to 2.2x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for SnSe2 and up to 3.0x10^-4 mW m^-1 K^-2 for WSe2.</description>

      <title>Finite-bias Coulomb blockade thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coulomb blockade thermometers (CBTs) are versatile and, in principle, primary thermometers operating down to the micro-Kelvin range but bias heating spoils the thermometry and the primary mode. Here, we introduce a method to extract the CBT electron temperature in the presence of heat created by an arbitrary bias voltage, and without assumptions on the heat flow mechanisms. The charging energy is extracted with high precision and without any other knowledge, thus making true primary thermometry possible. The experiment also reveals a subtle dependence of the charging energy on phonon temperature below 100 mK likely due to the amorphous AlO$_x$ tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Sound insulation performance of multi-layer membrane-type acoustic metamaterials based on orthogonal experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of achieving effective sound insulation using metamaterials persists in the field. In this research endeavor, a novel three-layer membrane-type acoustic metamaterial is introduced as a potential solution. Through the application of orthogonal experiments, remarkable sound insulation capabilities are demonstrated within the frequency spectrum of 100-1200 Hz. The sound insulation principle of membrane-type acoustic metamaterial is obtained through the analysis of eigenmodes at the peak and trough points, combined with sound transmission loss. In addition, an orthogonal experiment is utilized to pinpoint the critical factors that impact sound insulation performance. By using relative bandwidth as the classification criterion, the optimal combination of influencing factors is determined, thereby improving the sound transmission loss of the multi-layer membrane-type acoustic metamaterial structure and broadening the sound insulation bandwidth. This study not only contributes a fresh and practical approach to insulation material design but also offers valuable insights into advancing sound insulation technology.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network for High-Throughput Attosecond Resolution Single-shot X-ray Pulse Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As scientific facilities transition toward high-throughput, data-intensive experiments, there is a growing need for real-time computing at the edge to support autonomous decision-making and minimize data transmission bottlenecks. Department of Energy (DOE) initiatives emphasize the development of heterogeneous computing architectures that integrate machine learning (ML) models with specialized hardware such as FPGAs, GPUs, and embedded systems to meet the demands of next-generation experiments. These advances are critical for facilities such as X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs), where high-repetition-rate experiments produce terabyte-scale datasets, requiring real-time analysis and control.
  To address this challenge, we introduce DCIFR, a deep learning framework optimized for edge processing and high-speed X-ray diagnostics at SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). DCIFR leverages a hybrid neural architecture, combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and residual neural networks (ResNets) to denoise sinograms, classify X-ray sub-spikes, and extract phase separation with attosecond precision. The model achieves a phase extraction accuracy of 0.04652 radians (29.6 attoseconds at 1.2 um streaking wavelength) with inference latencies of 168.3 us and throughput exceeding 10kHz. Designed for deployment on heterogeneous architectures, DCIFR reduces computational overhead and supports future AI-driven feedback loops for ultrafast experiments. This work demonstrates the potential of edge AI and hardware acceleration to drive scalable, autonomous data analysis in next-generation DOE scientific facilities.</description>

      <title>Propagation Performance of Terahertz Channels in Lunar Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing momentum in lunar exploration programs and urgent need for robust communication systems capable of operating in dust-laden lunar environments necessitate comprehensive understanding of channel propagation characteristics in lunar conditions. In this article, we present a comprehensive analysis of terahertz (THz) channel propagation characteristics through lunar dust environments, critical for establishing reliable communication and sensing infrastructure on the Moon. We develop an extended Mie scattering model incorporating the unique properties of lunar dust particles (Apollo 11 sample 10084, Apollo 14 sample 14003, and Apollo 17 sample 70051), including their irregular morphology, dielectric characteristics, and charge-dependent behavior. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, we examine both power and bit error rate (BER) performance across varying dust conditions. Our results reveal distinct relationships between particle charge levels, morphological characteristics, and channel performance with power loss patterns and BER evolution. Our findings provide essential guidelines for developing robust lunar communication systems that integrate sensing capabilities, contributing to the establishment of sustainable lunar infrastructure.</description>

      <title>ZnO@C/PVDF Electrospun Membrane as Piezoelectric Nanogenerator for Wearable Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of wearable technology demands sustainable, flexible, and lightweight energy sources for various applications ranging from health monitoring to electronic textiles. Although wearable devices based on the piezoelectric effect are widespread, achieving simultaneous breathability, waterproof, and enhanced piezoelectric performance remains challenging. Herein, this study aims to develop a piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) using ZnO nanofillers in two morphologies (nanoparticles and nanorods), with a carbon coating (ZnO@C) core-cell structure to enhance piezoelectric performance. Electrospinning technique was employed to fabricate a lightweight, breathable, and water-resistant ZnO@C/PVDF membrane, enabling in situ electrical poling and mechanical stretching to enhance electroactive \b{eta}-phase formation and thus improve piezoelectric performance. A maximum power density of 384.83 {\mu}W/cm3 was obtained at RL = 104 k{\Omega}, with a maximum Vout = 19.9 V for ZnO@C nanorod-incorporated PVDF samples. The results demonstrate that ZnO@C nanorods exhibit superior voltage output due to their larger surface-to-volume ratio, leading to enhanced interaction with PVDF chains compared to nanoparticles. The fabricated membrane showed promising results with a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of ~0.5 kg/m2/day, indicating excellent breathability, and a water contact angle of ~116{\deg}, demonstrating significant waterproofness. These findings highlight the potential of the ZnO@C/PVDF electrospun membrane as an effective piezoelectric nanogenerator and energy harvester for wearable applications.</description>

      <title>Voltage Noise Thermometry in Integrated Circuits at Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the use of voltage noise thermometry, with a cross-correlation technique, as a dissipation-free method of thermometry inside a CMOS integrated circuit (IC). We show that this technique exhibits broad agreement with the refrigerator temperature range from 300 mK to 8 K. Furthermore, it shows substantial agreement with both an independent in-IC thermometry technique and a simple thermal model as a function of power dissipation inside the IC. As the device under test (DUT) is a resistor, it is feasible to extend this technique by placing many resistors in an IC to monitor the local temperatures, without increasing IC design complexity. This could lead to better understanding of the thermal profile of ICs at cryogenic temperatures. This has its greatest potential application in quantum computing, where the temperature at the cold classical-quantum boundary must be carefully controlled to maintain qubit performance.</description>

      <title>A highly sensitive, self-adhesive, biocompatible DLP 3D printed organohydrogel for flexible sensors and wearable devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for personalized health monitoring, wearable sensors have gained attention in medical diagnostics and physiological tracking. Hydrogels, known for their mechanical properties and similarity to biological tissues, are ideal for flexible sensing. However, conventional hydrogels face challenges in stability, biocompatibility, adhesion, and long-term comfort, especially in dynamic conditions.This study presents a highly sensitive, self-adhesive, and biocompatible organohydrogel fabricated via DLP 3D printing. By integrating an entanglement-dominated crosslinking mechanism with chemical and physical crosslinking, the hydrogel achieves high elasticity, mechanical strength, and durability. Methacrylic anhydride-grafted \k{appa}-carrageenan serves as the primary network, with optimized grafting rates enhancing tensile properties and strain modulation. The copolymer network of MA-kappa-CA and ACMO benefits from steric hindrance effects, improving swelling integrity and long-term stability.Experimental results confirm sustained adhesion and structural integrity under prolonged skin exposure, making it suitable for extended wear. The hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile resilience, flexibility, and strain-sensing capabilities. In vitro studies validate its biocompatibility, supporting its biomedical potential. Furthermore, its integration into wearable smart devices demonstrates promise for cervical spine monitoring and sports rehabilitation. A CNN-based system enables real-time, multi-channel analysis of cervical motion, proving its viability as a high-sensitivity flexible sensor for health monitoring and injury prevention.The proposed DLP 3D-printed hydrogel offers significant applications in flexible electronics, wearable sensors, and biomedical technologies, paving the way for next-generation health-monitoring systems.</description>

      <title>Diameter dependence of light absorption in GaAs nanowires evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires are attractive for photovoltaic applications because light absorption can be enhanced compared to planar layers due to the more complex coupling of light with wavelength-scale matter. However, experimentally it is very challenging to investigate light absorption in single nanowires. Here, we employ photoluminescence spectroscopy as a new method to investigate how the diameter of highly phase-pure GaAs nanowires affects light absorption. The underlying concept is that the absorption of the exciting laser light influences the photogenerated carrier density and in turn spectral features. In particular, we exploit that both the saturation of a specific defect line and the transition from excitonic to electron-hole-plasma recombination occur at well-defined carrier densities. We find that absorption is maximized for a diameter of about 80\,nm. Our approach may be transferred to other material systems and thus enables systematic experimental studies of absorption enhancement in single nanowires.</description>

      <title>Modelling conductive thermal transport in three-dimensional fibrous media with fiber-to-fiber contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding heat transfers in fibrous materials, particularly conduction, is a major challenge due to their heterogeneous and multiscale nature, and the unknown contribution of fiber-to-fiber contacts. In most previous modelling studies, the existence of thermal contact resistance is not considered, and the computational complexity often limits the size of simulated samples, which leads to imprecise of inaccurate predictions. The same problem arises when considering electrical conduction through fibrous materials. In this work, we describe a computationally efficient simulation approach based on multi-nodal representation to analyze the steady-state heat conduction through the solid structure in numerically generated 3D nanofiber networks, including contact resistance. We show that the solid conductivity in these networks is governed by a master curve that depends on a single parameter: a characteristic ratio representing the interplay between fiber intrinsic conductivity and contact resistance as well as the influence of other geometric parameters, which numerically validates previous theoretical studies. However, we observe a deviation to this established theory for poorly-connected networks. We derive an expression for a correction factor, considering the influence of correlations between fiber temperatures, and we find then good agreement with our simulation data. Our results demonstrate that the solid conductivity can be fully predicted based on geometric quantities, regardless of the extent of network connectivity, thus generalizing previous studies on this topic. This work, contributing to improve our understanding of conductive heat transport in fibrous media, may prove useful in the development of accurate predictive models and optimization strategies for fibrous insulation materials.</description>

      <title>Reviving networked multi-dimensional dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From gene regulatory networks to mutualistic networks, controlling a single node in the network topology can transform these complex dynamical systems from undesirable states to desirable ones. Corresponding methods have been well-studied in one-dimensional dynamical systems. However, many practical dynamical systems require description by multi-dimensional dynamical systems, such as the mutualistic symbiotic systems formed by flowering plants and pollinating insects. Existing one-dimensional methods cannot handle the cases of multi-dimensional dynamical systems. Based on this, we propose a method to control a single node to activate network connections in multi-dimensional dynamical systems. In such systems, the changes of each node are described by multiple nonlinear differential equations. All remaining nodes are stratified according to the shortest path to the controlled node, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the system. Such a large-scale dynamical system can ultimately be replaced by a very simple system. By analyzing the reduced-dimensional system, we can predict the extent of control needed to restore the system state. We apply this method to a wide range of fields, achieving activation of various real multidimensional complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Computation by non-Abelian Braiding in Classical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a realization of the one-dimensional Kitaev topological superconductor in classical mechanical metamaterials. By designing appropriate braiding protocols, we demonstrate that the system's mid-gap vibrational modes, termed classical Majorana zero modes (MZMs), accurately reproduce the braiding statistics predicted by quantum theory. Encoding four MZMs as a classical analog of a qubit, we implement all single-qubit Clifford gates through braiding, enabling the simulation of topological quantum computation in a classical system. Furthermore, we establish the system's topological protection by demonstrating its robustness against mechanical defects. This work provides a novel framework for exploring topological quantum computation using classical metamaterials and offers a pathway to realizing stable vibrational systems protected by topology.</description>

      <title>The surface binding and energy issues in rational design of the separation membrane of Li||S batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) represent one of the most promising next-generation energy storage technologies, offering exceptionally high energy densities. However, their widespread adoption remains hindered by challenges such as sluggish conversion reactions and the dissolution of lithium polysulfides, which lead to poor cycling stability and reduced performance. While significant efforts have been made to address these limitations, the energy storage capabilities of LSBs in practical devices remain far from achieving their full potential. This report delves into recent advancements in the rational design of separation membranes for LSBs, focusing on addressing fundamental issues related to surface binding and surface energy interactions within materials science. By examining the functionalization and optimization of separation membranes, we aim to highlight strategies that can guide the development of more robust and efficient LSBs, bringing them closer to practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Stabilized biskyrmion states in annealed CoFeB bilayer with different interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the stability of skyrmions and biskyrmions in perpendicular magnetic tunneling junctions with a thick CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB free layer. The samples showed a magnetoresistance of ~ 41% when annealed at 230 {\deg}C. Magnetic force microscopy revealed the existence of skyrmions and biskyrmions at room temperature in the as-deposited state and under an external magnetic field. Annealing at 330 {\deg}C enhanced interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and crystallinity, enabling the spontaneous coexistence of these topological structures. Micromagnetic simulations using MuMax3 explored the interplay between DMI strength, sign, and skyrmion chirality. Skyrmions exhibited repulsive interactions, while biskyrmions displayed attractive interactions due to the difference in helicities. The study highlights the influence of multilayer structure and varying Ta layer thicknesses on the DMI charility, which modulates the formation of complex spin textures. These results provide an understanding of skyrmion and biskyrmion dynamics and their potential for spintronic applications, including racetrack memory and data storage technologies.</description>

      <title>Full-film dry transfer of MBE-grown van der Waals materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) has been used to create high-quality, large-scale two-dimensional van der Waals (2D vdW) materials. However, due to the strong adhesion between the substrate and deposited materials, the peel-off and dry transfer of MBE-grown vdW films onto other substrates has been challenging. This limits the study and use of MBE films for heterogeneous integration including stacked and twisted heterostructures. In this work, we develop a polymer-assisted dry transfer method and successfully perform full-film transfer of various MBE-grown 2D vdW materials including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), topological insulators (TI) and 2D magnets. In particular, we transfer air-sensitive 2D magnets, characterize their magnetic properties, and compare them with as-grown materials. The results show that the transfer technique does not degrade the magnetic properties, with the Curie temperature and hysteresis loops exhibiting similar behaviors after the transfer. Our results enable further development of heterogeneous integration of 2D vdW materials based on MBE growth.</description>

      <title>Robust Microwave-Optical Photon Conversion Using Cavity Modes Strongly Hybridized with a Color Center Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A microwave-optical photon converter with high efficiency ($&gt;50$ %) and low added noise ($\ll 1$ photon) could enable the creation of scalable quantum networks where quantum information is distributed optically and processed in the microwave regime. However, integrated converters demonstrated to date lack sufficient co-operativity or are too lossy to provide the required performance. Here we propose a bi-directional microwave-optical converter employing an ensemble of spin-bearing color centers hosted within a high-Q Si photonic resonator and coupled magnetically to a high-Q superconducting microwave resonator. We develop a theory for microwave-optical conversion when the ensemble of centers is strongly hybridized with one or both cavities, and find a counterintuitive operating point where microwave and optical photons are tuned to bare center/cavity resonances. Compared to the perturbative coupling regime, we find a substantially enhanced nonlinearity, making it possible to obtain the required co-operativity with reduced pump- and center-induced losses, and improved robustness to optical inhomogeneous broadening. Taking color center and optical pump-induced losses into account in both the Si photonic and superconducting resonators, we find that $\sim 95$ % total efficiency and added noise $\ll 1$ quanta is possible at low ($\mu$W) pump powers for both Er- and T-centers in Si. Our results open new pathways towards quantum networks using microwave-optical converters.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature field-tunable radiofrequency rectification in epitaxial SrIrO3 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although significant advancements have been made in wireless technologies and portable devices, it remains a challenge for high-frequency and nanowatt-level radiofrequency rectification. In this work, we report a pronounced radiofrequency rectification up to 37 GHz in nominally centrosymmetric SrIrO3 epitaxial films, with the minimum detectable power as low as ~300 nanowatts. Strikingly, the SrIrO3 rectifier is highly field-tunable and exhibits a strong in-plane field anisotropy, thus showing a unique advantage in broad-band radiofrequency rectification. The rectification effect can persist up to at least 360 K and shows a sensitive temperature dependence including a sign inversion. By a systematic study of the nonlinear transport properties of SrIrO3, it is further revealed that the radiofrequency rectification originates from the nonlinear Hall effect with the dominant contribution from field-induced Berry curvature dipole. Our work demonstrates the superior performance of the field-tunable SrIrO3 rectifiers, unleashing the great application potential of centrosymmetric materials in harvesting and detecting ambient electromagnetic energy.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Performance Evaluation of Cs2CuBiCl6 Double Perovskite Solar Cell for Lead-Free Photovoltaic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the previous decade, there has been a significant advancement in the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterized by a notable increase in efficiency from 3.8% to 25%. Nonetheless, PSCs face many problems when we commercialize them because of their toxicity and stability. Consequently, lead-PSCs need an alternative solar cell with high performance and low processing cost; lead-free inorganic perovskites have been explored. Recent research showcased Cs2CuBiCl6, a lead-free inorganic double perovskite material with remarkable photoelectric characteristics and exceptional environmental robustness. To investigate the potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 material, the solar cell structure FTO/ETL/Cs2CuBiCl6/HTL/Au was used and analyzed through a solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). CeO2 is used as the Electron transport layer (ETL), and CuI is the Hole transport layer (HTL). Furthermore, the research examined the optimization of different parameters of the absorber layer (AL), such as thickness, defect density, electron affinity, band gap, and operational temperature. In the end, it has been noticed that by setting the temperature at 300 K and an electron affinity of 4.3 eV of the absorber layer, the PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 24.51 %, FF of 43.01 %, Voc of 1.73V, and Jsc of 32.82mA/cm2. This is the highest Cs2CuBiCl6 double PSCs efficiency we've reached yet. In theoretical studies, 17.03% of PCE was achieved using Cs2CuBiCl6 as an active layer. The analysis underscores the significant potential of Cs2CuBiCl6 as an absorbing layer in developing highly efficient lead-free all-inorganic PSCs.</description>

      <title>Mechanical non-reciprocity programmed by shear jamming in soft composite solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical non-reciprocity-manifested as asymmetric responses to opposing mechanical stimuli-has traditionally been achieved through intricate structural nonlinearities in metamaterials. However, continuum solids with inherent non-reciprocal mechanics remain underexplored, despite their promising potential for applications such as wave guiding, robotics, and adaptive materials. Here, we introduce a design principle by employing the shear jamming transition from granular physics to engineering non-reciprocal mechanics in soft composite solids. Through the control of the interplay between inclusion contact networks and matrix elasticity, we achieve tunable, direction-dependent asymmetry in both shear and normal mechanical responses. In addition to static regimes, we demonstrate programmable non-reciprocal dynamics by combining responsive magnetic profiles with the anisotropic characteristics of shear-jammed systems. This strategy enables asymmetric spatiotemporal control over motion transmission, a previously challenging feat in soft materials. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for designing non-reciprocal matter, bridging granular physics with soft material engineering to realize functionalities essential for mechano-intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Defects in the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2 MOS system and the effect of thermal treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the properties of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3(-201)/HfO2/Cr/Au MOS (metal-oxide-semiconductor) system after annealing (450oC) in different ambient conditions (forming gas, N2 and O2). Defect properties have been analyzed using an approach combining experimental impedance measurements with physics-based simulations of the capacitance-voltage (C-V) and conductance-voltage (G-V) characteristics of \b{eta}-Ga2O3/HfO2 MOS capacitors. This approach enabled us to detect two defect bands in HfO2 characterized by thermal ionization energies of ~1.1eV (acceptor-like) and ~2eV (donor-like) attributed to a polaronic self-trapping state and an oxygen vacancy in HfO2, respectively. This study demonstrates how thermal treatments affect the energy distributions and densities of the observed defects. The adopted methodology also enabled the extraction of the spatial distribution of defects across the HfO2 thickness and Cr/HfO2 interface. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies close to the Cr/HfO2 interface extracted from experimental and simulated electrical data is confirmed by in-situ XPS analysis which shows how Cr is scavenging oxygen from the HfO2 and creating the donor band confined near the Cr/HfO2 interface. This donor band density is observed to be reduced after annealing as per simulation and unchanged for different annealing conditions. We speculate this may be due to the formation of dense films and polyforms of HfO2 under different ambient as revealed by high-resolution TEM images.</description>

      <title>Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthorhombic-structured II-IV nitrides provide a promising opportunity to expand the material platform while maintaining compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the traditional III-nitride material system. Among them, MgSiN$_{2}$ stands out due to its close compatibility with GaN and AlN and its theoretically predicted ultrawide direct band gap of 6.28 eV. In this work, the growth of MgSiN$_{2}$ thin films on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates was investigated using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). MOCVD growth conditions were correlated with film quality and crystallinity for samples grown on GaN-on-sapphire substrates. The effects of Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratios and growth pressure at two different temperatures, 745$^{\circ}$C and 850$^{\circ}$C, were studied comprehensively. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging confirmed the formation of high-quality, single-crystal MgSiN$_{2}$ films. Optical band gap extraction from transmittance measurements yielded direct band gap values ranging from 6.13 eV to 6.27 eV for samples grown under various conditions, confirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap, III-nitride-compatible, II-IV-nitride material.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical poromechanical approach to investigate the impact of mechanical loading on human skin micro-circulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on human skin anatomy reveals its complex multi-scale, multi-phase nature, with up to 70% of its composition being bounded and free water. Fluid movement plays a key role in the skin's mechanical and biological responses, influencing its time-dependent behavior and nutrient transport.
  Poroelastic modeling is a promising approach for studying skin dynamics across scales by integrating multi-physics processes. This paper introduces a hierarchical two-compartment model capturing fluid distribution in the interstitium and micro-circulation. A theoretical framework is developed with a biphasic interstitium -- distinguishing interstitial fluid and non-structural cells -- and analyzed through a one-dimensional consolidation test of a column. This biphasic approach allows separate modeling of cell and fluid motion, considering their differing characteristic times. An appendix discusses extending the model to include biological exchanges like oxygen transport. Preliminary results indicate that cell viscosity introduces a second characteristic time, and at high viscosity and short time scales, cells behave similarly to solids.
  A simplified model was used to replicate an experimental campaign on short time scales. Local pressure (up to 31 kPa) was applied to dorsal finger skin using a laser Doppler probe PF801 (Perimed Sweden), following a setup described in Fromy Brain Res (1998). The model qualitatively captured ischemia and post-occlusive reactive hyperemia, aligning with experimental data.
  All numerical simulations used the open-source software FEniCSx v0.9.0. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, anonymized experimental data and finite element codes are publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Roll-to-roll tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing</title>

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) has revolutionized the fabrication of devices with precisely controlled optical, fluidic, mechanical, and filtering properties, offering greater design freedom than conventional manufacturing methods. Tomographic volumetric additive manufacturing (TVAM) has many advantages compared to other AM methods including smooth layer-less surfaces, support-free and shear force-free printing, material versatility, and speed of production which are translatable to the microscale and evident in printed microfluidic devices and micro-optical components. However, as the patterning scale is reduced, the depth of field of the optical projection system shrinks much more rapidly and does so roughly with the square of the patterning scale. Consequently, the build volume is substantially reduced as the numerical aperture of the system is increased. Additionally, microscale tomographic VAM is currently limited to batch production, i.e., the photoresist container must be exchanged after the exposure phase is completed. In this work, we introduce roll-to-roll (R2R) TVAM in which these limitations are addressed by "unwrapping" the precursor material into a film enabling continuous production of microstructures with theoretically unlimited length. We elaborate the design of a focus-multiplexed projection optical system that can scan the projection focal plane axially in sync with the refresh cycle of a digital micromirror device. We describe the process of iteratively optimizing and segmenting sinograms to produce long aperiodic microstructures with the focus-tunable optical system. Furthermore, we formulate a thermally reversible organogel photoresist which is deposited onto the substrate in films several millimeters in thickness. Finally, we demonstrate printing of complex lattice structures with length more than 60 cm and minimum feature size of 200 um with the R2R TVAM system.</description>

      <title>Terahertz channel power and BER performance in rain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communications have emerged as a promising technology for 6G networks due to their potential for achieving terabit-per-second data rates. However, the impact of rainfall on THz channel characteristics remains incompletely understood, particularly regarding power attenuation mechanisms and bit error rate (BER) performance. This article presents a systematic measurement-based and theoretical investigation of line-of-sight (LoS) THz channel behavior under rainfall conditions, methodically examining both power attenuation mechanisms and bit error rate (BER) performance. Our experimental campaign, conducted at frequencies of 220-230 GHz over a 54-meter outdoor channel, is complemented by analytical frameworks incorporating ITU-R and Mie scattering models. The study reveals that while rain induces significant power attenuation, multipath scattering effects remain minimal, with Rician K-factors maintaining high values. Notably, we observe substantial variations in power loss under constant rain rates, attributed to dynamic changes in raindrop size distribution. Comparative analysis demonstrates superior BER performance of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) in rainfall conditions, while revealing increased environmental sensitivity at higher frequencies. These findings underscore the necessity for adaptive modulation schemes and strategic frequency planning in future THz communication systems.</description>

      <title>Planar 3$\omega$ and 2$\omega$ Method for Increased Sensitivity to Through-Plane Thermal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately measuring the thermal properties of buried interfaces is crucial for understanding heat transport in multilayered materials, particularly in applications such as batteries and integrated circuits. The conventional 3$\omega$ method, which uses a line heater, has limited sensitivity to through-plane thermal properties due to lateral heat spreading, especially when a highly conductive layer overlays a resistive one. Additionally, when using a line heater, there is a lower limit to the frequency of heating, below which the analytical solution assuming infinite lateral dimension is not valid. This limits analytical interpretation of 2$\omega$ temperature oscillation at lower frequencies where the sensitivity to the conductivity of a buried layer is greater. To overcome these limitations, we propose a planar 3$\omega$ and 2$\omega$ method that enhances the sensitivity to buried layers by ensuring planar heat flow. We implement this technique using a planar metallic heater across the entire sample and validate it experimentally against the analytical solution using Feldman's algorithm. We also discuss the practical implementation details of the approach, including ensuring uniform current distribution and the required sensor layout. Our results demonstrate improved measurement sensitivity for polymer layers in silicon stacks and buried interfaces in battery electrodes, with sensitivity improvements by factors of 2-5 compared to conventional technique using a line heater.</description>

      <title>Integrated lithium niobate photonic millimeter-wave radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave,&gt;30 GHz) radars are the key enabler in the coming 6G era for high-resolution sensing and detection of targets. Photonic radar provides an effective approach to overcome the limitations of electronic radars thanks to the high frequency, broad bandwidth, and excellent reconfigurability of photonic systems. However, conventional photonic radars are mostly realized in tabletop systems composed of bulky discrete components, whereas the more compact integrated photonic radars are difficult to reach the mmWave bands due to the unsatisfactory bandwidths and signal integrity of the underlining electro-optic modulators. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a centimeter-resolution integrated photonic radar operating in the mmWave V band (40-50 GHz) based on a 4-inch wafer-scale thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology. The fabricated TFLN mmWave photonic integrated circuit consists of a first electro-optic modulator capable of generating a broadband linear frequency modulated mmWave radar waveform through optical frequency multiplication of a low-frequency input signal, and a second electro-optic modulator responsible for frequency de-chirp of the received reflected echo wave, therefore greatly relieving the bandwidth requirements for the analog-to-digital converter in the receiver. Thanks to the absence of optical and electrical filters in the system, our integrated photonic mmWave radar features continuous on-demand tunability of the center frequency and bandwidth, currently only limited by the bandwidths of electrical amplifiers. We achieve multi-target ranging with a resolution of 1.50 cm and velocity measurement with a resolution of 0.067 m/s. Furthermore, we construct an inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) and successfully demonstrate the imaging of targets with various shapes and postures with a two-dimensional resolution of 1.50 cm * 1.06 cm.</description>
