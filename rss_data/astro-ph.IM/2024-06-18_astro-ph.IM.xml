      <title>Spatial and Spectral Characterization of the Gravitational-wave Background with the PTA Optimal Statistic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have made tremendous progress and are now showing strong evidence for the gravitational-wave background (GWB). Further probing the origin and characteristics of the GWB will require more generalized analysis techniques. Bayesian methods are most often used but can be computationally expensive. On the other hand, frequentist methods, like the PTA Optimal Statistic (OS), are more computationally efficient and can produce results that are complementary to Bayesian methods, allowing for stronger statistical cases to be built from a confluence of different approaches. In this work we expand the capabilities of the OS through a technique we call the Per-Frequency Optimal Statistic (PFOS). The PFOS removes the underlying power-law assumption inherent in previous implementations of the OS, and allows one to estimate the GWB spectrum in a frequency-by-frequency manner. We have also adapted a recent generalization from the OS pipeline into the PFOS, making it capable of accurately characterizing the spectrum in the intermediate and strong GW signal regimes using only a small fraction of the necessary computational resources when compared with fully-correlated Bayesian methods, while also empowering many new types of analyses not possible before. We find that even in the strong GW signal regime, where the GWB dominates over noise in all frequencies, the injected value of the signal lies within the 50th-percentile of the PFOS uncertainty distribution in 41-45% of simulations, remaining 3$\sigma$-consistent with unbiased estimation.</description>

      <title>Towards an astronomical use of new-generation geodetic observations. I. From the correlator to full-polarization images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The current algorithms used for the calibration and analysis of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) networks that only use linear polarizers (as is the case of the VLBI Global Observing System, VGOS) do not properly account for instrumental and source-intrinsic polarimetry, which can cause errors in geodetic and astronomical products. Aims. We aim to develop a calibration pipeline for VLBI interferometers that observe in a basis of linear polarization, as is the case of VGOS. The products from this pipeline can be used to obtain valuable full-polarization astronomical information from the observed sources, and they can be used to potentially improve the geodetic results. Methods. We used the algorithm PolConvert to write the correlation products in a basis of circular polarization that is compatible with the standard VLBI calibration procedures. In addition to this, we implemented a wide-band global fringe-fitting algorithm that accounts for dispersive effects (ionospheric delay) and allows us to perform full-polarization imaging of all the observed sources, covering the whole frequency band of VGOS. Results. We present the outcome of our pipeline applied to a global IVS VGOS epoch of observations and show example imaging results in total intensity and polarization. We also discuss issues encountered during the analysis and suggest points of improvement in the VGOS system for an optimum geodetic and astronomical exploitation of this interferometer.</description>

      <title>Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 &lt; a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 &lt; a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Modeling optical systematics for the Taurus CMB experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate a variety of optical systematics for Taurus, a balloon-borne cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarisation experiment, to assess their impact on large-scale E-mode polarisation measurements and constraints of the optical depth to reionisation {\tau}. We model a one-month flight of Taurus from Wanaka, New Zealand aboard a super-pressure balloon (SPB). We simulate night-time scans of both the CMB and dust foregrounds in the 150GHz band, one of Taurus's four observing bands. We consider a variety of possible systematics that may affect Taurus's observations, including non-gaussian beams, pointing reconstruction error, and half-wave plate (HWP) non-idealities. For each of these, we evaluate the residual power in the difference between maps simulated with and without the systematic, and compare this to the expected signal level corresponding to Taurus's science goals. Our results indicate that most of the HWP-related systematics can be mitigated to be smaller than sample variance by calibrating with Planck's TT spectrum and using an achromatic HWP model, with a preference for five layers of sapphire to ensure good systematic control. However, additional beam characterization will be required to mitigate far-sidelobe pickup from dust on larger scales.</description>

      <title>The projected sensitivity of SCEP experiment to Magnetic Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The investigation of beyond-Standard-Model particles is a compelling direction in the pursuit of new physics. One such hypothetical particle, the magnetic monopole, has garnered considerable attention due to its strong theoretical motivation and potential to unveil profound physical phenomena. The magnetic monopole is intricately linked to the long-standing enigma surrounding the quantization of electric charge. In this manuscript, we propose a novel detection scenario for magnetic monopoles by employing a coincidence measurement technique that combines a room-temperature magnetometer with plastic scintillators. This setup allows for the collection of both the induction and scintillation signals generated by the passage of a monopole. The estimation of the sensitivity using a simple benchmark setup is given.</description>

      <title>Light curve's recovery with Rubin-LSST: II. UnVEiling the darknesS of The gAlactic buLgE (VESTALE) with RR Lyrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is part of VESTALE, a project initiated within the Rubin-LSST Cadence Strategy Optimization Process . Its goal is to explore the potential of Rubin-LSST observations aimed at the Galaxy's bulge (Bulge) for studying RR Lyrae stars (RRL). Observation and analysis of RR Lyrae stars in the Bulge are crucial for tracing the old population of the central part of our galaxy and reconstructing the history of Bulge formation. Based on observations conducted with CTIO/DECam by Saha et al. 2019 towards the Baade Window, our simulations demonstrate that early Rubin-LSST observations will enable the recovery of RR Lyrae light curves at Galactic center distances with sufficient precision. This will allow us to utilize theoretical relations from Marconi et al. 2022 to determine their distances and/or metallicity, following the REDIME algorithm introduced in Bono et al. 2019. We show how reddening and crowding affect our simulations and highlight the importance of considering these effects when deriving pulsation parameters (luminosity amplitudes, mean magnitudes) based on the light curves especially if the goal is to explore the opposite side of the Bulge through the observation of its RRL. The simulations discussed in this investigation were conducted to support the SCOC's decision to observe this important sky region since it has only recently been decided to include part of the Bulge as a target within the LSST main survey.</description>

      <title>Transformer models for astrophysical time series and the GRB prompt-afterglow relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models have recently become very successful in the natural language domain. Their value as sequence-to-sequence translators there, also makes them a highly interesting technique for learning relationships between astrophysical time series. Our aim is investigate how well such a transformer neural network can establish causal temporal relations between different channels of a single-source signal. We thus apply a transformer model to the two phases of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), reconstructing one phase from the other. GRBs are unique instances where a single process and event produces two distinct time variable phenomena: the prompt emission and the afterglow. We here investigate if a transformer model can predict the afterglow flux from the prompt emission. If successful, such a predictive scheme might then be distilled to the most important underlying physics drivers in the future. We combine the transformer model with a novel dense neural network setup to directly estimate the starting value of the prediction. We find that the transformer model can, in some instances, successfully predict different phases of canonical afterglows, including the plateau phase. Hence it is a useful and promising new astrophysical analysis technique. For the GRB test case, the method marginally exceeds the baseline model overall, but still achieves accurate recovery of the prompt-afterglow fluence-fluence correlation in reconstructed light curves. Despite this progress, we conclude that consistent improvement over the baseline model is not yet achieved for the GRB case. We discuss the future improvements in data and modeling that are required to identify new physical-relation parameters or new insights into the single process driving both GRB phases.</description>

      <title>Predicting the energetic proton flux with a machine learning regression algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need of real-time of monitoring and alerting systems for Space Weather hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most important challenge for space mission operations and planning is the prediction of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these models aim to predict the occurrence of a SPE, i.e., they are based on the classification approach. In this work we present a simple and efficient machine learning regression algorithm which is able to forecast the energetic proton flux up to 1 hour ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux only. This approach could be helpful to improve monitoring systems of the radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars distance.</description>

      <title>Windows Into Other Worlds: Pitfalls in the physical interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric spectroscopy provides a window into the properties of exoplanets. However, the physical interpretation of retrieved data and its implications for the internal properties of exoplanets remains nebulous. This letter addresses three misconceptions held by some atmospheric spectroscopists regarding the connection between observed chemical abundances and theory: (1) Whether atmospheric spectroscopy can provide the bulk atmospheric chemistry, (2) whether it can identify if a planet is cloudless, and (3) whether atmospheric evaporation arguments can be used to dismiss certain compositions inferred through spectroscopy. This letter concludes by exploring applications of remote sensing in the quest for the search for life outside of our solar system.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Detection of Unmodelled Gravitational-Wave Transients Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.14611v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated potential for the real-time analysis of data from gravitational-wave detector networks for the specific case of signals from coalescing compact-object binaries such as black-hole binaries. Unfortunately, training these CNNs requires a precise model of the target signal; they are therefore not applicable to a wide class of potential gravitational-wave sources, such as core-collapse supernovae and long gamma-ray bursts, where unknown physics or computational limitations prevent the development of comprehensive signal models. We demonstrate for the first time a CNN with the ability to detect generic signals -- those without a precise model -- with sensitivity across a wide parameter space. Our CNN has a novel structure that uses not only the network strain data but also the Pearson cross-correlation between detectors to distinguish correlated gravitational-wave signals from uncorrelated noise transients. We demonstrate the efficacy of our CNN using data from the second LIGO-Virgo observing run, and show that it has sensitivity comparable to that of the "gold-standard" transient searches currently used by LIGO-Virgo, at extremely low (order of 1 second) latency and using only a fraction of the computing power required by existing searches, allowing our models the possibility of true real-time detection of gravitational-wave transients associated with gamma-ray bursts, core-collapse supernovae, and other relativistic astrophysical phenomena.</description>

Abstract: The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 48 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly meant provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.</description>

      <title>Efficient PSF Modeling with ShOpt.jl: A PSF Benchmarking Study with JWST NIRCam Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With their high angular resolutions of 30--100 mas, large fields of view, and complex optical systems, imagers on next-generation optical/near-infrared space observatories, such as the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), present both new opportunities for science and also new challenges for empirical point spread function (PSF) characterization. In this context, we introduce ShOpt, a new PSF fitting tool developed in Julia and designed to bridge the advanced features of PIFF (PSFs in the Full Field of View) with the computational efficiency of PSFEx (PSF Extractor). Along with ShOpt, we propose a suite of non-parametric statistics suitable for evaluating PSF fit quality in space-based imaging. Our study benchmarks ShOpt against the established PSF fitters PSFEx and PIFF using real and simulated COSMOS-Web Survey imaging. We assess their respective PSF model fidelity with our proposed diagnostic statistics and investigate their computational efficiencies, focusing on their processing speed relative to the complexity and size of the PSF models. We find that ShOpt can already achieve PSF model fidelity comparable to PSFEx and PIFF while maintaining competitive processing speeds, constructing PSF models for large NIRCam mosaics within minutes.</description>

      <title>An Autonomous Vision-Based Algorithm for Interplanetary Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09590</link>

Abstract: The surge of deep-space probes makes it unsustainable to navigate them with standard radiometric tracking. Self-driving interplanetary satellites represent a solution to this problem. In this work, a full vision-based navigation algorithm is built by combining an orbit determination method with an image processing pipeline suitable for interplanetary transfers of autonomous platforms. To increase the computational efficiency of the algorithm, a non-dimensional extended Kalman filter is selected as state estimator, fed by the positions of the planets extracted from deep-space images. An enhancement of the estimation accuracy is performed by applying an optimal strategy to select the best pair of planets to track. Moreover, a novel analytical measurement model for deep-space navigation is developed providing a first-order approximation of the light-aberration and light-time effects. Algorithm performance is tested on a high-fidelity, Earth--Mars interplanetary transfer, showing the algorithm applicability for deep-space navigation.</description>

      <title>New lower background and higher rate technique for anti-neutrino detection using Tungsten 183 Isotope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low energy anti-neutrinos detected from reactors or other sources have typically used the conversion of an anti-neutrino on Hydrogen, producing a positron and a free neutron. This neutron is subsequently captured on a secondary element with a large neutron capture cross section such as gadolinium or cadmium. We have studied the anti-neutrino conversion and suggest other elements that have a comparable cross section for anti-neutrino reactions. With most neutron captures on gadolinium, it is possible to get two or three delayed gamma signals of known energy to occur. Experiments like ATLAS can make measurements with timing on the order of 25 ns. With electronics like these, this leads to the possibility of having a triple delayed coincidence using the positron annihilation on atomic shell electrons as the starting signal. We have also found an isotope of tungsten, $^{183}$W that offers a large anti-neutrino interaction cross section of $1.19 \times 10^{-46}$ m$^2$ and an anti-neutrino threshold energy for the production of the ground state at 2.094 MeV and the production of the first excited state at 2.167 MeV. This reaction makes a nuclear m1 excited state of $^{183}$Ta$^*$ that emits a signature secondary gamma pulse of 73 keV with a 106 ns half-life. This offers a new delayed coincidence technique that can be used to identify anti-neutrinos with lower background noise. This allows for less shielding than required for modern inverse beta decay detectors.</description>

      <title>Class Symbolic Regression: Gotta Fit 'Em All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce 'Class Symbolic Regression' (Class SR) a first framework for automatically finding a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each realization being governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters. This hierarchical framework leverages the common constraint that all the members of a single class of physical phenomena follow a common governing law. Our approach extends the capabilities of our earlier Physical Symbolic Optimization ($\Phi$-SO) framework for Symbolic Regression, which integrates dimensional analysis constraints and deep reinforcement learning for unsupervised symbolic analytical function discovery from data. Additionally, we introduce the first Class SR benchmark, comprising a series of synthetic physical challenges specifically designed to evaluate such algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel approach by applying it to these benchmark challenges and showcase its practical utility for astrophysics by successfully extracting an analytic galaxy potential from a set of simulated orbits approximating stellar streams.</description>

      <title>Natural-linewidth measurements of the 3C and 3D soft-x-ray transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft-x-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15\,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Followup Could Have Enabled the Discovery of the GW190425 Kilonova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a kilonova associated with the GW170817 binary neutron star merger had far-reaching implications for our understanding of several open questions in physics and astrophysics. Unfortunately, since then, only one robust binary neutron star merger was detected through gravitational waves, GW190425, and no electromagnetic counterpart was identified for it. We analyze all reported electromagnetic followup observations of GW190425 and find that while the gravitational-wave localization uncertainty was large, most of the 90% probability region could have been covered within hours had the search been coordinated. Instead, more than 5 days after the merger, the uncoordinated search covered only 50% of the probability, with some areas observed over 100 times, and some never observed. We further show that, according to some models, it would have been possible to detect the GW190425 kilonova, despite the larger distance and higher component masses compared to GW170817. These results emphasize the importance of coordinating followup of gravitational-wave events, not only to avoid missing future kilonovae, but also to discover them early. Such coordination, which is especially important given the rarity of these events, can be achieved with the Treasure Map, a tool developed specifically for this purpose.</description>

      <title>Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions. In Paper I, we examined the performance of the fiducial second-generation TDI Michelson configuration versus an alternative, the hybrid Relay, in noise suppression and data analysis. The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance could be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with the null stream from Sagnac configuration. The combined data streams, two science observables from the hybrid Relay and a null observable from the Sagnac, could form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.</description>
