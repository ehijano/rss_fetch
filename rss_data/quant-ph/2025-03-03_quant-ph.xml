      <title>Macroscopic quantum distinguishablity, identity and irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basic characteristics of the classical many-particle (''macroscopic'') systems are notoriously hard to reproduce in quantum theory. In this paper we show that this is not the case for certain many-particle systems within the recently introduced theory of emergent local quantum times, the so-called, Local Time Scheme. For an isolated many-particle system consisting of large number of (approximately) isolated subsystems, distinguishability and individuality can be naturally and straightforwardly obtained. In effect, a single such many-particle system quickly evolves between the mutually approximately orthogonal states thus setting a trajectory in the state space that is not shared with any other such individual many-particle system. Irreversibility of such dynamical processes is justified for the individual systems but not for the statistical ensembles of such systems. As an application, we derive a genuine nonexponential law for decay of unstable systems, in accordance with some theoretical expectations. This, classically plausible, picture calls for detailed analysis regarding the relativistic causality and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Equivalence Principle in Nonrelativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a precise quantum formulation of Einstein's Equivalence Principle (EEP) is developed within the framework of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. By employing detailed analyses in both the Schr\"odinger and Heisenberg pictures, it is demonstrated that an observer in free fall in a uniform gravitational field is equivalent to an inertial observer in the absence of such a field. The transformations of the wave function are reexamined, and the conditions for the equality of inertial and gravitational mass are established -- thereby consistently deriving the gravitational redshift observed in neutron interferometry experiments. Additionally, relevant applications of the proposed formalism are explored in confined systems (such as particles in potential boxes and in linear potential barriers), elucidating quantum tunneling phenomena and their dependence on energy levels. The results reaffirm the validity of the Equivalence Principle in the nonrelativistic quantum regime and open new perspectives for integrating quantum mechanics and general relativity.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration in Clifford Circuits and Beyond: From Random Tensor Networks to Pseudo-Magic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anticoncentration describes how an ensemble of quantum states spreads over the allowed Hilbert space, leading to statistically uniform output probability distributions. In this work, we investigate the anticoncentration of random Clifford circuits toward the overlap distribution of random stabilizer states. Using exact analytical techniques and extensive numerical simulations based on Clifford replica tensor networks, we demonstrate that random Clifford circuits fully anticoncentrate in logarithmic circuit depth, namely higher-order moments of the overlap distribution converge to those of random stabilizer states. Moreover, we investigate the effect of introducing a controlled number of non-Clifford (magic) resources into Clifford circuits. We show that inserting a polylogarithmic in qudit number of $T$-states is sufficient to drive the overlap distribution toward the Porter-Thomas statistics, effectively recovering full quantum randomness. In short, this fact presents doped tensor networks and shallow Clifford circuits as pseudo-magic quantum states. Our results clarify the interplay between Clifford dynamics, magic resource injection, and quantum complexity, with implications for quantum circuit sampling and benchmarking of computational quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Limits to the validity of quantum-optical models of the effects of gravitational redshift on photonic quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the domain of validity of a quantum optical model describing the effects of gravitational redshift on the quantum state of photons that propagate in curved spacetime. We find that the model is consistent for small redshift, but fails for larger redshifts. Surprisingly, the range of the redshift for which the model applies is conditional not only to the gravitational parameters, but also to those that define the photonic modes. We provide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution. Finally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the development of quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Atom Loss Errors in Fault Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Errors associated with qubit loss constitute an important source of noise in many quantum hardware systems, particularly in neutral atom quantum computers. We develop a theoretical framework to handle these errors in logical algorithms, incorporating decoding techniques and circuit-level optimizations. Focusing on experimentally-motivated error models, we introduce a delayed-erasure decoder which leverages information from state-selective readout to accurately correct loss errors, even when their precise locations are unknown. Our decoding technique is compatible with a wide range of quantum error correction codes and general logical circuits. Using this decoder, we identify strategies for detecting and correcting atom loss based on the logical circuit structure. For deep circuits with a large number of gate layers prior to logical measurements, we explore methods to integrate loss detection into syndrome extraction with minimal overhead, identifying optimal strategies depending on the qubit loss fraction in the noise. In contrast, many algorithmic subroutines involve frequent gate teleportation, shortening the circuit depth before logical measurement and naturally replacing qubits without additional overhead. We simulate such a teleportation-based algorithm, involving a toy model for small-angle synthesis and find a significant improvement in logical error rates as the loss fraction increases, with loss handled solely through teleportation. These results provide a path forward for advancing large-scale fault tolerant quantum computation in systems with loss errors.</description>

      <title>A finite sufficient set of conditions for catalytic majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majorization relation has found numerous applications in mathematics, quantum information and resource theory, and quantum thermodynamics, where it describes the allowable transitions between two physical states. In many cases, when state vector $x$ does not majorize state vector $y$, it is nevertheless possible to find a catalyst - another vector $z$ such that $x \otimes z$ majorizes $y \otimes z$. Determining the feasibility of such catalytic transformation typically involves checking an infinite set of inequalities. Here, we derive a finite sufficient set of inequalities that imply catalysis. Extending this framework to thermodynamics, we also establish a finite set of sufficient conditions for catalytic state transformations under thermal operations. For novel examples, we provide a software toolbox implementing these conditions.</description>

      <title>Encodings of Observable Subalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating complex systems remains an ongoing challenge for classical computers, while being recognised as a task where a quantum computer has a natural advantage. In both digital and analogue quantum simulations the system description is first mapped onto qubits or the physical system of the analogue simulator by an encoding. Previously mathematical definitions and characterisations of encodings have focused on preserving the full physics of the system. In this work, we consider encodings that only preserve a subset of the observables of the system. We motivate that such encodings are best described as maps between formally real Jordan algebras describing the subset of observables. Our characterisation of encodings is general, but notably holds for maps between finite-dimensional and semisimple $C^{*}$-algebras. Fermionic encodings are a pertinent example where a mathematical characterisation was absent. Our work applies to encodings of the the full CAR algebra, but also to encodings of just the even parity sector, corresponding to the physically relevant fermionic operators.</description>

      <title>Direct Analysis of Zero-Noise Extrapolation: Polynomial Methods, Error Bounds, and Simultaneous Physical-Algorithmic Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used quantum error mitigation technique that artificially amplifies circuit noise and then extrapolates the results to the noise-free circuit. A common ZNE approach is Richardson extrapolation, which relies on polynomial interpolation. Despite its simplicity, efficient implementations of Richardson extrapolation face several challenges, including approximation errors from the non-polynomial behavior of noise channels, overfitting due to polynomial interpolation, and exponentially amplified measurement noise. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges, presenting bias and variance bounds that quantify approximation errors. Additionally, for any precision $\varepsilon$, our results offer an estimate of the necessary sample complexity. We further extend the analysis to polynomial least squares-based extrapolation, which mitigates measurement noise and avoids overfitting. Finally, we propose a strategy for simultaneously mitigating circuit and algorithmic errors in the Trotter-Suzuki algorithm by jointly scaling the time step size and the noise level. This strategy provides a practical tool to enhance the reliability of near-term quantum computations. We support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Balancing Thermal Relaxation Deviations of Near-Future Quantum Computing Results via Bit-Inverted Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the predominant causes of program distortion in the real quantum computing system may be attributed to the probability deviation caused by thermal relaxation. We introduce Barber (Balancing reAdout Results using Bit-invErted ciRcuits), a method designed to counteract the asymmetric thermal relaxation deviation and improve the reliability of near-term quantum programs. Barber collaborates with a bit-inverted quantum circuit, where the excited quantum state of qubits is assigned to the $\lvert 0 \rangle$ and the unexcited state to the $\lvert 1 \rangle$. In doing so, bit-inverted quantum circuits can experience thermal relaxation in the opposite direction compared to standard quantum circuits. Barber can effectively suppress the thermal relaxation deviation in program's readout results by selectively merging distributions from the standard and bit-inverted circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum state discrimination in a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system of a single trapped ion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate an unambiguous quantum state discrimination of two qubit states under a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian with parity-time-reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry in a single trapped $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ion. We show that any two non-orthogonal states can become orthogonal subjected to time evolution of a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian in both the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry preserving and broken regimes, thus can be discriminated deterministically. For a given pair of candidate states, we show that the parameters of the Hamiltonian must be confined in a proper range, within which there exists an optimal choice to realize quantum brachistochrone for the fastest orthogonalization. Besides, we provide a clear geometric picture and some analytic results to understand the main conclusions. Our work shows a promising application of non-Hermitian physics in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the transformer density operator ansatz for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting steady states.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the ans\"atze in quantum language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum language models are the alternative to classical language models, which borrow concepts and methods from quantum machine learning and computational linguistics. While several quantum natural language processing (QNLP) methods and frameworks exist for text classification and generation, there is a lack of systematic study to compare the performance across various ans\"atze, in terms of their hyperparameters and classical and quantum methods to implement them. Here, we evaluate the performance of quantum natural language processing models based on these ans\"atze at different levels in text classification tasks. We perform a comparative study and optimize the QNLP models by fine-tuning several critical hyperparameters. Our results demonstrate how the balance between simplification and expressivity affects model performance. This study provides extensive data to improve our understanding of QNLP models and opens the possibility of developing better QNLP algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity measurements of the microwave electric field are important in applications of communication and metrology. \replaced{The sensitivity of traditional Rydberg superheterodyne receivers in free space is effectively determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is often considered equivalent to sensitivity in practical sensing applications.}{The sensitivity of the traditional Rydberg superheterodyne receivers in free space is limited by signal-to-noise contrast.} In this work, we demonstrate a cavity-enhanced receiver, where an optical cavity significantly amplifies the interaction between the probe light and cesium atoms, which substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio via enhancing the expansion coefficient \( \kappa \). \added{Here, $\kappa$ is the edge slope of the single peak obtained by fitting the double-peak EIT-AT spectrum, characterizing the response of the probe light to the frequency detuning of the coupling laser.}The sensitivity is thus boosted by a factor of approximately 19 dB. This study highlights the pivotal role of optical cavities in advancing Rydberg-based detection systems, offering a promising approach for high-sensitivity microwave electric field measurements.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the coherence time of a neutral atom by an optical quartic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherence time of an optically trapped neutral atom is a crucial parameter for quantum technologies. We found that optical dipole traps with higher-order spatial forms inherently offer lower decoherence rates compared to those with lower-order spatial forms. We formulated the decoherence rate caused by the variance of the differential energy shift and photon jumping rate. Then, we constructed blue-detuned harmonic and quartic optical dipole traps, and experimentally investigated the coherence time of a trapped single cesium atom. The experimental results qualitatively verified our theory. Our approach provides a novel method to enhance the coherence time of optically trapped neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Quantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and chemistry. Recent advancements in quantum hardware have opened new avenues for addressing this challenge. Inspired by the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) algorithm [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], which was originally designed for sampling the Boltzmann distribution of classical spin models using quantum computers, we introduce a quantum-assisted variational Monte Carlo (QA-VMC) algorithm for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems by adapting QeMCMC to sample the distribution of a (neural-network) wave function in VMC. The central question is whether such quantum-assisted proposal can potentially offer a computational advantage over classical methods. Through numerical investigations for the Fermi-Hubbard model and hydrogen chains, we demonstrate that the quantum-assisted proposal exhibits larger absolute spectral gaps and reduced autocorrelation times compared to conventional classical proposals, leading to more efficient sampling and faster convergence to the ground state in VMC as well as more accurate and precise estimation of physical observables. This advantage is especially pronounced for specific parameter ranges, where the ground-state configurations are more concentrated in some configurations separated by large Hamming distances. Our results underscore the potential of quantum-assisted algorithms to enhance classical variational methods for solving the ground state of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Can Bohmian mechanics be considered complete?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work celebrating the centenary of quantum mechanics, we rewiev the principles of de Broglie Bohm theory, also known as pilot-wave theory and Bohmian mechanics. We assess the most common reading of it (the Nomological interpretation based on the notion of primitive ontology in tridimensional space) and defend instead a more causal and pluralistic approach, drawing on classical analogies with optics and hydrodynamics. Within this framework, we review some of the approaches exploiting mechanical analogies to overcome the limitations of current Bohmian theory and perhaps quantum mechanics itself.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Block Encodings for Quantum Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum linear system solvers like the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) require a block encoding of the system matrix $A$ within a unitary operator $U_A$. Unfortunately, block encoding often results in significant subnormalisation and increase in the matrix's effective condition number $\kappa$, affecting the efficiency of solvers. Matrix preconditioning is a well-established classical technique to reduce $\kappa$ by multiplying $A$ by a preconditioner $P$. Here, we study quantum preconditioning for block encodings. We consider four preconditioners and two encoding approaches: (a) separately encoding $A$ and its preconditioner $P$, followed by quantum multiplication, and (b) classically multiplying $A$ and $P$ before encoding the product in $U_{PA}$. Their impact on subnormalisation factors and condition number $\kappa$ are analysed using practical matrices from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Our results show that (a) quantum multiplication introduces excessive subnormalisation factors, negating improvements in $\kappa$. We introduce preamplified quantum multiplication to reduce subnormalisation, which is of independent interest. Conversely, we see that (b) encoding of the classical product can significantly improve the effective condition number using the Sparse Approximate Inverse preconditioner with infill. Further, we introduce a new matrix filtering technique that reduces the circuit depth without adversely affecting the matrix solution. We apply these methods to reduce the number of QSVT phase factors by a factor of 25 for an example CFD matrix of size 1024x1024.</description>

      <title>Digital-Controlled Method of Conveyor-Belt Spin Shuttling in Silicon for Large-Scale Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a digital-controlled conveyor-belt shuttling method for silicon-based quantum processors, addressing the scalability challenges of conventional analog sinusoidal implementations. By placing a switch matrix and low-pass filters in a cryogenic environment, our approach synthesizes near-sinusoidal waveforms from a limited number of DC voltage levels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fidelity comparable to analog methods while significantly reducing wiring overhead and power dissipation. Moreover, the design offers robustness against device-level variations, enabling large-scale integration of high-fidelity spin shuttling for quantum error correction.</description>

      <title>LarQucut: A New Cutting and Mapping Approach for Large-sized Quantum Circuits in Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is a promising way to achieve large-scale quantum computing. However, mapping large-sized quantum circuits in DQC is a challenging job; for example, it is difficult to find an ideal cutting and mapping solution when many qubits, complicated qubit operations, and diverse QPUs are involved. In this study, we propose LarQucut, a new quantum circuit cutting and mapping approach for large-sized circuits in DQC. LarQucut has several new designs. (1) LarQucut can have cutting solutions that use fewer cuts, and it does not cut a circuit into independent sub-circuits, therefore reducing the overall cutting and computing overheads. (2) LarQucut finds isomorphic sub-circuits and reuses their execution results. So, LarQucut can reduce the number of sub-circuits that need to be executed to reconstruct the large circuit's output, reducing the time spent on sampling the sub-circuits. (3) We design an adaptive quantum circuit mapping approach, which identifies qubit interaction patterns and accordingly enables the best-fit mapping policy in DQC. The experimental results show that, for large circuits with hundreds to thousands of qubits in DQC, LarQucut can provide a better cutting and mapping solution with lower overall overheads and achieves results closer to the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Analytic Formulas for Quantum Discord of Special Families of N-Qubit States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum discord, a key indicator of non-classical correlations in bipartite systems, has been recently extended to multipartite scenarios [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2020, 124:110401]. We present exact analytic formulas for the quantum discord of special families of N-qubit states, including generalized class of GHZ states. Our formulations span $2$, $3$, $4n$, $4n+1$, $4n+2$, and $4n+3$-qubit configurations where $n\in 1, 2, \ldots$, which refine the assessment of quantum correlations and provide an analytical tool in quantum computation. Moreover, we uncover a ``discord freezing'' in even-qubit systems under phase flip decoherence which provides a means for preserving quantum coherence in environmental perturbations.</description>

      <title>AutoQML: A Framework for Automated Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has significantly advanced the efficiency of ML-focused software development by automating hyperparameter optimization and pipeline construction, reducing the need for manual intervention. Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers the potential to surpass classical machine learning (ML) capabilities by utilizing quantum computing. However, the complexity of QML presents substantial entry barriers. We introduce \emph{AutoQML}, a novel framework that adapts the AutoML approach to QML, providing a modular and unified programming interface to facilitate the development of QML pipelines. AutoQML leverages the QML library sQUlearn to support a variety of QML algorithms. The framework is capable of constructing end-to-end pipelines for supervised learning tasks, ensuring accessibility and efficacy. We evaluate AutoQML across four industrial use cases, demonstrating its ability to generate high-performing QML pipelines that are competitive with both classical ML models and manually crafted quantum solutions.</description>

      <title>Improving error suppression with noise-aware decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of quantum error correction can be improved with noise-aware decoders, which are calibrated to the likelihood of physical error configurations in a device. Averaged circuit eigenvalue sampling (ACES) is a Pauli noise characterisation technique that can calibrate decoders at the scales required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. We demonstrate that ACES is practically capable of calibrating a fast correlated matching decoder, enabling noise-aware decoding, in circuit-level numerical simulations of the surface code. We find that noise-aware decoding increases the error suppression factor of the code, yielding reductions in the logical error rate that increase exponentially with the code distance. Our results indicate that noise characterisation experiments performed and processed in seconds will suffice to calibrate decoders for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers. This establishes the practicality and utility of noise-aware decoding for quantum error correction at scale.</description>

      <title>Quantum-aware Transformer model for state classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, playing a crucial role in quantum information processing. However, classifying entangled states, particularly in the mixed-state regime, remains a challenging problem, especially as system dimensions increase. In this work, we focus on bipartite quantum states and present a data-driven approach to entanglement classification using transformer-based neural networks. Our dataset consists of a diverse set of bipartite states, including pure separable states, Werner entangled states, general entangled states, and maximally entangled states. We pretrain the transformer in an unsupervised fashion by masking elements of vectorized Hermitian matrix representations of quantum states, allowing the model to learn structural properties of quantum density matrices. This approach enables the model to generalize entanglement characteristics across different classes of states. Once trained, our method achieves near-perfect classification accuracy, effectively distinguishing between separable and entangled states. Compared to previous Machine Learning, our method successfully adapts transformers for quantum state analysis, demonstrating their ability to systematically identify entanglement in bipartite systems. These results highlight the potential of modern machine learning techniques in automating entanglement detection and classification, bridging the gap between quantum information theory and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method with quantum selected configuration interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose using the wave function generated by the quantum selected configuration interaction (QSCI) method as the trial wave function in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC). In the QSCI framework, electronic configurations are sampled from the quantum state realized on a quantum computer. These configurations serve as basis states for constructing an effective Hamiltonian, which is then diagonalized to obtain the corresponding eigenstate. Using this wave function, ph-AFQMC is performed to recover the dynamical electron correlation across the whole orbital space. The use of the QSCI trial wave function is expected to improve the feasibility of the quantum-classical (QC) hybrid quantum Monte Carlo approach [Nature, 603, 416 (2022)]. We call this integrated approach QC-QSCI-AFQMC, or QSCI-AFQMC for short. This method is validated across several molecular systems. For H2O and a linear H4 chain, we achieved chemical accuracy in most investigations relative to full configuration interaction while utilizing superconducting quantum computers at Osaka University and RIKEN. Additionally, the application of QSCI-AFQMC to the O-H bond dissociation in an organic molecule highlights the complementary synergy between capturing static correlation on quantum hardware and incorporating dynamical correlation via classical post-processing. For the N2, when QSCI-AFQMC is executed with a noiseless simulator, it ranks among the most accurate methods compared to various multireference electronic structure theories. Although the proposed method is demonstrated using small active spaces on current quantum devices, the concept is not limited to few-qubit problems. The QSCI-AFQMC can compete with state-of-the-art classical computational techniques, particularly in larger active spaces, displaying considerable potential for resolving classically intractable problems in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum synchronization has been a subject of intensive research in the last decade. In this work, we propose a quantum Li\'enard system whose classical equivalent features two limit cycles to one of which the system will converge. In the quantum case, both limit cycles coexist in a single steady state. Each of these limit cycles localizes to a distinct phase if coupled to an external drive: one quantum state can thus be assigned two phases. Furthermore, coupling two such oscillators leads to the simultaneous appearance of synchronization and a synchronization blockade. To shed light on this apparent paradoxical result, we introduce finer measures of quantum synchronization.</description>

Abstract: The one-dimensional harmonic vibronic model, which is a generalization of the so-called linear Landau-Zener model and appears in the form of coupled Schr\"{o}dinger equations, is revisited. After decoupling the components, the resulting fourth-order equation is shown to have a hidden $sl(2)$ algebra. The so-called exceptional part of the spectrum is then expressed in a rather simple way. For completeness, the eigenfunctions are obtained via the Bethe ansatz approach directly in position space.</description>

      <title>BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigation of quantum errors is critical for current NISQ devices. In the current work, we address this task by treating the execution of quantum algorithms as the time evolution of an idealized physical system. We use knowledge of its physics to assist the mitigation of the quantum noise produced on the real device. In particular, the time evolution of the idealized system obeys a corresponding BBGKY hierarchy of equations. This is the basis for the novel error mitigation scheme that we propose. Specifically, we employ a subset of the BBGKY hierarchy as supplementary constraints in the ZNE method for error mitigation. We ensure that the computational cost of the scheme scales polynomially with the system size. We test our method on digital quantum simulations of the lattice Schwinger model under noise levels mimicking realistic quantum hardware. We demonstrate that our scheme systematically improves the error mitigation for the measurements of the particle number and the charge within this system. Relative to ZNE we obtain an average reduction of the error by 18.2% and 52.8% for the respective above observables. We propose further applications of the BBGKY hierarchy for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides a theoretically secure method for cryptographic key exchange by leveraging quantum mechanics, but practical implementations face vulnerabilities such as Trojan horse attack on phase modulators. This work analyzes the security of QKD systems under such attacks, considering both ideal and imperfect state preparation scenarios. The Trojan attack model is generalized to arbitrary states of probing pulses and conservative bounds of information leakage through side-channel of special form are introduced. The quantum coin imbalance, a critical security parameter, remains low (on the order of $10^{-7}$ for ideal state preparation and $10^{-5}$ for imperfect preparation) with this new approach and presence additional hardware passive countermeasures. Numerical simulations confirm nonzero secure key rate at distances over 100 km through optical fiber channel.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic Dynamics (ED) provides a framework that allows the reconstruction of the quantum formalism by insisting on ontological and epistemic clarity and adopting entropic methods and information geometry. Our present goal is to extend the ED framework to account for spin. The result is a realist {\psi}-epistemic model in which the ontology consists of a particle described by a definite position plus a discrete variable that describes Pauli's peculiar two-valuedness. The resulting dynamics of probabilities is, as might be expected, described by the Pauli equation. What may be unexpected is that the generators of transformations -- Hamiltonians and angular momenta including spin, are all granted clear epistemic status. To the old question `what is spinning?' ED provides a crisp answer: nothing is spinning.</description>

Abstract: A discrete time quantum walk is known to be the single-particle sector of a quantum cellular automaton. For a long time, these models have interested the community for their nice properties such as locality or translation invariance. This work introduces a model of distributed computation for arbitrary graphs inspired by quantum cellular automata. As a by-product, we show how this model can reproduce the dynamic of a quantum walk on graphs. In this context, we investigate the communication cost for two interaction schemes. Finally, we explain how this particular quantum walk can be applied to solve the search problem and present numerical results on different types of topologies.</description>

      <title>The iSWAP gate with polar molecules: Robustness criteria for entangling operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold polar molecules trapped in optical lattices or tweezer arrays are an emerging platform for quantum information processing and quantum simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental breakthroughs have enabled precise control over individual molecules, paving the way for implementing two-qubit quantum gates, based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is however the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength - stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials - that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasi-static deviations of either system Hamiltonian parameters, external control parameters, or both, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction using reasonable experimental parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only.</description>

Abstract: We present Learning-Driven Annealing (LDA), a framework that links individual quantum annealing evolutions into a global solution strategy to mitigate hardware constraints such as short annealing times and integrated control errors. Unlike other iterative methods, LDA does not tune the annealing procedure (e.g. annealing time or annealing schedule), but instead learns about the problem structure to adaptively modify the problem Hamiltonian. By deforming the instantaneous energy spectrum, LDA suppresses transitions into high-energy states and focuses the evolution into low-energy regions of the Hilbert space. We demonstrate the efficacy of LDA by developing a hybrid quantum-classical solver for large-scale spin glasses. The hybrid solver is based on a comprehensive study of the internal structure of spin glasses, outperforming other quantum and classical algorithms (e.g., reverse annealing, cyclic annealing, simulated annealing, Gurobi, Toshiba's SBM, VeloxQ and D-Wave hybrid) on 5580-qubit problem instances in both runtime and lowest energy. LDA is a step towards practical quantum computation that enables today's quantum devices to compete with classical solvers.</description>

      <title>Quantum arrival times in free fall</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability distribution of a time measurement $T_x$ at position $x$ can be inferred from the probability distribution of a position measurement $X_t$ at time $t$ as given by the Born rule [Time-of-arrival distributions for continuous quantum systems and application to quantum backflow, Phys. Rev. A 110, 052217 (2024)]. In an application to free-fall, this finding has been used to predict the existence of a mass-dependent positive relative shift with respect to the classical time-of-arrival in the long time-of-flight regime for dropped quantum particles [M. Beau and L. Martellini, Quantum delay in the time of arrival of free-falling atoms, Phys. Rev. A 109, 012216 (2024).]. The present paper extends these results in two important directions. We first show that for a Gaussian quantum particle of mass $m$ dropped in a uniform gravitational field $g$, the uncertainties about time and position measurements are related by the relation $ \Delta T_x \Delta X_t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2mg} . $ This novel form of uncertainty relation suggests that choosing the initial state so as to obtain a lower uncertainty in the measured position leads to a higher uncertainty in the measured arrival time. Secondly, we examine the case of a free-falling particle starting from a non-Gaussian initial superposed state, for which we predict the presence of gravitationally induced interferences and oscillations in the mean time-of-arrival as a function of the detector's position that can be interpreted as the signature of a Zitterbewegung-like effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated both by classical physics problems associated with ``Newton's bucket'' and recent developments related to QCD in rotating frames of reference relevant to heavy ion collisions, we discuss the difference between ``active'' and ``passive'' rotations in quantum systems. We examine some relevant potentials and give general symmetry arguments to give criteria where such rotations give the same results. We close with a discussion of how this can be translated to quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Robustness of Partitioned Quantum Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness in quantum classifiers is a critical area of study, providing insights into their performance compared to classical models and uncovering potential advantages inherent to quantum machine learning. In the NISQ era of quantum computing, circuit cutting is a notable technique for simulating circuits that exceed the qubit limitations of current devices, enabling the distribution of a quantum circuit's execution across multiple quantum processing units through classical communication. We examine how partitioning quantum classifiers through circuit cutting increase their susceptibility to adversarial attacks, establishing a link between attacking the state preparation channels in wire cutting and implementing adversarial gates within intermediate layers of a quantum classifier. We then proceed to study the latter problem from both a theoretical and experimental perspective.</description>

      <title>Efimov Effect in Long-range Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When two non-relativistic particles interact resonantly in three dimensions, an infinite tower of three-body bound states emerges, exhibiting a discrete scale invariance. This universal phenomenon, known as the Efimov effect, has garnered extensive attention across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics. In this letter, we demonstrate that the Efimov effect also manifests in long-range quantum spin chains. The long-range coupling modifies the low-energy dispersion of magnons, enabling the emergence of continuous scale invariance for two-magnon states at resonance. This invariance is subsequently broken to discrete scale invariance upon imposing short-range boundary conditions for the three-magnon problem, leading to the celebrated Efimov bound states. Using effective field theory, we theoretically determine how the ratio of two successive binding energies depends on the interaction range, which agrees with the numerical solution of the bound-state problem. We further discuss generalizations to arbitrary spatial dimensions, where the traditional Efimov effect serves as a special case. Our results reveal universal physics in dilute quantum gases of magnons that can be experimentally tested in trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement between accelerated probes in de Sitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate an investigation into features of vacuum entanglement as probed by accelerated quantum probes in curved spacetime. Focussing specifically on de Sitter (dS) spacetime with curvature $\Lambda$, we obtain several exact results corresponding to different kinematical set-up of the probes. The interaction with the quantum field creates a non-local correlation between initially uncorrelated probes accelerating in different directions. It is well known that a single quantum probe in dS spacetime with uniform acceleration $a$ responds exactly as a quantum probe in Minkowski spacetime with "effective" acceleration $q \equiv\sqrt{a^2+\Lambda}$. However, no such mapping generically exists for the entanglement between probes. Our results suggest that entanglement exhibits independent variations with changes in acceleration and curvature depending on different configurations of detector motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kittel--Shore (KS) Hamiltonian describes $N$ spins with long-range interactions that are identically coupled. In this paper, the underlying $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ coalgebra symmetry of the KS model is demonstrated for arbitrary spins, and the quantum deformation of the KS Hamiltonian ($q$-KS model) is obtained using the corresponding $\mathfrak{su}_q(2)$ quantum group. By construction, the existence of such a symmetry guarantees that all integrability properties of the KS model are preserved under $q$-deformation. In particular, the $q$-KS model for spin-$1/2$ particles is analysed in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, and the cases with $N=2,3,$ and $4$ spins are studied in detail. The higher-spin $q$-KS models are sketched.</description>

      <title>Bound-state formation and thermalization within the Lindblad approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation, as one approach to open quantum systems, describes the density matrix of a particle or a chain of interacting particles, which are in contact with a thermal bath. Still, it is not fully understood yet, how arbitrary systems evolve towards a stationary distribution, which guarantees thermalization in a thermodynamical context, and how to systematically incorporate the variety of assumptions that are made in this approach in order to preserve thermal Gibbs states. Despite these shortcomings, Lindblad dynamics was successfully employed in heavy-ion physics (quarkonia) and also became of interest in quantum-computer applications.
  In this paper, we consider a problem borrowed from heavy-ion collisions, namely the formation of bound states, as for example the deuteron, in the non-relativistic regime by using the already well understood techniques of Lindblad dynamics. However, only recently, we were able to extend this toolbox by showing, that the position-space Lindblad equation can be reformulated in terms of a diffusion-advection equation with sources and therefore provides a hydrodynamical formulation of a dissipative quantum master equation. Making use of this advanced machinery and insights, we describe the possible formation of a bound state, which is realized by a P\"oschl-Teller-like potential, of a particle in interaction with a heat bath in a 1-dim setting. We analyse the possibility of a thermalization and the time-scale of the formation, population and depopulation of the bound state. Finally, we also show an example of a much deeper potential, where we allow for three bound states, just in the spirit of quarkonia. Besides this, we discuss general aspects of open quantum systems, like decoherence, entropy production etc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The OmpSs-2 programming model is used in HPC programs to parallelize code and offload code to accelerators. In this work, we extend the offloading capability to quantum computers. We explain the necessary changes to the Clang compiler and the Nanos6 runtime, which are both part of OmpSs-2. In addition, we develop a simulator that simulates a quantum computer in the network and receives the jobs offloaded by the runtime. Four detailed examples show how our programming model can be used to write hybrid quantum-classical software. The examples are random number generation, a parameter scan using the mean-field ansatz, a variational algorithm using this ansatz, and handwritten digit recognition using a hybrid convolutional neural network.</description>

      <title>All-dry pick-up and transfer method for quantum emitter arrays in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photon emitters in hexagonal boron nitride are based on fluorescent point-like defects. These defects typically have exceptional photophysical properties and therefore been the focus of extensive research due to their potential to advance photonic quantum technologies. However, achieving scalable integration of these emitters to arbitrary platforms with high yield while retaining their characteristics remains a significant challenge, particularly when the target substrate is not compatible with the fabrication method. In this work, we introduce an all-dry transfer method aimed at addressing these challenges with improved effectiveness compared to existing techniques. This polymer stamp-assisted transfer method maintains high output and preserves the fundamental characteristics of the emitters while eliminating wet chemical processes. A comprehensive post-transfer characterization verified not only the maintenance of the defining characteristic of a single photon emitter, the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, but also showed improvement by about 46%. In contrast, the lifetime, emission spectrum, and the photostability showed only negligible change, demonstrating that the characteristics of the emitters were retained during the transfer process. This transfer technique has success rate of 81.8%, determined by the proportion of single photon emitters that retain their optical and preserve physical structure post-transfer. This high success rate shows the potential to scale the integration of single photon emitters across diverse platforms. We expect that this process contributes to the applications of boron nitride defects in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Raman Signatures of Single Point Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects in solid-state quantum systems are vital for enabling single-photon emission at specific wavelengths, making their precise identification essential for advancing applications in quantum technologies. However, pinpointing the microscopic origins of these defects remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Raman spectroscopy as a robust strategy for defect identification. Using density functional theory, we systematically characterize the Raman signatures of 100 defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) spanning periodic groups III to VI, encompassing around 30,000 phonon modes. Our findings reveal that the local atomic environment plays a pivotal role in shaping the Raman lineshape, enabling the narrowing of potential defect candidates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy can differentiate defects based on their spin and charge states as well as strain-induced variations, implying the versatility of this approach. Therefore, this study not only provides a comprehensive theoretical database of Raman spectra for hBN defects but also establishes a novel experiment framework for using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy to identify point defects. More broadly, our approach offers a universal method for defect identification in any quantum materials.</description>

      <title>QFAL: Quantum Federated Adversarial Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) merges the privacy advantages of federated systems with the computational potential of quantum neural networks (QNNs), yet its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains poorly understood. This work pioneers the integration of adversarial training into QFL, proposing a robust framework, quantum federated adversarial learning (QFAL), where clients collaboratively defend against perturbations by combining local adversarial example generation with federated averaging (FedAvg). We systematically evaluate the interplay between three critical factors: client count (5, 10, 15), adversarial training coverage (0-100%), and adversarial attack perturbation strength (epsilon = 0.01-0.5), using the MNIST dataset. Our experimental results show that while fewer clients often yield higher clean-data accuracy, larger federations can more effectively balance accuracy and robustness when partially adversarially trained. Notably, even limited adversarial coverage (e.g., 20%-50%) can significantly improve resilience to moderate perturbations, though at the cost of reduced baseline performance. Conversely, full adversarial training (100%) may regain high clean accuracy but is vulnerable under stronger attacks. These findings underscore an inherent trade-off between robust and standard objectives, which is further complicated by quantum-specific factors. We conclude that a carefully chosen combination of client count and adversarial coverage is critical for mitigating adversarial vulnerabilities in QFL. Moreover, we highlight opportunities for future research, including adaptive adversarial training schedules, more diverse quantum encoding schemes, and personalized defense strategies to further enhance the robustness-accuracy trade-off in real-world quantum federated environments.</description>

Abstract: We summarize basic features of quantum gravity states and processes, common to a number of related quantum gravity formalisms, and sharing a purely combinatorial and algebraic language, and a discrete geometric interpretation. We emphasize how, in this context, entanglement is a seed of topological and geometric properties, and how a pre-geometric, discrete notion of quantum causality can be implemented, as well as some recent results (based on random tensor network techniques) on the conditions for information transmission and holographic behaviour in quantum gravity states. Together, these features indicate that quantum information concepts and tools play a key role in defining the fundamental structure of quantum spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To go beyond quantum optics in free-space setups, atom-light interfaces with structured photonic environments are often employed to realize unconventional quantum electrodynamics (QED) phenomena. However, when employed as quantum buses, those long-distance nanostructures are limited by fabrication disorders. In this work, we alternatively propose to realize structured lightmatter interactions by engineering multiple coupling points of hybrid giant atom-conventionalenvironments without any periodic structure. We present a generic optimization method to obtain the real-space coupling sequence for multiple coupling points. We report a broadband chiral emission in a very wide frequency regime, with no analog in other quantum setups. Moreover, we show that the QED phenomena in the band gap environment, such as fractional atomic decay and dipole-dipole interactions mediated by a bound state, can be observed in our setup. Numerical results indicate that our proposal is robust against fabrication disorders of the coupling sequence. Our work opens up a new route for realizing unconventional light-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17837v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effectively compressing and optimizing tensor networks requires reliable methods for fixing the latent degrees of freedom of the tensors, known as the gauge. Here we introduce a new algorithm for gauging tensor networks using belief propagation, a method that was originally formulated for performing statistical inference on graphical models and has recently found applications in tensor network algorithms. We show that this method is closely related to known tensor network gauging methods. It has the practical advantage, however, that existing belief propagation implementations can be repurposed for tensor network gauging, and that belief propagation is a very simple algorithm based on just tensor contractions so it can be easier to implement, optimize, and generalize. We present numerical evidence and scaling arguments that this algorithm is faster than existing gauging algorithms, demonstrating its usage on structured, unstructured, and infinite tensor networks. Additionally, we apply this method to improve the accuracy of the widely used simple update gate evolution algorithm.</description>

      <title>A proof that no-signalling implies microcausality in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study some logical interrelationships between fundamental properties in (relativistic) quantum theories. An operational no-signalling condition is first introduced in the context of quantum mechanics, where we prove its equivalence to an apparently weaker version restricted to ideal measurements, and to a property of factorization of the evolution unitary operator. We then translate this condition in quantum field theory and prove that it implies both microcausality and the spin-statistics theorem, in the ideal case of pointwise measurements implemented in the projection postulate sense. This provides an argument (often invoked but apparently missing in the literature) to see microcausality as a necessary condition for the compatibility of spacelike separated operations.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage in a unified scenario and secure detection of resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resources may provide advantage over their classical counterparts. We say this as quantum advantage. Here we consider a single communication task to study different approaches of observing quantum advantage. We say this setting as a unified scenario. In our task, there are three parties - the Manager, Alice, and Bob. The Manager sends a value of a random variable to Alice and at the same time Bob receives some partial information regarding that value. Initially, neither Alice nor Bob knows the input of the other, received from the Manager. The goal of the task is achieved if and only if the value of the random variable, sent to Alice by the Manager, is identified by Bob with success probability greater than half all the time. Here non-zero error probability is allowed. However, to help Bob, Alice sends a limited amount of classical or quantum information to him (cbit or qubit). We show that the goal of the task can be achieved when Alice sends a qubit. On the other hand, a cbit communication is not sufficient for achieving the goal. Thus, it establishes quantum advantage. We further show that the optimal success probability in the overall process for a qubit communication can be higher than the optimal success probability for a cbit communication. In fact, this success probability is higher for qubit communication even if along with cbit communication Alice and Bob share randomness. Clearly, it demonstrates a more prominent non-classical feature. Actually, we obtain higher success probability compared to other tasks. This also suggests the experiment friendly nature of our task. We then connect our task with semi-device-independence and show how our task can be useful to detect quantumness of a communication in a secure way. With increasing dimension of the random variable, to achieve the goal, the separation between the quantum and the classical communication also increases.</description>

      <title>Temperature as Joules per Bit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical mechanics, entropy is defined as a fundamental quantity. However, its unit, J/K, involves that of temperature, which is only subsequently defined - and defined in terms of entropy. This circularity arises with the introduction of Boltzmann's constant into the very expression of entropy. The J/K carried by the constant prevents entropy from finding a unit of its own while simultaneously obfuscating its informational nature. Following the precepts of information theory, we argue that entropy is well measured in bits and coincides with information capacity at thermodynamic equilibrium. Consequently, not only is the temperature of a system in equilibrium expressed in J/bit, but it acquires a clear meaning: It is the cost in energy to increase its information capacity by 1 bit. Viewing temperature as joules per bit uncovers the strong duality exhibited by Gibbs long ago between available capacity and free energy. It also simplifies Landauer's cost and clarifies that it is a cost of displacement, not of erasure. Replacing the kelvin with the bit as an SI unit would remove Boltzmann's constant from the seven defining constants.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport through a single trapped ion under strong laser illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum heat transport in a single trapped ion, driven by laser excitation and coupled to thermal reservoirs operating at different temperatures. Our focus lies in understanding how different laser coupling scenarios impact the system dynamics. As the laser intensity reaches a regime where the ion's electronic and motional degrees of freedom strongly couple, traditional approaches using phenomenological models for thermal reservoirs become inadequate. Therefore, the adoption of the dressed master equation (DME) formalism becomes crucial, enabling a deeper understanding of how distinct laser intensities influence heat transport. Analyzing the heat current within the parameter space defined by detuning and coupling strength, we observe intriguing circular patterns which are influenced by the ion's vibrational frequency and laser parameters, and reveal nuanced relationships between heat transport, residual coherence, and system characteristics. Our study also reveals phenomena such as negative differential heat conductivity and asymmetry in heat current flow, offering insights into the thermal properties of this essential quantum technology setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06962v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Hong--Ou--Mandel effect illustrates the richness of two-photon interferometry. In this work, we demonstrate that this extends to the realm of time-frequency interferometry. Taking advantage of the mathematical analogy which can be drawn between the frequency and quadrature degrees of freedom of light when there is a single photon in each auxiliary mode, we consider the equivalent of the Hong--Ou--Mandel effect in the frequency domain. In this setting, the $n$-Fock state becomes equivalent to a single-photon state with a spectral wave function given by the $n^{th}$ Hermite--Gauss function and destructive interference corresponds to vanishing probability of detecting single photons with an order one Hermite--Gauss spectral profile. This compelling analogy motivates us to propose an interferometric strategy that uses a frequency-engineered two-photon state to achieve enhanced phase precision that scales inversely with the number of modes. Finally, we generalise the Gaussian Boson Sampling model to time-frequency degrees of freedom of single photons.</description>

      <title>Long-fiber Sagnac interferometers for twin field quantum key distribution networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Sagnac loop structure can help overcome the major difficulty in the practical implementation of a twin field quantum key distribution (TFQKD) network, namely, the need to stabilize the phase of a quantum state over many kilometers of fiber. Unfortunately, Rayleigh backscattering noise limits the signal-to-noise ratio for Sagnac systems containing long fibers and lossy photonic devices. Here, we solve this problem by sending optical pulses in long on-off bursts and using time post-selection on measurements taken with free-run single-photon avalanche detectors. We also investigate the impact of the residual phase noise uncompensated by the Sagnac structure and find that the variance of the phase noise scales as loop length to the third power, verifying an existing calculation in the literature. We measure the interference visibility in Sagnac loops of varying length without active phase stabilization and achieve &gt; 97% visibility in 200 km ultra-low-loss fiber, which is, to our knowledge, the longest fiber Sagnac interferometer demonstrated. Our results suggest that a Sagnac system is feasible for long-distance TFQKD networks, an important step towards the practical implementation of metropolitan quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Drug discovery and development is a highly complex and costly endeavor, typically requiring over a decade and substantial financial investment to bring a new drug to market. Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made significant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of quantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper discusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and development, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance various stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the application of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug discovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target interactions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By leveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to reduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market, ultimately benefiting public health.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) is a low-complexity learning paradigm that combines the inherent dynamics of input-driven many-body quantum systems with classical learning techniques for nonlinear temporal data processing. Optimizing the QRC process and computing device is a complex task due to the dependence of many-body quantum systems to various factors. To explore this, we introduce a strongly interacting spin model on random regular graphs as the quantum component and investigate the interplay between static disorder, interactions, and graph connectivity, revealing their critical impact on quantum memory capacity and learnability accuracy. We tackle linear quantum and nonlinear classical tasks, and identify optimal learning and memory regimes through studying information localization, dynamical quantum correlations, and the many-body structure of the disordered Hamiltonian. In particular, we uncover the role of previously overlooked network connectivity and demonstrate how the presence of quantum correlations can significantly enhance the learning performance. Our findings thus provide guidelines for the optimal design of disordered analog quantum learning platforms.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy in the effect of chaos on ergotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximum unitarily extractable work from a quantum system -- ergotropy -- is the basic principle behind quantum batteries, a rapidly emerging field. This work studies ergotropy in two quantum chaotic systems, the quantum kicked top and the kicked Ising spin chain, to illustrate the effects of chaotic dynamics. In an ancilla-assisted scenario, chaos enhances ergotropy when the state is known, a consequence of large entanglement production in the chaotic regime. When the state is unknown, we need to at least partially characterize the state using coarse-grained measurements for useful extraction of work. In this case, chaos impedes ergotropy by suppressing information gained from coarse-grained measurements, while entanglement with an ancilla still facilitates ergotropy. In this scenario, we study the interplay between chaos and entanglement and find a sweet spot in the chaos parameter for optimal work. Our results point to the potential of quantum chaos-assisted batteries for better work extraction.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is a vital phenomenon required for realizing secure quantum networks, so much that distributed entanglement can be re-imagined as a commodity which can be traded to enable and maintain these networks. We explore the idea of commercializing entanglement-based cryptography and future applications where advanced quantum memory systems support less advanced users. We design a sneakernet-based quantum communication network with a central party connecting the users through delayed-choice quantum entanglement swapping, using quantum Low-Density-Parity-Check (qLDPC) encoded qubits on neutral atoms. Our analysis compares this approach with traditional surface codes, demonstrating that qLDPC codes offer superior scaling in terms of resource efficiency and logical qubit count. We show that with near-term attainable patch sizes, one can attain medium-to-high fidelity correlations, paving the way towards large-scale commercial quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Clifford Strategies in Interactive Protocols are Classically Simulatable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complexity class $\text{MIP}^\ast$ consists of all languages decidable by an efficient classical verifier interacting with multiple entanglement-sharing and non-communicating quantum provers. Notably, $\text{MIP}^\ast$ was proved to equal $\text{RE}$, the class of all recursively enumerable languages.
  We introduce the complexity class $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$, which restricts quantum provers to Clifford operations and classical post-processing of measurement results. We show that strategies in this model can be simulated by classical randomness-sharing provers. In other words, Clifford operations alone do not suffice to generate non-classical correlations in interactive protocols. Consequently, $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast = \text{MIP}$, a vastly smaller complexity class compared to $\text{RE}$.
  Moreover, we resolve an open question posed by Kalai et al. (STOC 2023), by showing that quantum advantage in any single-round non-local game requires at least two provers operating outside the $\text{Clifford-MIP}^\ast$ computational model. This rules out a proposed approach for significantly improving the efficiency of tests for quantum advantage that are based on compiling non-local games into single-prover interactive protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a methodology for implementing Grover's algorithm in the digital quantum simulation of disordered Ising models. The core concept revolves around using the evolution operator for the Ising model as the quantum oracle within Grover's search. This operator induces phase shifts for the eigenstates of the Ising Hamiltonian, with the most pronounced shifts occurring for the lowest and highest energy states. Determining these states for a disordered Ising Hamiltonian using classical methods presents an exponentially complex challenge with respect to the number of spins (or qubits) involved. Within our proposed approach, we determine the optimal evolution time by ensuring a phase flip for the target states. This method yields a quadratic speedup compared to classical computation methods and enables the identification of the lowest and highest energy states (or neighboring states) with a high probability $\lesssim 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional circuit-based quantum computing architectures, the standard gate set includes arbitrary single-qubit rotations and two-qubit entangling gates. This choice is not always aligned with the native operations available in certain hardware, where the natural entangling gates are not restricted to two qubits but can act on multiple, or even all, qubits simultaneously. However, leveraging the capabilities of global quantum operations for algorithm implementations is highly challenging, as directly compiling local gate sequences into global gates usually gives rise to a quantum circuit that is more complex than the original one. Here, we circumvent this difficulty using a variational approach. Specifically, we study parameterized circuit ansatze composed of a finite number of global gates and layers of single-qubit unitaries. We demonstrate the expressibility of these ansatze and apply them to the problem of ground state preparation for the Heisenberg model and the toric code Hamiltonian, highlighting their potential for offering practical advantages.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dissipative cat qubit protection by squeezing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative cat-qubits are a promising architecture for quantum processors due to their built-in quantum error correction. By leveraging two-photon stabilization, they achieve an exponentially suppressed bit-flip error rate as the distance in phase-space between their basis states increases, incurring only a linear increase in phase-flip rate. This property substantially reduces the number of qubits required for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here, we implement a squeezing deformation of the cat qubit basis states, further extending the bit-flip time while minimally affecting the phase-flip rate. We demonstrate a steep reduction in the bit-flip error rate with increasing mean photon number, characterized by a scaling exponent $\gamma=4.3$, rising by a factor of 74 per added photon. Specifically, we measure bit-flip times of 22 seconds for a phase-flip time of 1.3 $\mu$s in a squeezed cat qubit with an average photon number $\bar{n}=4.1$, a 160-fold improvement in bit-flip time compared to a standard cat. Moreover, we demonstrate a two-fold reduction in $Z$-gate infidelity, with an estimated phase-flip probability of $\epsilon_X = 0.085$ and a bit-flip probability of $\epsilon_Z = 2.65 \cdot 10^{-9}$ which confirms the gate bias-preserving property. This simple yet effective technique enhances cat qubit performances without requiring design modification, moving multi-cat architectures closer to fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classical NP-hard problem that plays a crucial role in combinatorial optimization. In this paper, we are interested in the quantum search framework for the TSP because it has robust theoretical guarantees. However, we need to first search for all Hamiltonian cycles from a very large solution space, which greatly weakens the advantage of quantum search algorithms. To address this issue, one can first prepare a superposition state of all feasible solutions, and then amplify the amplitude of the optimal solution from it. We propose a quantum algorithm to generate the uniform superposition state of all N-length Hamiltonian cycles as an initial state within polynomial gate complexity based on pure quantum dynamic programming with very few ancillary qubits, which achieves exponential acceleration compared to the previous initial state preparation algorithm. As a result, we realized the theoretical minimum query complexity of quantum search algorithms for a general TSP. Compared to some algorithms that theoretically have lower query complexities but lack practical implementation solutions, our algorithm has feasible circuit implementation. Our work provides a meaningful research case on how to fully utilize the structures of specific problems to unleash the acceleration capability of the quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>The Jaynes Cummings model as an autonomous Maxwell demon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the Jaynes-Cummings model as an autonomous thermodynamic machine, where a qubit is driven by a cavity containing initially a large coherent field. Our analysis reveals a transition between the expected behavior of ideal-work source of the cavity at short times, and a long-time dynamics where the cavity autonomously measures the qubit and exerts a result-dependent drive. This autonomous feedback then purifies the qubit irrespective of its initial state. We show that the cavity functions thermodynamically as an autonomous Maxwell demon, trading mutual information for cooling power.</description>

      <title>PT -symmetry breaking and universal spectral statistics in quantum kicked rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous parity-time (PT )-symmetry breaking and spectral properties of a PT symmetric quantum kicked rotor under resonance conditions. At resonance, the QKR reduces to a finite-dimensional system. In the localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter always induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry to one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the delocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the reduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT symmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter. We further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized regime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions from Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, to Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the intermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution. For complex spectra, the level-spacing ratios and distributions are governed by time-reversal symmetry. The spectral statistics align with predictions for non-Hermitian random matrix ensembles in classes AI{\dag} and A, depending on the presence or absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results provide insights into the spectral characteristics of non-Hermitian quantum chaotic systems and their connection to PT symmetry.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and complex-time correlations using minimally entangled typical thermal states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states have enjoyed great success at capturing aspects of strong correlation physics. However, obtaining dynamical correlators at non-zero temperatures is generically hard even using these methods. Here, we introduce a practical approach to computing such correlators using minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS). While our primary method directly computes dynamical correlators of physical operators in real time, we propose extensions where correlations are evaluated in the complex-time plane. The imaginary time component bounds the rate of entanglement growth and strongly alleviates the computational difficulty allowing the study of larger system sizes. To extract the physical correlator one must take the limit of purely real-time evolution. We present two routes to obtaining this information (i) via an analytic correlation function in complex time combined with a stochastic analytic continuation method to obtain the real-time limit and (ii) a hermitian correlation function that asymptotically captures the desired correlation function quantitatively without requiring effort of numerical analytic continuation. We show that these numerical techniques capture the finite-temperature dynamics of the Shastry-Sutherland model - a model of interacting spin one-half in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Spin self-organization in an optical cavity facilitated by inhomogeneous broadening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the onset of collective spin-self-organization in a thermal ensemble of driven two-level atoms confined in an optical cavity. The atoms spontaneously form a spin-pattern above a critical driving strength that sets a threshold and is determined by the cavity parameters, the initial temperature, and the transition frequency of the atomic spin. Remarkably, we find that inhomogeneous Doppler broadening facilitates the onset of spin-self-organization. In particular, the threshold is non-monotonic when increasing the spin transition frequency and reaches a minimum when the Doppler broadening is of similar magnitude. This feature emerges due to Doppler-induced resonances. Above the threshold, we find cooperative dynamics of spin, spatial, and momentum degrees of freedom leading to density modulations, fast reduction of kinetic energy, and the emergence of non-thermal states. More broadly, our work demonstrates how broadening can facilitate strong light-matter interactions in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>How a Space-Time Singularity Helps Remove the Ultraviolet Divergence Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle creation terms in quantum Hamiltonians are usually ultraviolet divergent and thus mathematically ill defined. A rather novel way of solving this problem is based on imposing so-called interior-boundary conditions on the wave function. Previous papers showed that this approach works in the non-relativistic regime, but particle creation is mostly relevant in the relativistic case after all. In flat relativistic space-time (that is, neglecting gravity), the approach was previously found to work only for certain somewhat artificial cases. Here, as a way of taking gravity into account, we consider curved space-time, specifically the super-critical Reissner-Nordstr\"om space-time, which features a naked timelike singularity. We find that the interior-boundary approach works fully in this setting; in particular, we prove rigorously the existence of well-defined, self-adjoint Hamiltonians with particle creation at the singularity, based on interior-boundary conditions. We also non-rigorously analyze the asymptotic behavior of the Bohmian trajectories and construct the corresponding Bohm-Bell process of particle creation, motion, and annihilation. The upshot is that in quantum physics, a naked space-time singularity need not lead to a breakdown of physical laws, but on the contrary allows for boundary conditions governing what comes out of the singularity and thereby removing the ultraviolet divergence.</description>

      <title>Energy-filtered excited states and real-time dynamics served in a contour integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is observed that the Cauchy integral formula (CIF) can be used to represent holomorphic functions of diagonalizable operators on a finite domain. This forms the theoretical foundation for applying various operators in the form of a contour integral to a state, while filtering away eigen-components that are not included by the contour. As a special case, the identity operator in the integral form--the Riesz projector--is used to design an algorithm for finding a given number of eigen-pairs whose energies are close to a specified value in the equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) framework, with applications to calculate core excited states of molecules which is relevant for the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). As a generalization, I showcase a novel real-time electron dynamics (RT-EOM-CCSD) algorithm based on the CIF form of the exponential time-evolution operator, which admits extremely large time steps while preserving accurate spectral information.</description>

      <title>A Strategy for Proving the Strong Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis : Chaotic Systems and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09746v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a sufficient condition for thermalization and equilibration. Although it is expected to be hold in a wide class of highly chaotic theories, there are only a few analytic examples demonstrating the strong ETH in special cases, often through methods related to integrability. In this paper, we explore sufficient conditions for the strong ETH that may apply to a broad range of chaotic theories. These conditions are expressed as inequalities involving the long-time averages of real-time thermal correlators. Specifically, as an illustration, we consider simple toy examples which satisfy these conditions under certain technical assumptions. This toy models have same properties as holographic theories at least in the perturbation in large $N$. We give a few comments for more realistic holographic models.</description>

      <title>Group Invariant Quantum Latin Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square is an $n \times n$ array of unit vectors where each row and column forms an orthonormal basis of a fixed complex vector space. We introduce the notion of $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin squares for finite groups $G$ and $G'$. These are quantum Latin squares with rows and columns indexed by $G$ and $G'$ respectively such that the inner product of the $a,b$-entry with the $c,d$-entry depends only on $a^{-1}c \in G$ and $b^{-1}d \in G'$. This definition is motivated by the notion of group invariant bijective correlations introduced in [Roberson \&amp; Schmidt (2020)], and every group invariant quantum Latin square produces a group invariant bijective correlation, though the converse does not hold. In this work we investigate these group invariant quantum Latin squares and their corresponding correlations. Our main result is that, up to applying a global isometry to every vector in a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square, there is a natural bijection between these objects and trace and conjugate transpose preserving isomorphisms between the group algebras of $G$ and $G'$. This in particular proves that a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square exists if and only if the multisets of degrees of irreducible representations are equal for $G$ and $G'$. Another motivation for this line of work is that whenever Cayley graphs for groups $G$ and $G'$ are quantum isomorphic, then there is a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum correlation witnessing this, and thus it suffices to consider such correlations when searching for quantum isomorphic Cayley graphs. Given a group invariant quantum correlation, we show how to construct all pairs of graphs for which it gives a quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise spectroscopy of superconducting dynamics in thin film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the low-energy dynamics of quantum materials is crucial to our understanding of strongly correlated electronic states. Yet, it remains experimentally challenging to investigate such dynamics with high spectroscopic resolution in both frequency and momentum space, particularly in two-dimensional correlated systems. Here, we leverage Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a powerful and non-invasive tool to study thin-film Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (BSCCO), revealing several distinct dynamical phenomena across the superconducting phase diagram. At zero magnetic field and low temperatures, NV depolarization ($T_1$) noise spectroscopy captures the low-frequency (GHz-scale) magnetic noise generated by nodal superconducting quasiparticle excitations, in agreement with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) mean-field theory. Near the critical temperature $T_c \approx 90$ K, supercurrent-fluctuation-induced noise leads to a sharp reduction of the NV $T_1$. By carefully analyzing the temperature-scaling of $T_1$, we observe clear deviations from the BCS prediction, reflecting the importance of order parameter fluctuations and enabling the determination of both static and dynamical critical exponents. When a small field is applied, we detect a broad and asymmetric reduction of NV $T_1$ near $T_c$; the field-induced smearing of the transition unveils the presence of a vortex liquid phase. Finally, NV decoherence ($T_2$) noise spectroscopy allows us to characterize magnetic noise at even lower MHz-scale frequencies and obtain evidence for complex vortex-solid fluctuations well below $T_c$. Our results establish quantum noise spectroscopy as a versatile platform for probing dynamical phenomena in superconductors, with frequency and length scales complementary to existing techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conducting levitated mechanical experiments in extreme conditions has long been the aim of researchers, as it allows for the investigation of new fundamental physics phenomena. One of the great frontiers has been sending these experiments into the micro-g environment of space, with multiple proposals calling for such a platform. At the same time, levitated sensors have demonstrated a high sensitivity to external stimuli which will only improve in low-vibrational conditions. conditions This paper describes the development of a technology demonstrator for optical and magnetic trapping experiments in space. Our payload represents the first concrete step towards future missions with aims of probing fundamental physical questions: matter-wave interferometry of nanoparticles to probe the limits of macroscopic quantum mechanics, detection of Dark Matter candidates and gravitational waves to test physics beyond the Standard Model, and accelerometry for Earth-observation.</description>
