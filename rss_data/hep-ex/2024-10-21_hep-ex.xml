      <title>Dark matter searches at BESIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) is a new type of invisible matter introduced to explain various features of recent astrophysical observations, including galaxy rotation curves and other fundamental characteristics of our universe. DM may couple to ordinary matter via portals, which open up possibilities for new particles, such as axion-like particle, light Higgs boson, dark photon, and spin-1/2 fermions. If the masses of these particles lie in the MeV to GeV range, they can be explored by high-intensity electron-positron collider experiments, such as the BESIII experiment. BESIII has accumulated a huge amount of datasets at several energy points, including the $J/\psi$, $\psi(3686)$, and $\psi(3770)$ resonances. BESIII has recently explored the possibility for axion-like particle and light Higgs boson through radiative $J/\psi$ decays, dark photon via the initial-state radiation process, and a massless dark photon in $\Lambda_c$ decays. This report highlights the latest results from the BESIII experiment on these topics.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics in WW and single-W events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pair-production and single-production of $W$ bosons provide many opportunities to look for new physics via precision measurements, for instance via scrutinising the involved triple-gauge vertices or by measuring CKM matrix elements in an environment very complementary to $B$ hadron decays. This contribution presents the ongoing work based on full simulation of the ILD concept, exploiting the O($10^8$) $W$ bosons produced during the $250$\,GeV stage of the ILC, as well as the CLD concept proposed for the FCC-ee. The projections, which also contribute to two focus topics of the current ECFA study on future Higgs/Top/Electroweak factories, promise improvements of the measurement precision of TGCs and the CKM matrix, respectively, of one to two orders of magnitude with respects to LEP.</description>

      <title>Towards an update of the ILD ZHH analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double Higgs-strahlungs process $e^+e^- \rightarrow ZHH$ allows to access the Higgs self-coupling at center-of-mass energies above $450$ GeV. Its cross-section exhibits a very different behavior as a function of the value of the self-coupling than fusion-type processes like gluon-gluon fusion at LHC (and future hadron colliders) and $WW$ / $ZZ$ fusion at higher energy lepton colliders. Therefore it adds unique information to the picture, in particular should the value of the Higgs self-coupling differ from its Standard Model prediction. The last full evaluation of the potential of the ILC to measure this process is more than ten years old, and since then many of the reconstruction tools have received very significant improvements. This contribution presents the ongoing work in the ILD collaboration to update the ZHH projections for the next European Particle Physics Strategy Update.</description>

      <title>Summary of Global Extraction of the $\rm^{12}C$ Nuclear Electromagnetic Response Functions and Comparisons to Nuclear Theory and Neutrino/Electron Monte Carlo Generators at Nufact24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a brief report (at the Nufact-2024 conference) summarizing a global extraction of the ${\rm ^{12}C}$ longitudinal (${\cal R}_L$) and transverse (${\cal R}_T$) nuclear electromagnetic response functions from an analysis of all available electron scattering data on carbon. Since the extracted response functions cover a large kinematic range they can be readily used for comparison to theoretical predictions as well as validation and tuning Monte Carlo (MC) generators for electron and neutrino scattering experiments. Comparisons to several theoretical approaches and MC generators are given in detail in arXiv:2409.10637v1 [hep-ex]. We find that among all the theoretical models that were investigated, the ``Energy Dependent-Relativistic Mean Field'' (ED-RMF) approach provides the best description of both the Quasielastic (QE) and {\it nuclear excitation} response functions (leading to single nucleon final states) over all values of four-momentum transfer. The QE data are also well described by the "Short Time Approximation Quantum Monte Carlo" (STA-QMC) calculation which includes both single and two nucleon final states which presently is only valid for momentum transfer $\bf q &gt; $ 0.3 GeV and does not include nuclear excitations. However, an analytic extrapolation of STA-QMC to lower $\bf q$ has been implemented in the GENIE MC generator for $\rm^{4}He$ and a similar extrapolation for ${\rm ^{12}C}$ is under development. Both approaches have the added benefit that the calculations are also directly applicable to the same kinematic regions for neutrino scattering. In addition we also report on a universal fit to all electron scattering data that can be used in lieu of experimental data for validation of Monte Carlo generators (and is in the process of being implemented in GENIE).</description>

      <title>Fast Perfekt: Regression-based refinement of fast simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of precise and accurate simulation is a limiting factor for interpreting and forecasting data in many fields of science and engineering. Often, one or more distinct simulation software applications are developed, each with a relative advantage in accuracy or speed. The quality of insights extracted from the data stands to increase if the accuracy of faster, more economical simulation could be improved to parity or near parity with more resource-intensive but accurate simulation. We present Fast Perfekt, a machine-learned regression that employs residual neural networks to refine the output of fast simulations. A deterministic morphing model is trained using a unique schedule that makes use of the ensemble loss function MMD, with the option of an additional pair-based loss function such as the MSE. We explore this methodology in the context of an abstract analytical model and in terms of a realistic particle physics application featuring jet properties in hadron collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The refinement makes maximum use of domain knowledge, and introduces minimal computational overhead to production.</description>

      <title>Search for $h_b(2P)\to\gamma\chi_{bJ}(1P)$ at $\sqrt{s} = 10.860$ GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the bottomonium sector, the hindered magnetic dipole (M1) transitions between P-wave states $h_b(2P) \rightarrow \chi_{bJ}(1P) \gamma$, $J=0, \, 1, \, 2$, are expected to be severely suppressed according to the Relativized Quark Model, due to the spin flip of the $b$ quark. Nevertheless, a recent model following the coupled-channel approach predicts the corresponding branching fractions to be enhanced by orders of magnitude. In this Letter, we report the first search for such transitions. We find no significant signals and set upper limits at 90% CL on the corresponding branching fractions: $\mathcal{B}[h_b(2P)\to\gamma\chi_{b0}(1P)] &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-1}$, $\mathcal{B}[h_b(2P)\to\gamma\chi_{b1}(1P)] &lt; 5.4 \times 10^{-3}$ and $\mathcal{B}[h_b(2P)\to\gamma\chi_{b2}(1P)] &lt; 1.3 \times 10^{-2}$. These values help to constrain the parameters of the coupled-channel models. The results are obtained using a $121.4 \, fb^{-1}$ data sample taken around $\sqrt{s}= 10.860 \, GeV$ with the Belle detector at the KEKB asymmetric-energy $e^+e^-$ collider.</description>

      <title>Design Studies Of A Pulsed Quasimonoenergetic 2-keV Neutron Source For Calibration Of Low Threshold Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe design studies for a pulsed quasi-monoenergetic 2-keV neutron source for calibration of sub-keV nuclear recoils. Such a calibration is required for detectors sensitive to sub-GeV dark matter and also the coherent elastic scattering of reactor neutrinos. In our design, neutrons from a commercial deuterium-tritium generator are moderated to the keV scale and then filtered to the monoenergetic spectrum using a feature in the neutron cross section of scandium. In this approach, unmoderated high-energy neutrons form a challenging background, along with gammas from neutron capture in the moderator materials. We describe the optimization of the moderator+filter and shielding geometry, and find a geometry that in simulation achieves both the target neutron flux at 2 keV and subdominant rates of background interactions. Lastly, we describe a future path to lower-energy (few eV scale) calibrations using time-of-flight and sub-keV neutrons.</description>

      <title>Electronics design and testing of the CMS Fast Beam Condition Monitor for HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) brings unprecedented requirements for precision bunch-by-bunch luminosity measurement and beam-induced background monitoring in real time. A key component of the CMS Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity detector system is a stand-alone luminometer, the Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM), which is able to operate independently at all times with a triggerless asynchronous readout. FBCM utilizes a dedicated front-end ASIC to amplify the signals from CO$_2$-cooled silicon-pad sensors with 1 ns timing resolution. Front-end (FE) electronics are subject to high-radiation conditions, thus all components are radiation hardened: sensors, ASICs, transceivers, etc. The FBCM ASIC contains 6 channels, each outputting a high-speed binary signal carrying the time-of-arrival and time-over-threshold information. This signal is sent via a gigabit optical link to the back-end electronics for analysis. A dedicated test system is designed for the FBCM FE electronics with a modular setup for all testing needs of the project from initial ASIC validation test to system-level testing with the full read-out chain. The paper reports on the design, read-out architecture, and testing program for the FBCM electronics.</description>

      <title>AutoFLUKA: A Large Language Model Based Framework for Automating Monte Carlo Simulations in FLUKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly using FLUKA, are essential for replicating real-world scenarios across scientific and engineering fields. Despite the robustness and versatility, FLUKA faces significant limitations in automation and integration with external post-processing tools, leading to workflows with a steep learning curve, which are time-consuming and prone to human errors. Traditional methods involving the use of shell and Python scripts, MATLAB, and Microsoft Excel require extensive manual intervention and lack flexibility, adding complexity to evolving scenarios. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents to address these limitations. AI agents, integrate natural language processing with autonomous reasoning for decision-making and adaptive planning, making them ideal for automation. We introduce AutoFLUKA, an AI agent application developed using the LangChain Python Framework to automate typical MC simulation workflows in FLUKA. AutoFLUKA can modify FLUKA input files, execute simulations, and efficiently process results for visualization, significantly reducing human labor and error. Our case studies demonstrate that AutoFLUKA can handle both generalized and domain-specific cases, such as Microdosimetry, with an streamlined automated workflow, showcasing its scalability and flexibility. The study also highlights the potential of Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) tools to act as virtual assistants for FLUKA, further improving user experience, time and efficiency. In conclusion, AutoFLUKA represents a significant advancement in automating MC simulation workflows, offering a robust solution to the inherent limitations. This innovation not only saves time and resources but also opens new paradigms for research and development in high energy physics, medical physics, nuclear engineering space and environmental science.</description>

      <title>Test of $T$-invariance in scattering of polarized protons on tensor-polarized deuterons at energies of the NICA SPD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of violation of $T$-invariance, provided that $P$-parity is preserved, is given by the total cross section of the interaction of a vector-polarized particle with a tensor-polarized target. A formalism for calculating this effect developed previously and based on the spin-dependent Glauber theory of elastic $pd$ scattering is used here to calculate the effect under discussion in the range of collision energies corresponding to the invariant mass of the $pN$ system $\sqrt{s_{pN}}=5$--$30$ GeV. The spin-dependent amplitudes of elastic $pN$ scattering required for this calculation are taken from existing phenomenological models for $pN$ scattering in the energy region considered.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Properties of Double-Strangeness Molecular Tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the study of $K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ molecular tetraquarks and the $H$-dibaryon, we focus on the mass spectra and electromagnetic properties of $\bar K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ systems, which exhibit exotic flavor quantum number of $ss\bar q \bar q$. A dynamical analysis is performed using the one-boson-exchange model to describe the effective interactions for these systems, accounting for both $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. By solving the coupled-channel Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation, we identify the $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K \bar K^*$ and $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K^* \bar K^*$ states as the most likely candidates for double-strangeness molecular tetraquarks. In addition, we investigate their magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay width, shedding light on their inner structures within the constituent quark model framework. Finally, we encourage experimentalists to focus on these predicted double-strangeness molecular tetraquark candidates, particularly in $B$ meson decays, by analyzing the $\bar K \bar K \pi$ invariant mass spectrum. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing the molecular tetraquark states in the light-quark sector.</description>

      <title>Measurement of gas properties for the ion-TPC of N$\nu$DEx experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the N$\nu$DEx collaboration, a high-pressure gas TPC is being developed to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay. The use of electronegative $\mathrm{^{82}SeF_{6}}$ gas mandates an ion-TPC. The reconstruction of $z$ coordinate is to be realized exploiting the feature of multiple species of charge carriers. As the initial stage of the development, we studied the properties of the $\mathrm{SF_{6}}$ gas, which is non-toxic and has similar molecular structure to $\mathrm{SeF_{6}}$. In the paper we present the measurement of drift velocities and mobilities of the majority and minority negative charge carriers found in $\mathrm{SF_{6}}$ at a pressure of 750 Torr, slightly higher than the local atmospheric pressure. The reduced fields range between 3.0 and 5.5 Td. It was performed using a laser beam to ionize the gas inside a small TPC, with a drift length of 3.7 cm. A customized charge sensitive amplifier was developed to read out the anode signals induced by the slowly drifting ions.

      <title>Virtual corrections to top-pair production from new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New physics and SM parameters can be studied and constrained by looking at the modifications to top-pair differential kinematical distributions due to off-shell effects. I present here three case studies: the determination of the Higgs couplings to the top-quark, a search for generic BSM scalar and pseudoscalar states, and a search for Axion Like Particles (ALP). The corresponding models have been implemented in the $\texttt{UFO}$ format to allow automatic computations within MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Resonance Schemes of Unstable Particles at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose practical ways of differentiating the various (Breit-Wigner, theoretical, and energy-dependent) resonance schemes of unstable particles at lepton colliders. First, the energy-dependent scheme can be distinguished from the other two by fitting the $Z$ lineshape scan and forward-backward asymmetries at LEP and future lepton colliders with the $Z$ mass $m_Z$, decay width $\Gamma_Z$, and coupling strength as fitting parameters. Although the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes work equally well, the scheme conversion requires the decay width $\Gamma_Z$ to scale inversely with $m_Z$ rather than the usual linear dependence from theoretical calculation. These contradicting behaviors can be used to distinguish the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes by the precision $Z$ measurements with single parameter ($m_Z$) fit at future lepton colliders. For the $WW$ threshold scan, its combination with the precise Fermi constant provides another way of distinguishing the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_c^+\to\eta\pi^+\Lambda$ reaction and the $\Lambda a_0^+(980)$ and $\pi^+\Lambda(1670)$ contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study from the theoretical point of view the $\Lambda_c^+\to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ reaction, recently measured by the Belle and BESIII Collaborations, where clear signals are observed for $a_0(980)$, $\Lambda(1670)$, and $\Sigma(1385)$ excitation. By considering the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ as dynamically generated resonances from the meson meson and meson baryon interaction, respectively, we are able to determine their relative production strength in the reaction, which is also tied to the strength of the $\pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ tree level contribution. We observe that this latter strength is very big and there are large destructive interferences between the tree level and the rescattering terms where the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ are generated. The $\Sigma(1385)$ contribution is included by means of a free parameter, the only one of the theory, up to a global normalization, when one considers only external emission, and we observe that the spin flip part of this term, usually ignored in theoretical and experimental works, plays an important role determining the shape of the mass distributions. Internal emission is also considered and it is found to play a minor role.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimisation in Deep Learning from Ensemble Methods: Applications to Proton Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models are defined in terms of a large number of hyperparameters, such as network architectures and optimiser settings. These hyperparameters must be determined separately from the model parameters such as network weights, and are often fixed by ad-hoc methods or by manual inspection of the results. An algorithmic, objective determination of hyperparameters demands the introduction of dedicated target metrics, different from those adopted for the model training. Here we present a new approach to the automated determination of hyperparameters in deep learning models based on statistical estimators constructed from an ensemble of models sampling the underlying probability distribution in model space. This strategy requires the simultaneous parallel training of up to several hundreds of models and can be effectively implemented by deploying hardware accelerators such as GPUs. As a proof-of-concept, we apply this method to the determination of the partonic substructure of the proton within the NNPDF framework and demonstrate the robustness of the resultant model uncertainty estimates. The new GPU-optimised NNPDF code results in a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude, a stabilisation of the memory requirements, and a reduction in energy consumption of up to 90% as compared to sequential CPU-based model training. While focusing on proton structure, our method is fully general and is applicable to any deep learning problem relying on hyperparameter optimisation for an ensemble of models.</description>

      <title>Learning New Physics from Data -- a Symmetrized Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thousands of person-years have been invested in searches for New Physics (NP), the majority of them motivated by theoretical considerations. Yet, no evidence of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has been found. This suggests that model-agnostic searches might be an important key to explore NP, and help discover unexpected phenomena which can inspire future theoretical developments. A possible strategy for such searches is identifying asymmetries between data samples that are expected to be symmetric within the Standard Model (SM). We propose exploiting neural networks (NNs) to quickly fit and statistically test the differences between two samples. Our method is based on an earlier work, originally designed for inferring the deviations of an observed dataset from that of a much larger reference dataset. We present a symmetric formalism, generalizing the original one; avoiding fine-tuning of the NN parameters and any constraints on the relative sizes of the samples. Our formalism could be used to detect small symmetry violations, extending the discovery potential of current and future particle physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: A search for long-lived particles (LLPs) using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of $pp$ collision data with $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC is presented. The search targets LLPs with masses between $5$ and $55$ GeV that decay hadronically in the ATLAS inner detector. Benchmark models with LLP pair production from exotic decays of the Higgs boson and models featuring long-lived axion-like particles (ALPs) are considered. No significant excess above the expected background is observed. Upper limits are placed on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson to pairs of LLPs, the cross-section for ALPs produced in association with a vector boson, and, for the first time, on the branching ratio of the top quark to an ALP and a $u/c$ quark.</description>

      <title>First double-differential cross section measurement of neutral-current $\pi^0$ production in neutrino-argon scattering in the MicroBooNE detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first double-differential cross section measurement of neutral-current neutral pion (NC$\pi^0$) production in neutrino-argon scattering, as well as single-differential measurements of the same channel in terms of final states with and without protons. The kinematic variables of interest for these measurements are the $\pi^0$ momentum and the $\pi^0$ scattering angle with respect to the neutrino beam. A total of 4971 candidate NC$\pi^0$ events fully-contained within the MicroBooNE detector are selected using data collected at a mean neutrino energy of $\sim 0.8$~GeV from $6.4\times10^{20}$ protons on target from the Booster Neutrino Beam at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. After extensive data-driven model validation to ensure unbiased unfolding, the Wiener-SVD method is used to extract nominal flux-averaged cross sections. The results are compared to predictions from commonly used neutrino event generators, which tend to overpredict the measured NC$\pi^0$ cross section, especially in the 0.2-0.5~GeV/c $\pi^0$ momentum range and at forward scattering angles. Events with at least one proton present in the final state are also underestimated. This data will help improve the modeling of NC$\pi^0$ production, which represents a major background in measurements of charge-parity violation in the neutrino sector and in searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Reactor neutrino liquid xenon coherent elastic scattering experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a unique probe for neutrino properties Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics. REactor neutrino LIquid xenon Coherent Scattering experiment (RELICS), a proposed reactor neutrino program using liquid xenon time projection chamber (LXeTPC) technology, aims to investigate the CEvNS process of antineutrinos off xenon atomic nuclei. In this work, the design of the experiment is studied and optimized based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To achieve a sufficiently low energy threshold for CEvNS detection, an ionization-only analysis channel is adopted for RELICS. A high emission rate of delayed electrons after a big ionization signal is the major background, leading to an analysis threshold of 120 photo-electrons in the CEvNS search. The second largest background, nuclear recoils induced by cosmic-ray neutrons, is suppressed via a passive water shield. The physics potential of RELICS is explored with a 32 kg*yr exposure at a baseline of 25 m from a reactor core with a 3 GW thermal power. In an energy range of 120 to 300 PE, corresponding to an average nuclear recoil from 0.63 to 1.36 keV considering the liquid xenon response and detector-related effect, we expect 4639.7 CEvNS and 1687.8 background events. The sensitivity of RELICS to the weak mixing angle is investigated at a low momentum transfer. Our study shows that RELICS can further improve the constraints on the non-standard neutrino interaction (NSI) compared to the current best results.</description>

      <title>The $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ pentaquark and its partners in the molecular picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration has detected a new hidden-charm pentaquark with the quantum numbers of a $\Lambda$ baryon: the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$. This pentaquark will be interpreted as a $\bar{D}_s \Lambda_c$-$\bar{D} \Xi_c$ resonance within a contact-range theory. Here we briefly comment on the relation of the new $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ with the $P^{\Lambda}_{\psi s}(4459)$. We find that the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ and $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ both accept a common description in terms of the same parameters, which predicts the existence of a few additional $P_{\psi}^N$, $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$, $P_{\psi s}^{\Sigma}$ and $P_{\psi s s}^{\Xi}$ molecular pentaquarks composed of a charmed antimeson and an antitriplet charmed baryon. The most robust of these predicted pentaquarks is a $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$ with a mass in the $(4235-4255)\,{\rm MeV}$ range, while other two interesting ones are a $P_{\psi}^{N}(4150)$ and a $P_{\psi}^{\Sigma}(4335)$, the latter basically at the same mass as the $P_{\psi}^{\Lambda}(4338)$, with which it might mix owing to isospin symmetry breaking effects.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the $P_c(4457)^+$ as the $P_{\psi}^{\Delta^+}(4457)$ isoquartet $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of the $P_{c}(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ pentaquarks is a fascinating theoretical question. Within the molecular picture their more usual interpretation is that of $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ bound states. Here we argue in favor of interpreting the $P_c(4457)$ pentaquark as a $I=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ bound state (with spin $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$) instead. Owing to isospin symmetry breaking effects, with this identification the partial decay width of the $P_c(4457)^+$ into $J/\psi p$ will be of the same order of magnitude as the $P_{c}(4312)^+$ and $P_c(4440)^+$, in contrast with the considerably larger partial decay width in the $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$ scenario. In turn, this leads to a different hidden-charm molecular pentaquark spectrum, in which there are only four or five $P_{\psi}^N$ bound states instead of the usual seven, which might explain why the predicted $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\tfrac{3}{2}$ ($I=\tfrac{1}{2}$) $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c^*$ molecular partners of the $P_c(4312)$ and $P_c(4440)$ have not been observed.</description>

      <title>Large lepton number violation at colliders: predictions from the minimal linear seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small neutrino masses can be sourced by a tiny vacuum expectation value of a leptophilic Higgs doublet, and mediated by Quasi-Dirac heavy neutrinos. In such simplest linear seesaw picture the neutrino mass mediators can be accessible to colliders. We describe novel charged Higgs and heavy neutrino production mechanisms that can be sizeable at $e^+ e^-$, $e^- \gamma$, $pp$, or muon colliders and discuss some of the associated signatures. The oscillation length of the heavy neutrino mediators is directly related to the light neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, lepton number violation can be large despite the smallness of neutrino masses, and may shed light on the Majorana nature of neutrinos and the significance of basic symmetries in weak interaction.</description>

      <title>Heavy- and light-flavor symmetry partners of the $T_{cc}^+(3875)$, the $X(3872)$ and the $X(3960)$ from light-meson exchange saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the charmed meson-(anti)meson system is a fundamental tool for disentangling the nature of a few exotic hadrons, including the recently discovered $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ tetraquark, the $X(3960)$, or the $X(3872)$, the nature of which is still not clear after almost two decades of its discovery. Here we consider that the charmed meson-(anti)meson short-range interaction is described by the exchange of light-mesons ($\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$). The effects of light-meson exchanges are recast into a simple contact-range theory by means of a saturation procedure, resulting in a compact description of the two-hadron interaction. From this, if the $T_{cc}^+$ were to be an isoscalar $D^* D$ molecule, then there should exist an isoscalar $J=1$ $D^* D^*$ partner, as constrained by heavy-quark spin symmetry. Yet, within our model, the most attractive two charmed meson configurations are the isovector $J=0$ $D^* D^*$ molecule and its sextet $D_s^* D^*$ and $D_s^* D_s^*$ flavor partners. Finally, we find a tension between the molecular descriptions of the $T_{cc}^+$ and that of the $X(3872)$ and $X(3960)$, where most parameter choices suggest that if the $T_{cc}^+$ is purely molecular then the $X(3872)$ overbinds (or conversely, if the $X(3872)$ is a molecule the $T_{cc}^+$ does not bind). This might be consequential for determining the nature of these states.</description>

      <title>Molecular charmed baryons and pentaquarks from light-meson exchange saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spectrum of the $c qq$ baryons contains a few states whose nature is not clearly a three-quark composite and which might have a sizable baryon-meson component. Examples include the $\Sigma_c(2800)$ or the $\Lambda_c(2940)$. Here we explore the spectrum of two-body systems composed of a light, octet baryon and a charmed meson (or antimeson) within a simple contact-range theory in which the couplings are saturated by light-meson exchanges. This results in the prediction of a series of composite anticharmed pentaquarks ($\bar{c} q qqq $) and singly-charmed baryons ($c \bar{q} qqq $). Among the later we find $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\Xi D$ and $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\Xi D^*$ bound states with masses matching those of the recently observed $\Omega_c(3185)$ and $\Omega_c(3327)$ baryons.</description>

      <title>A model independent description of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new parameterization of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ form factors using a partial-wave expansion and derive bounds on the series coefficients using analyticity and unitarity. This is the first generalization of the model-independent formalism developed by Boyd, Grinstein, and Lebed for $B \to D \ell \nu$ to semileptonic decays with multi-hadron final states, and enables data-driven form factor determinations with robust, systematically-improvable uncertainties. Using this formalism, we extract the form-factor parameters for $B \to D_2^\ast(\to D\pi) \ell \nu$ decays in a model-independent way from fits of data from the Belle Experiment, and, for the first time, study the two-pole structure in the $D\pi$ S-wave in semileptonic decays employing lineshapes from unitarized chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The SM expected branching ratio for $h \to \gamma \gamma$ and an excess for $h \to Z \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08190v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent measurements of $h \to Z \gamma$ from ATLAS and CMS show an excess of the signal strength $\mu_Z = (\sigma\cdot{\cal B})_{\mathrm{obs}}/(\sigma\cdot{\cal B})_{\mathrm{SM}}=2.2\pm 0.7$, normalized as 1 in the standard model~(SM). If confirmed, it would be a signal of new physics (NP) beyond the SM. We study NP explanation for this excess. In general, for a given model, it also affects the process $h \to \gamma \gamma$. Since the measured branching ratio for this process agrees well with the SM prediction, the model is severely constrained. We find that a minimally fermion singlets and doublet extended NP model can explain simultaneously the current data for $h \to Z \gamma$ and $h\to \gamma\gamma$. There are two solutions. Although both solutions enhance the amplitude of $h \to Z \gamma$ to the observed one, in one of the solutions the amplitude of $h \to \gamma \gamma$ flips sign to give the observ ed branching ratio. This seems to be a contrived solution although cannot be ruled out simply using branching ratio measurements alone. However, we find another solution that naturally enhances $h \to Z \gamma$ to the measured value, but keeps the amplitude of $h \to \gamma\gamma$ close to its SM prediction. We also comment on the phenomenology associated with these new fermions.</description>

      <title>Determination of Strong Coupling Constant from Inclusive Semileptonic Decays of Charmed Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16119v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the heavy quark expansion model with the kinetic scheme, we evaluate $\alpha_S(m_c^2)$, the strong coupling constant at the charm quark mass $m_c$ with data on inclusive semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Using the experimental values of semileptonic decay widths of the $D^0$ and the $D^+$, the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is determined to be $0.445\pm0.009\pm0.114$, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second systematic. This reported $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is in good agreement with the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ calculated by running $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)$ at the $Z^0$ boson mass $m_Z$ with the renormalization group evolution equation. In addition, values of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ obtained individually from each of the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons are found to be consistent being of the same origin.</description>

      <title>Higgs-boson production in the full theory at NNLO+PS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of a Standard-Model (SM) Higgs boson in gluon fusion in hadronic collisions and compute the QCD corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and match them to parton showers (NNLO+PS). The complete dependence on the top-quark mass is taken into account without making any approximations to the top quark loops mediating the coupling between the gluons and the Higgs boson. To this end, we have included the $gg\to H$ amplitudes up to three loops and the $pp\to H$+jet amplitudes up to two loops in the full SM theory. This is the first fully differential calculation of the top-quark mass effects up to NNLO in QCD, and we study their impact on relevant observables for the LHC.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting,we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. This application to the timelike region assumes an approximation based on unitarity and analyticity that is valid only in the large $q^2$ region. Using the recent data from BESIII we establish the regime of validity of this approximation. We report here that our results for the effective form factor (combination of $|G_E|$ and $|G_M|$) are in good agreement with the data already for $q^2$ values above 15 GeV$^2$. In addition, a more conservative onset of the validity of the approximation is provided by the newly available $|G_E/G_M|$ data which suggest that our predictions may be compared against data for $q^2 \ge $ 20 GeV$^2$. This is expected in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Charmonium-like states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 3^{-+}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the method of QCD sum rules to study the $q c \bar q \bar c$ tetraquark states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 3^{-+}$, and extract the mass of the lowest-lying state to be ${4.49^{+0.45}_{-0.41}}$ GeV. To construct the relevant tetraquark currents we need to explicitly add the covariant derivative operator. Our systematic analysis of these interpolating currents indicates that: a) this state readily decays into the $P$-wave $[\rho J/\psi] / [\omega J/\psi ]$ channel but not into the $ [\rho \chi_{c2}]/[\omega \chi_{c2}]/[J/\psi f_2(1270)]$ channels, and b) it readily decays into the $[D^* \bar D_2^*]$ channel but not into the $P$-wave $[D^* \bar D^*]$ channel.</description>

      <title>The European Strategy and Detector R&amp;D Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics stimulated the preparation of the European Detector Roadmap document in 2021 by the European Committee for Future Accelerators ECFA. This roadmap, defined during a bottom-up process by the community, outlines nine technology domains for HEP instrumentation and pinpoints urgent R&amp;D topics, known as Detector R&amp;D Themes (DRDTs). Task forces were set for each domain, leading to Detector R&amp;D Collaborations (DRDs), now hosted at CERN. After an intensive period over the last months, seven DRD collaborations have been established, which are now starting to set up their collaboration structures and begin to work. One is still in the preparation phase. In this publication, I will give an overview of the set-up process and the current status of all DRD collaborations covering detector developments in the field of gaseous detectors, noble liquid detectors for rare event searches, semiconductor detectors, photodetectors and concepts for particle ID, quantum sensors, calorimetry, electronics for HEP instrumentation and mechanical and integration aspects.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>
