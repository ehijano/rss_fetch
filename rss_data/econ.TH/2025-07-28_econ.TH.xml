      <title>Agentic AI and Hallucinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model a competitive market where AI agents buy answers from upstream generative models and resell them to users who differ in how much they value accuracy and in how much they fear hallucinations. Agents can privately exert effort for costly verification to lower hallucination risks. Since interactions halt in the event of a hallucination, the threat of losing future rents disciplines effort. A unique reputational equilibrium exists under nontrivial discounting. The equilibrium effort, and thus the price, increases with the share of users who have high accuracy concerns, implying that hallucination-sensitive sectors, such as law and medicine, endogenously lead to more serious verification efforts in agentic AI markets.</description>

      <title>Reputational cheap talk: influentialness and prior information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study a setting where a sender communicates her information about a hidden state with a receiver who wants to match his action with that state. The sender strives to appear informed at the receiver's expense. I characterize the receiver's tradeoff between relying on the sender or on prior information about the state when picking his action in all informative equilibria. I show that the receiver relies only on prior information, irrespective of how informed the sender may be, if and only if prior information is neither sufficiently noisy nor sufficiently informative. My results highlight a complementarity that informative prior information facilitates high-quality communication under reputation concern.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Double Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auctions are important mechanisms extensively implemented in various markets, e.g., search engines' keyword auctions, antique auctions, etc. Finding an optimal auction mechanism is extremely difficult due to the constraints of imperfect information, incentive compatibility (IC), and individual rationality (IR). In addition to the traditional economic methods, some recently attempted to find the optimal (single) auction using deep learning methods. Unlike those attempts focusing on single auctions, we develop deep learning methods for double auctions, where imperfect information exists on both the demand and supply sides. The previous attempts on single auction cannot directly apply to our contexts and those attempts additionally suffer from limited generalizability, inefficiency in ensuring the constraints, and learning fluctuations. We innovate in designing deep learning models for solving the more complex problem and additionally addressing the previous models' three limitations. Specifically, we achieve generalizability by leveraging a transformer-based architecture to model market participants as sequences for varying market sizes; we utilize the numerical features of the constraints and pre-treat them for a higher learning efficiency; we develop a gradient-conflict-elimination scheme to address the problem of learning fluctuation. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach to classical and machine learning baselines.</description>
