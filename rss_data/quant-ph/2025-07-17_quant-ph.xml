      <title>Lecture Notes on Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes begin in Chapter 1 with a review of linear algebra and the postulates of quantum mechanics, leading to an explanation of single- and multi-qubit gates. Chapter 2 explores the challenge of constructing arbitrary quantum states from given initial states, and introduces circuits for building oracles. Chapter 3 presents foundational algorithms such as entanglement creation, quantum teleportation, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Simon's algorithm.
  Chapters 4 and 5 cover algorithms based on the quantum Fourier transform, including phase estimation, period finding, factoring, and logarithm computation. These chapters also include complexity analysis and detailed quantum circuits suitable for implementation in code. Chapter 6 introduces Grover's algorithm for quantum search and amplitude amplification, including its realization via Hamiltonian simulation and a method for derandomization.
  Chapter 7 discusses basic techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, such as Lie-Trotter decomposition, sparse Hamiltonians, and the linear combination of unitaries. It also provides example circuits for simulating Hamiltonians expressed as linear combinations of Pauli operators. Chapter 8 introduces variational quantum algorithms, and Chapter 9 presents an algorithm for simulating fermionic many-particle systems, with an emphasis on molecular Hamiltonians. It also outlines the key transformations needed to map a molecular Hamiltonian to a form suitable for simulation on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Visualising Quantum Product Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypergraph product (HGP) is a famous code construction technique with an equally famous canonical visualisation. This visual perspective provides much more than simply a way to build intuition: HGP codes can be defined graphically, properties can be demonstrated graphically, and approaches to fault-tolerant logic have been developed graphically. In recent years two powerful generalisations of this product -- the lifted and balanced products -- have been proposed and employed to great success, but a unified graphical approach to describing these codes has been absent. In these notes I review the canonical approach to visualising HGP codes and then show how, via the addition of a third dimension, it can be generalised to apply to both the lifted and the balanced product. In the process we obtain clear intuition into various properties of these codes such as i) why it is hard to bound $k$ and $d$ ii) the issues with finding a canonical logical basis in the general case and iii) how the two products are related, and how they differ. I have attempted to structure these notes plainly and directly, so that the visual intuition can be easily obtained by those who want it while the rigorous justification is still available to those who demand it.</description>

      <title>k-Contextuality as a Heuristic for Memory Separations in Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical machine learning models struggle with learning and prediction tasks on data sets exhibiting long-range correlations. Previously, the existence of a long-range correlational structure known as contextuality was shown to inhibit efficient classical machine learning representations of certain quantum-inspired sequential distributions. Here, we define a new quantifier of contextuality we call strong k-contextuality, and prove that any translation task exhibiting strong k-contextuality is unable to be represented to finite relative entropy by a classical streaming model with fewer than k latent states. Importantly, this correlation measure does not induce a similar resource lower bound for quantum generative models. Using this theory as motivation, we develop efficient algorithms which estimate our new measure of contextuality in sequential data, and empirically show that this estimate is a good predictor for the difference in performance of resource-constrained classical and quantum Bayesian networks in modeling the data. Strong k-contextuality thus emerges as a measure to help identify problems that are difficult for classical computers, but may not be for quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Rise and fall of nonstabilizerness via random measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of nonstabilizerness - also known as `magic' - in monitored quantum circuits composed of random Clifford unitaries and local projective measurements. For measurements in the computational basis, we derive an analytical model for dynamics of the stabilizer nullity, showing that it decays in quantized steps and requires exponentially many measurements to vanish, which reveals the strong protection through Clifford scrambling. On the other hand, for measurements performed in rotated non-Clifford bases, measurements can both create and destroy nonstabilizerness. Here, the dynamics leads to a steady-state with non-trivial nonstabilizerness, independent of the initial state. We find that Haar-random states equilibrate in constant time, whereas stabilizer states exhibit linear-in-size relaxation time. While the stabilizer nullity is insensitive to the rotation angle, Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies expose a richer structure in their dynamics. Our results uncover sharp distinctions between coarse and fine-grained nonstabilizerness diagnostics and demonstrate how measurements can both suppress and sustain quantum computational resources.</description>

      <title>Dynamics Simulation of Arbitrary Non-Hermitian Systems Based on Quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11675v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems exhibit unique properties and hold significant promise for diverse applications, yet their dynamical simulation poses a particular challenge due to intrinsic openness and non-unitary evolution. Here, we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm based on Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) for simulating the dynamics of arbitrary time-dependent non-Hermitian systems. Notably, this approach constitutes a natural extension of the quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) algorithm. This algorithm combines the advantages of both classical and quantum computation and exhibits good applicability and adaptability, making it promising for simulating arbitrary non-Hermitian systems such as PT-symmetric systems, non-physical processes, and open quantum systems. To validate the algorithm, we applied it to the dynamic simulation of open quantum systems and achieved the desired results.</description>

      <title>Notions of Adiabatic Drift in the Quantized Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a quantized, discrete and drifting version of the Harper Hamiltonian, also called the finite almost Mathieu operator, which resembles the pendulum Hamiltonian but in phase space is confined to a torus. Spacing between pairs of eigenvalues of the operator spans many orders of magnitude, with nearly degenerate pairs of states at energies that are associated with circulating orbits in the associated classical system. When parameters of the system slowly vary, both adiabatic and diabatic transitions can take place at drift rates that span many orders of magnitude. Only under an extremely negligible drift rate would all transitions into superposition states be suppressed. The wide range of energy level spacings could be a common property of quantum systems with non-local potentials that are related to resonant classical dynamical systems. Notions for adiabatic drift are discussed for quantum systems that are associated with classical ones with divided phase space.</description>

      <title>Time-Aware Qubit Assignment and Circuit Optimization for Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging paradigm of distributed quantum computing promises a potential solution to scaling quantum computing to currently unfeasible dimensions. While this approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be overcome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and algorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this paradigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network constraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of quantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are divided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually and simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum channels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation, is expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning qubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways. First by applying time-aware algorithms that take into account the changing connectivity of a given circuit as well as the underlying network topology. We define the optimization problem, use simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm and compare the results to graph partitioning and sequential qubit assignment baselines. In another approach, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum circuit optimization algorithm that adjusts the circuit itself rather than the schedule to reduce the overall communication cost. We evaluate the techniques against random circuits and different network topologies. Both evolutionary algorithms outperform the baseline in terms of communication cost reduction. We give an outlook on how the approaches can be integrated into a compilation framework for distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Separation of relaxation timescales via strong system-bath coupling: Dissipative three-level system as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically demonstrate that strong system-bath coupling separates the relaxation dynamics of a dissipative quantum system into two distinct regimes: a short-time dynamics that, as expected, accelerates with increasing coupling to the environment, and a slow dynamics that, counterintuitively, becomes increasingly prolonged at sufficiently strong coupling. Using the reaction-coordinate polaron-transform mapping, we uncover the general mechanism behind this effect and derive accurate expressions for both relaxation timescales. Numerical simulations confirm our analytical predictions. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that strong coupling to a dissipative bath can autonomously generate and sustain long-lived quantum coherences, offering a promising strategy for bath-engineered quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Can entanglement be mediated by a Koopmanian system?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for coupling a Koopmanian classical system to two quantum bits to mediate an interaction between them. We then prove that the resulting dynamics can never lead to entanglement between the two qubits. Even though the total system of two qubits and the Koopmanian classical system are described with the full quantum formalism, we show that their composite system violates exact conservation laws as expected for a hybrid quantum-classical system. We finally discuss the implications for semi-classical treatments of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-additive measures for quantum probability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that quantum probability does not follow classical Kolmogorov probability calculus. Various approaches have been developed to loosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful (e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort Assumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures, which are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the count of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role in classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If one tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify the count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of probability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is something that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of this paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience that is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not necessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful discussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the link between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the measure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum mechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some properties of this "quantum measure", its reasonableness in terms of the physics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a set of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a generalization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended probability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of physically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).</description>

      <title>The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad generation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory of open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. A complete exposition of this theorem is given. The finite-dimensional case is handled using a form of Jamio\l{}kowski transform. The treatment requires no previous knowledge of complete positivity and obtains the Choi-Kraus presentation along the way. The (separable) infinite-dimensional case is handled by means of a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations, using the finite-dimensional case as a crucial tool. An extension to time-dependent generator is also given.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the free states of one quantum resource theory as resource states of another</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of quantum resource theories (QRTs), free states are defined as those which can be obtained at no cost under a certain restricted set of conditions. However, when taking a free state from one QRT and evaluating it through the optics of another QRT, it might well turn out that the state is now extremely resourceful. Such realization has recently prompted numerous works characterizing states across several QRTs. In this work we contribute to this body of knowledge by analyzing the resourcefulness in free states for--and across witnesses of--the QRTs of multipartite entanglement, fermionic non-Gaussianity, imaginarity, realness, spin coherence, Clifford non-stabilizerness, $S_n$-equivariance and non-uniform entanglement. We provide rigorous theoretical results as well as present numerical studies that showcase the rich and complex behavior that arises in this type of cross-examination.</description>

      <title>Tripartite Entanglement in Multimode Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the generation and dynamics of tripartite entanglement among qubits (quantum emitters or atoms) in multimode cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Our cQED architecture features three initially unentangled excited two-level quantum emitters confined within a triangle-shaped multimode optical cavity, which later become entangled due to a Jaynes-Cummings-like interaction. Using the tripartite negativity measure of entanglement and fidelity with respect to the genuine tripartite entangled state (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (or GHZ) state, to be precise), we analyze the impact of the number of cavity modes, qubit locations, and losses (spontaneous emission from qubits and photon leakage from the cavity mirrors) on the generated entanglement. Our key results include the presence of two kinds of retardation effects: one resulting from the time it takes for photons to propagate from one qubit to another, and the other to complete one round trip in the cavity. We observed these retardation effects only in multimode cavities, with the exciting possibility of controlling the collapse and revival patterns of tripartite entanglement by altering the qubit locations in the cavity. Furthermore, the impact of losses on the generated entanglement and the dependence of maximum entanglement on the total number of modes yield results that surpass those reported for single and two excitations. With recent advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics, these findings hold promise for the development of entanglement-based quantum networking protocols and quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum noise reduction in a Raman amplifier via quantum correlation between atom and light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Any amplifier requires coupling to its internal degrees of freedom for energy gain. This coupling introduces extra quantum noise to the output. On the other hand, if the internal degree of the amplifier can be accessed and manipulated, we can manage and even reduce the quantum noise of the amplifier's output. In this paper, we present an experiment to reduce the quantum noise of a Raman amplifier by preparing the atomic medium in a correlated state with the Stokes light field. We report an observation of quantum noise reduction of more than 3.5 dB in the atomic Raman amplification process. From another perspective, the Raman amplifier at high gain in turn serves as a measurement tool for the quantum correlation between the atom and light. Furthermore, such a scheme, when viewed as a whole, also forms a quantum-entangled atom-light hybrid interferometer that can lead to quantum-enhanced sensors.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced Quantum Mpemba effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect (QMPE), an intriguing anomalous relaxation phenomenon, has recently attracted significant attention. However, how various types of noise, which are ubiquitous in real systems, may affect the QMPE remains unknown. Here, we address this gap by constructing a general dynamical framework for d level open quantum systems under random telegraph noise. By investigating the dynamics of an extended system and then projecting back, we find that noise can induce additional modes and strongly influence the relaxation dynamics of the original system. Specially, in the limit of long correlation time of noise, these modes cause anomalous slowdown for certain initial states, thereby inducing or eliminating QMPE, illustrated by a three-level example system. Interestingly, this mechanism leads to a counter intuitive effect:the decoherence rate may be slowed down by noise.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous High-Fidelity Single-Qubit Gates in a Spin Qubit Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon spin qubits are a promising platform for scalable quantum computing due to their compatibility with industrial semiconductor fabrication and the recent scaling to multi-qubit devices. Control fidelities above the 99% fault-tolerant threshold are routinely achieved, but extending high-fidelity control to simultaneous multi-qubit operation remains a major challenge. We demonstrate high-fidelity, fully parallel control of five silicon spin qubits using a single shared microwave line. Using tailored control pulses, all qubits achieve primitive $\pi/2$ gate fidelities well above 99.99%, with some approaching 99.999%, exceeding previously reported fidelities in silicon spin qubits. These fidelities are mostly preserved during simultaneous operation of up to three qubits, and remain at the practical fault-tolerant threshold of 99.9% even during fully parallel five-qubit operation. This performance is enabled by a calibration scheme that compensates drive-induced phase shifts using only pairwise calibrations, scaling quadratically with qubit number and avoiding exponential overhead. By reducing the number of impedance-controlled microwave lines, our approach addresses a key architectural bottleneck and offers a scalable control strategy for high-fidelity operation in large spin qubit arrays.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in a Disordered XX Spin Chain: A Real-Space Renormalization Group Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin chains with quenched disorder exhibit rich critical behavior, often captured by real-space renormalization group (RSRG) techniques. However, the physics of such systems in the presence of random measurements (i.e., non-Hermitian dephasing) remains largely unexplored. The interplay between measurements and unitary dynamics gives rise to novel phases and phase transitions in monitored quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the disordered XX spin chain subject to stochastic local measurements in the $X$ and $Y$ bases. By mapping the monitored chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder with complex couplings, we propose an RSRG-for-excited-states (RSRG-X) approach for this open-system setting. Our analysis reveals a new class of strongly disordered fixed points that emerge due to non-unitarity, broadening the landscape of critical phenomena accessible via RSRG.</description>

      <title>Obfuscation of Unitary Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model.
  In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.</description>

      <title>QAS-QTNs: Curriculum Reinforcement Learning-Driven Quantum Architecture Search for Quantum Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) is an emerging field aimed at automating the design of quantum circuits for optimal performance. This paper introduces a novel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with quantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle increasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN, TD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for optimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively increases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging parameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning efficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are augmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a 2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with ~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the more complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities of ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively, outperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN approach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit achieves an accuracy of 90.33\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of random ansatz. This hybrid classical-quantum approach leads to faster convergence and more efficient quantum circuit designs, demonstrating its potential for advancing automated quantum architecture search.</description>

      <title>Extending the Limited Performance of the Quantum Refrigerator with Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermal machines offer promising platforms for exploring the fundamental limits of thermodynamics at the microscopic scale. Here, we study a two-stroke quantum refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold reservoir via discrete strokes powered by external work. The working medium consists of two two-level systems (TLSs) and two heat reservoirs at different temperatures and is assisted by an auxiliary system acting as a catalyst. Remarkably, the catalyst remains unchanged after each cycle, ensuring that heat extraction is driven entirely by the work input. We show that the presence of the catalyst leads to two significant enhancements: it enables the coefficient of performance (COP) to exceed the Otto bound and allows the refrigerator to operate in frequency and temperature regimes that are inaccessible without a catalyst. These results highlight the potential of catalytic mechanisms to broaden the operational capabilities of quantum thermal devices and to surpass conventional thermodynamic performance limits.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking fault-tolerant quantum computing hardware via QLOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely recognized that quantum computing has profound impacts on multiple fields, including but not limited to cryptography, machine learning, materials science, etc. To run quantum algorithms, it is essential to develop scalable quantum hardware with low noise levels and to design efficient fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) schemes. Currently, various FTQC schemes have been developed for different hardware platforms. However, a comprehensive framework for the analysis and evaluation of these schemes is still lacking. In this work, we propose Quantum Logical Operations Per Second (QLOPS) as a metric for assessing the performance of FTQC schemes on quantum hardware platforms. This benchmarking framework will integrate essential relevant factors, e.g., the code rates of quantum error-correcting codes, the accuracy, throughput, and latency of the decoder, and reflect the practical requirements of quantum algorithm execution. This framework will enable the identification of bottlenecks in quantum hardware, providing potential directions for their development. Moreover, our results will help establish a comparative framework for evaluating FTQC designs. As this benchmarking approach considers practical applications, it may assist in estimating the hardware resources needed to implement quantum algorithms and offers preliminary insights into potential timelines.</description>

      <title>A resource-centric, task-based approach to quantum network control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks exhibit fundamental differences from their classical counterparts. These differences necessitate novel principles when organizing, managing, and operating them. Here we propose an unconventional approach to organize and manage the operations of quantum network devices. Instead of a hierarchical scheme using layers, like in classical networks and present quantum network stack models, we propose a resource-centric task-based scheme. In this scheme, quantum applications pose objectives, initiated by a node, to a quantum network, such as sharing an entangled state or sending a qubit along a path. The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a distributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating on resources, which completes the objective. We identify three different kinds of resources with their own and independent topology, namely classical messaging, quantum channels and entanglement. Sagas can either be centrally orchestrated or performed in choreography by the network nodes. The tasks of a saga originate from and operate on resources of the network, such as quantum channels or entanglement, and they not only comprise operations and measurements, but potentially also include other tasks or even entire protocols, such as sending a qubit, distributing entanglement or performing entanglement purification steps.</description>

      <title>Optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation enhanced by non-Gaussian distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capability of magnons to coherently couple with various quantum systems makes them an ideal candidate to build hybrid quantum systems. The optomagnonic coupling is essential for constructing a hybrid magnonic quantum network, as the transmission of quantum information among remote quantum nodes must be accomplished using light rather than microwave field. Here we provide an optomagnonic continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol, which enables the transfer of an input optical state to a remote magnon mode. To overcome the currently relatively weak coupling in the experiment, we introduce non-Gaussian distillation operations to enhance the optomagnonic entanglement and thus the fidelity of the teleportation. An auxiliary microwave cavity is adopted to realize the non-Gaussian and displacement operations on magnons. We show that a series of optical states, such as coherent, single-photon, squeezed and cat states, can be teleported to the magnon mode. The work provides guidance for the experimental realization of magnonic quantum repeaters and quantum networks and a new route to prepare diverse magnonic quantum states exploiting the photon-to-magnon quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Generation of Near-ideal Indistinguishable Two-Photon State by Incoherent Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality quantum states lie at the heart of advanced quantum information processing. The degree of photon indistinguishability is critical for applications from photonic quantum computation to precision metrology. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference effect provides a rigorous quantification method, with its visibility serving as the ultimate benchmark for source quality. Generally, the coherent pumping is widely regarded as indispensable for the preparation of quantum sources. As a result, incoherent light sources have seen limited applications in the current quantum technologies. In this work, we generate an indistinguishable two-photon state by incoherent light generated by frequency doubling of Amplified Spontaneous Emission light. The theoretical analysis indicates that phase randomization of the pumping does not affect the coincidence visibility in two-photon intensity interference. Moreover, temporal incoherence further enhances the symmetry of the generated spectrum in second-harmonic generation. In the experiment, the incoherently pumped photon sources exhibit a heralding efficiency of approximately 60\% and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio exceeding 15000. The observed HOM interference fringes show the visibility of 99.1\% without any spectrum filtering, confirming the near-ideal indistinguishability of the photons. Our study reveals the role of temporal coherence in second-order nonlinear interactions, it provide a potential approach to use an easily accessible incoherent light for engineering high-quality quantum sources.</description>

      <title>A thermofield-double model of Uhlmann anholonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple parametrized family of quantum systems consisting of two entangled subsystems, dubbed left and right ones, both of them featuring N qubits is considered in the thermofield double formalism. We assume that the system evolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition due to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution relative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems. The Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding one of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of freedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on the left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of non-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic evolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a holonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing the transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional instantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic triangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By analysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on the left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for distinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point out that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can observe the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We demonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and visibility patterns arising in such interference experiments. Finally a sequence of geodesic triangles producing the iSWAP gate via anholonomy needed for computational universality is presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Multi-Qubit Phase-Space Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</description>

      <title>Cutting Slack: Quantum Optimization with Slack-Free Methods for Combinatorial Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12159v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint handling remains a key bottleneck in quantum combinatorial optimization. While slack-variable-based encodings are straightforward, they significantly increase qubit counts and circuit depth, challenging the scalability of quantum solvers. In this work, we investigate a suite of Lagrangian-based optimization techniques including dual ascent, bundle methods, cutting plane approaches, and augmented Lagrangian formulations for solving constrained combinatorial problems on quantum simulators and hardware. Our framework is applied to three representative NP-hard problems: the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the Multi-Dimensional Knapsack Problem (MDKP), and the Maximum Independent Set (MIS).
  We demonstrate that MDKP and TSP, with their inequality-based or degree-constrained structures, allow for slack-free reformulations, leading to significant qubit savings without compromising performance. In contrast, MIS does not inherently benefit from slack elimination but still gains in feasibility and objective quality from principled Lagrangian updates. We benchmark these methods across classically hard instances, analyzing trade-offs in qubit usage, feasibility, and optimality gaps. Our results highlight the flexibility of Lagrangian formulations as a scalable alternative to naive QUBO penalization, even when qubit savings are not always achievable. This work provides practical insights for deploying constraint-aware quantum optimization pipelines, with applications in logistics, network design, and resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Mobility rings in a non-Hermitian non-Abelian quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'{e} chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition. Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number, non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied. The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression, which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.</description>

      <title>BenchRL-QAS: Benchmarking reinforcement learning algorithms for quantum architecture search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future research https://github.com/azhar-ikhtiarudin/bench-rlqas.</description>

      <title>A solid-state temporally multiplexed quantum memory array at the single-photon level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of multimodality in different degrees of freedom is one of the most promising ways to increase the rate of heralded entanglement between distant quantum nodes. In this paper, we realize a spatially-multiplexed solid-state quantum memory array with ten individually controllable spin-wave memory cells featuring on-demand read-out and temporal multiplexing. By combining spatial and temporal multiplexing, we store weak coherent pulses at the single-photon level in up to 250 spatio-temporal modes, with an average signal-to-noise ratio of 10(2). We perform a thorough characterization of the whole system, including its multiplexing and demultiplexing stage. We verify that the memory array exhibits low cross-talk even at the single-photon level. The measured performance indicates readiness for storing non-classical states and promises a speed-up in entanglement distribution rates.</description>

      <title>What are we talking about when we discuss the Born-Oppenheimer approximation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nick Huggett, James Ladyman, and Karim Thebault (HLT) have presented a comprehensive article examining the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA). Their central objective is to challenge our position on the matter-namely, that the BOA incorporates a classical assumption incompatible with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In contrast, HLT contend that the BOA involves no such classical assumption and, as a result, supports the view that chemistry can be reduced to physics. The purpose of this paper is to offer a critical analysis of the HLT article and to clarify why we consider their arguments unpersuasive.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.</description>

      <title>Design Automation in Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) underpins practical fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) by addressing the fragility of quantum states and mitigating decoherence-induced errors. As quantum devices scale, integrating robust QEC protocols is imperative to suppress logical error rates below threshold and ensure reliable operation, though current frameworks suffer from substantial qubit overheads and hardware inefficiencies. Design automation in the QEC flow is thus critical, enabling automated synthesis, transpilation, layout, and verification of error-corrected circuits to reduce qubit footprints and push fault-tolerance margins. This chapter presents a comprehensive treatment of design automation in QEC, structured into four main sections. The first section delves into the theoretical aspects of QEC, covering logical versus physical qubit representations, stabilizer code construction, and error syndrome extraction mechanisms. In the second section, we outline the QEC design flow, detailing the areas highlighting the need for design automation. The third section surveys recent advancements in design automation techniques, including algorithmic $T$-gate optimization, modified surface code architecture to incorporate lesser qubit overhead, and machine-learning-based decoder automation. The final section examines near-term FTQC architectures, integrating automated QEC pipelines into scalable hardware platforms and discussing end-to-end verification methodologies. Each section is complemented by case studies of recent research works, illustrating practical implementations and performance trade-offs. Collectively, this chapter aims to equip readers with a holistic understanding of design automation in QEC system design in the fault-tolerant landscape of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Quantum Circuit Design for the Lattice Boltzmann Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows at high Reynolds numbers remains a major challenge for traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools running on classical computer hardware. This has motivated growing interest in quantum algorithms for CFD to enable flow simulations on quantum computers. The reason being that these computers are expected to deliver potential speed-ups for certain problems. One promising quantum CFD approach is a fully quantum implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method called QLBM. Although efficient quantum routines are now available for the streaming step, implementing the nonlinear, irreversible collision step with a low depth circuit that avoids additional ancilla qubits, probabilistic post-selection and repeated executions remains a significant challenge. In this study, we address this challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum circuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision operator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the physical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum conservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance. When compiled to the gate set used by IBM Heron processor under the assumption of full qubit connectivity, the 15 block SQC requires only 2,430 native gates and uses neither ancilla qubits nor post-selection or repeated executions. Moreover, its depth is independent of the grid resolution, as collision is a local operation that can exploit quantum parallelism to its full extent. We validate the SQC on two benchmark flows, the Taylor Green vortex decay and the lid driven cavity, demonstrating that it accurately captures vortex dissipation and flow recirculation.</description>

      <title>Approximating fixed size quantum correlations in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that $\varepsilon$-additive approximations of the optimal value of fixed-size two-player free games with fixed-dimensional entanglement assistance can be computed in time $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$. This stands in contrast to previous analytic approaches, which focused on scaling with the number of questions and answers, but yielded only strict $\mathrm{exp}(1/\varepsilon)$ guarantees. Our main result is based on novel Bose-symmetric quantum de Finetti theorems tailored for constrained quantum separability problems. These results give rise to semidefinite programming (SDP) outer hierarchies for approximating the entangled value of such games. By employing representation-theoretic symmetry reduction techniques, we demonstrate that these SDPs can be formulated and solved with computational complexity $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$, thereby enabling efficient $\varepsilon$-additive approximations. In addition, we introduce a measurement-based rounding scheme that translates the resulting outer bounds into certifiably good inner sequences of entangled strategies. These strategies can, for instance, serve as warm starts for see-saw optimization methods. We believe that our techniques are of independent interest for broader classes of constrained separability problems in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty and entropies of classical channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, I studied a mathematical development to define and quantify the uncertainty inherent in classical channels. This thesis starts with the introduction and background on how to formally think about uncertainty in the domain of classical states. The concept of probability vector majorization and its variants, relative majorization and conditional majorization, are reviewed. This thesis introduces three conceptually distinct approaches to formalize the notion of uncertainty inherent in classical channels. These three approaches define the same preordering on the domain of classical channels, leading to characterizations from many perspectives. With the solid foundation of uncertainty comparison, classical channel entropy is then defined to be an additive monotone with respect to the majorization relation. The well-known entropies in the domain of classical states are uniquely extended to the domain of channels via the optimal extensions, providing not only a solid foundation but also the quantifiers of uncertainty inherent in classical channels.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum lattice model: Polaritons, photons, and spin waves propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the propagation of quantum excitations in low-dimensional quantum systems is pivotal for advancing quantum technologies, including communication networks and quantum simulators. We propose a one-dimensional hybrid quantum lattice model comprising coupled cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) units. Each unit integrates a single-mode cavity that interacts with a two-level system (TLS), featuring direct coupling between adjacent TLLs. This configuration enables the coherent propagation of polaritons, spin waves, and photons, depending on the interplay between light-matter coupling and spin-spin interactions. Employing the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm, we simulate the dynamics of various excitation configurations and analyze their transport characteristics using local observables. Our analysis reveals the importance of matching impedance and resonance conditions via system parameters for the propagation of different types of excitations or swapping the nature of excitations along the hybrid lattice. These findings offer insight into designing controllable quantum links and single-excitation swaps in low-dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Tailored Quantum Device Calibration with Statistical Model Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum devices require precisely calibrated analog signals, a process that is complex and time-consuming. Many calibration strategies exist, and all require careful analysis and tuning to optimize system availability. To enable rigorous statistical evaluation of quantum calibration procedures, we leverage statistical model checking (SMC), a technique used in fields that require statistical guarantees. SMC allows for probabilistic evaluation of properties of interest, such as a certain parameter's time to failure. We extend the SMC for Processor Analysis (SPA) framework, which uses SMC for evaluation of classical systems, to create SPA for Quantum calibration (SPAQ) enabling simplified tuning and analysis of quantum system calibration. We focus on a directed acyclic graph-based calibration optimization scheme and demonstrate how to craft properties of interest for its analysis. We show how to use SPAQ to find lower bounds of time to failure information, hidden node dependencies, and parameter threshold values and use that information to improve simulated quantum system availability through calibration scheme adjustments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the extendability-based semi-definite programming hierarchy introduced by Berta et al. [Mathematical Programming, 1 - 49 (2021)], which provides converging outer bounds on the optimal fidelity of approximate quantum error correction (AQEC). As our first contribution, we introduce a measurement-based rounding scheme that extracts inner sequences of certifiably good encoder-decoder pairs from this outer hierarchy. To address the computational complexity of evaluating fixed levels of the hierarchy, we investigate the use of symmetry-based dimension reduction. In particular, we combine noise symmetries - such as those present in multiple copies of the qubit depolarizing channel - with the permutational symmetry arising from the extendability of the optimization variable. This framework is illustrated through basic, but already challenging numerical examples that showcase its practical effectiveness. Our results contribute to narrowing the gap between theoretical developments in quantum information theory and their practical applications in the analysis of small-scale quantum error-correcting codes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) use the inherent unpredictability of quantum mechanics to generate true randomness, as opposed to classical random number generators. However, ensuring the authenticity of this randomness still requires robust verification. Self-testing QRNGs address this need by enabling the validation of the randomness produced based on the observed data from the experiment while requiring few assumptions. In this work, we present a practical, self-testing QRNG designed to operate with an untrusted measurement device and a partially characterized source, allowing the user to check the adequate functioning of the setup in real time. Our experiment yields a rate of certified random bits of 450kbps</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic entangling measurements are key operations in linear-optical quantum technologies, enabling the generation and manipulation of high-dimensional quantum states. While prior research has focused predominantly on specific entangled states, notably graph states and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, broader classes of states with variable entanglement remain underexplored. In this work, we present a linear-optical approach for generating and fusing GHZ-like states, which generalize standard GHZ states to include variable entanglement degrees. We introduce two schemes based on modified fusion gates that allow flexible control over generation efficiency and the entanglement of the output states. These results offer a promising pathway toward resource-efficient entangled-state generation for scalable quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ground States: Physics-Inspired Optimization of Excited States of Classical Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce excited local quantum annealing (ExcLQA), a classical, physics-inspired algorithm that extends local quantum annealing (LQA) to identify excited states of classical Ising Hamiltonians. LQA simulates quantum annealing while constraining the quantum state to remain in a product state and uses a gradient-based approach to find approximate solutions to large-scale quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems. ExcLQA extends this framework by adding a penalty term in the cost function to target excited states, with a single hyperparameter that can be tuned via binary search to set the desired penalization level. We benchmark ExcLQA on the shortest vector problem (SVP), a fundamental lattice problem underlying the security of many postquantum cryptographic schemes. Solving an SVP instance can be mapped to identifying the first excited state of a Hamiltonian, with approximate solutions located among nearby excited states. Our results show that ExcLQA manages to solve SVP instances up to rank 46, and outperforms the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in solved ratio, number of shots, and approximation factor in the tested instances.</description>

      <title>Bounding the asymptotic quantum value of all multipartite compiled non-local games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-local games are a powerful tool to distinguish between correlations possible in classical and quantum worlds. Kalai et al. (STOC'23) proposed a compiler that converts multipartite non-local games into interactive protocols with a single prover, relying on cryptographic tools to remove the assumption of physical separation of the players. While quantum completeness and classical soundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games, quantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.
  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing that any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond to quantum commuting strategies.
  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on a characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as quantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby generalising several previous results. On the way, we construct universal C*-algebras of sequential PVMs and prove a new chain rule for Radon-Nikodym derivatives of completely positive maps on C*-algebras which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Cooling of Planar Motion in a Penning Trap Ion Crystal to Sub-Millikelvin Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional planar ion crystals in a Penning trap are a platform for quantum information science experiments. However, the low-frequency planar modes of these crystals are not efficiently cooled by laser cooling, which can limit the utility of the drumhead modes for quantum information processing. Recently, it has been shown that nonlinear mode coupling can enhance the cooling of the low-frequency planar modes. Here, we demonstrate in numerical simulations that this coupling can be dynamically tuned by adiabatically changing the rotation frequency of the ion crystal during experiments. Furthermore, we show that this technique can, in addition, produce lower temperatures for the low-frequency planar modes via an adiabatic cooling process. This result allows cooling of the planar modes to sub-millikelvin temperatures, resulting in improved spectral resolution of the drumhead modes at experimentally relevant rotation frequencies, which is crucial for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg limited multiple eigenvalue estimation via off-the-grid compressed sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase estimation is the flagship algorithm for quantum simulation on fault-tolerant quantum computers. We demonstrate that an \emph{off-grid} compressed sensing protocol, combined with a state-of-the-art signal classification method, enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple eigenvalues of a unitary matrix using the Hadamard test while sampling only a few percent of the full autocorrelation function. Our numerical evidence indicates that the proposed algorithm achieves the Heisenberg limit in both strongly and weakly correlated regimes and requires very short evolution times to obtain an $\epsilon$-accurate estimate of multiple eigenvalues at once.
  Additionally -- and of independent interest -- we develop a modified off-grid protocol that leverages prior knowledge of the underlying signal for faster and more accurate recovery. Finally, we argue that this algorithm may offer a potential quantum advantage by analyzing its resilience with respect to the quality of the initial input state.</description>

      <title>Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations -- such as the Toffoli gate -- remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in standard decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-QSSEP: A toy model for entanglement spreading in stochastic diffusive quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate out-of-equilibrium entanglement dynamics in a generalization of the so-called $QSSEP$ model, which is a free-fermion chain with stochastic in space and time hopping amplitudes. In our setup, the noisy amplitudes are spatially-modulated satisfying a $\nu$-site translation invariance but retaining their randomness in time. For each noise realization, the dynamics preserves Gaussianity, which allows to obtain noise-averaged entanglement-related quantities. The statistics of the steady-state correlators satisfy nontrivial relationships that are of topological nature. They reflect the Haar invariance under multiplication with structured momentum-dependent random $SU(\nu)$ matrices. We discuss in detail the case with $\nu=1$ and $\nu=2$. For $\nu=1$, i.e., spatially homogeneous noise we show that the entanglement dynamics is describable by a stochastic generalization of the quasiparticle picture. Precisely, entanglement is propagated by pairs of quasiparticles. The entanglement content of the pairs is the same as for the deterministic chain. However, the trajectories of the quasiparticles are random walks, giving rise to diffusive entanglement growth.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuits are just a phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum programs today are written at a low level of abstraction - quantum circuits akin to assembly languages - and even advanced quantum programming languages essentially function as circuit description languages. This state of affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed.
  To this end, we introduce a novel yet simple quantum programming language for generating unitaries from "just a phase"; we combine a (global) phase operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the "if let" construct that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus from quantum gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design.
  We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured quantum programming.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents correspondence between Albert Einstein and the mathematical analyst J. L. B. Cooper on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox of quantum theory published in 1935. Two letters written by Cooper, and the replies from Einstein, all written between October and December 1949, are retyped from the original ones. Furthermore, Einstein's second letter, which he wrote in German, is translated into English. The lack of agreement, arising from very different points of view, is analysed, taking into account the complex underlying mathematical and physical factors that arise naturally in connection with the EPR paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12152v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a reinforcement learning (RL) based control framework for optimizing evaporative cooling in the preparation of strongly interacting degenerate Fermi gases of Li6. Using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the system autonomously explores a high-dimensional parameter space to learn optimal cooling trajectories. Compared to conventional exponential ramps, our method achieves up to 130% improvement in atomic density within a 0.5 second, revealing non-trivial control strategies that balance fast evaporation and thermalization. While our current optimization focuses on the evaporation stage, future integration of other cooling stages, such as grey molasses cooling, could further extend RL to the full preparation pipeline. Our result highlights the promise of RL as a general tool for closed-loop quantum control and automated calibration in complex atomic physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine van der Waals repulsion between open-shell polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel type of interaction between open-shell polar molecules at sub-millikelvin temperatures. This hyperfine van der Waals interaction occurs between two molecules in two rotational states that differ by one quantum. Normally, this induces resonant dipolar interactions that lead to rapid collisional loss. For specific hyperfine states, however, selection rules prevent this. One can effectively turn off the dipolar interaction by merely flipping a nuclear spin. The resulting van der Waals interaction can be repulsive and can suppress collisional loss. We focus on laser-coolable CaF, but show this effect occurs universally for open-shell molecules, including MgF, SrF, BaF and YO. We propose that this effect could be measured by merging molecules in optical tweezers, where flipping a spin in one of the tweezers enables tuning of collision rates by five orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers promise to outperform their classical counterparts at certain tasks. However, existing quantum devices are error-prone and restricted in size. Thus, effective compilation methods are crucial to exploit limited quantum resources. In this work, we address the problem of qubit routing for commuting gates, which arises, for example, during the compilation of the well-known Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. We propose a two-step decomposition approach based on integer programming, which is guaranteed to return an optimal solution. To justify the use of integer programming, we prove NP-hardness of the underlying optimization problem. Furthermore, we derive asymptotic upper and lower bounds on the quality of a solution. We develop several integer programming models and derive linear descriptions of related polytopes, which generalize to applications beyond this work. Finally, we conduct a computational study showing that our approach outperforms existing heuristics in terms of quality and exact methods in terms of runtime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how well future cosmological experiments can reconstruct the mechanism that generated primordial inhomogeneities is key to assessing the extent to which cosmology can inform fundamental physics. In this work, we apply a quantum metrology tool - the quantum Fisher information - to the squeezed quantum state describing cosmological perturbations at the end of inflation. This quantifies the ultimate precision achievable in parameter estimation, assuming ideal access to early-universe information. By comparing the quantum Fisher information to its classical counterpart - derived from measurements of the curvature perturbation power spectrum alone (homodyne measurement) - we evaluate how close current observations come to this quantum limit. Focusing on the tensor-to-scalar ratio as a case study, we find that the gap between classical and quantum Fisher information grows exponentially with the number of e-folds a mode spends outside the horizon. This suggests the existence of a highly efficient (but presently inaccessible) optimal measurement. Conversely, we show that accessing the decaying mode of inflationary perturbations is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for exponentially improving the inference of the tensor-to-scalar ratio.</description>

      <title>Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum squeezed states enable precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit, but conventional solid-state media fundamentally limit pump intensities to the ionization threshold. We demonstrate that plasma waves can mediate ultra-strong two-mode squeezing through stimulated Raman scattering, achieving up to ultrastrong squeezing using $10^{16}{Wcm^{-2}}$ pump lasers. Employing two copropagating pump beams with frequency difference matching twice the plasma frequency, we generate quantum-correlated photon pairs through phonon-mediated four-wave mixing. The process exhibits remarkable thermal noise tolerance, allowing strong squeezing even with large thermal phonon numbers. This plasma-based approach produces squeezed states with ultrahigh photon numbers, opening new possibilities for strong-field applications across optical to X-ray wavelengths.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a 2D graphene structure containing atomic ensemble as a platform for implementing nanoscale enhanced coherent interactions of plasmonic fields with resonant atomic systems. We determine the graphene surface plasmon modes, and the properties of its electromagnetic fields, and emphasize the role of graphene sheet separation on the interaction with atomic systems for various dipole orientations and positions between the graphene sheets. We analyze the conditions for implementation of coherent interaction of SP mode with resonant atomic ensembles. By solving the Maxwell-Bloch equations that govern the resonant interaction of surface plasmons with atoms, we derive the modified area theorem, which makes it possible to identify the most common nonlinear patterns in the behavior of plasmons under the studied conditions. We obtain analytical and numerical solutions of the area theorem, and find the possibility of stable propagation of isolated SP pulses of graphene surface plasmon modes at "fractional" pulse area values relative to $\pi$. We show that the coherent dynamics of SP fields can be realized in nanoscale design and we highlight the possibilities of using this scheme of coherent dynamics for implementing compact multimode nanoscale quantum memory and its integration with other quantum devices on the proposed platform.</description>

      <title>On One-Shot Signatures, Quantum vs Classical Binding, and Obfuscating Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-shot signatures (OSS) were defined by Amos, Georgiou, Kiayias, and Zhandry (STOC'20). These allow for signing exactly one message, after which the signing key self-destructs, preventing a second message from ever being signed. While such an object is impossible classically, Amos et al observe that OSS may be possible using quantum signing keys by leveraging the no-cloning principle. OSS has since become an important conceptual tool with many applications in decentralized settings and for quantum cryptography with classical communication. OSS are also closely related to separations between classical-binding and collapse-binding for post-quantum hashing and commitments. Unfortunately, the only known OSS construction due to Amos et al. was only justified in a classical oracle model, and moreover their justification was ultimately found to contain a fatal bug. Thus, the existence of OSS, even in a classical idealized model, has remained open.
  We give the first standard-model OSS, with provable security assuming (sub-exponential) indistinguishability obfuscation (iO) and LWE. This also gives the first standard-model separation between classical and collapse-binding post-quantum commitments/hashing, solving a decade-old open problem. Along the way, we also give the first construction with unconditional security relative to a classical oracle. To achieve our standard-model construction, we develop a notion of permutable pseudorandom permutations (permutable PRPs), and show how they are useful for translating oracle proofs involving random permutations into obfuscation-based proofs. In particular, obfuscating permutable PRPs gives a trapdoor one-way permutation that is \emph{full-domain}, solving another decade-old-problem of constructing this object from (sub-exponential) iO and one-way functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10509v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a quantum-inspired tensor network algorithm for solving tridiagonal Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems and quadratic unconstrained discrete optimization (QUDO) problems. We also solve the more general Tensor quadratic unconstrained discrete optimization (T-QUDO) problems with one-neighbor interactions in a lineal chain. This method provides an exact and explicit equation for these problems. Our algorithms are based on the simulation of a state that undergoes imaginary time evolution and a Half partial trace. In addition, we address the degenerate case and evaluate the polynomial complexity of the algorithm, also providing a parallelized version. We implemented and tested them with other well-known classical algorithms and observed an improvement in the quality of the results. The performance of the proposed algorithms is compared with the Google OR-TOOLS and dimod solvers, improving their results.</description>

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a powerful tool for solving and approximating combinatorial optimization problems such as graph partitioning, community detection, centrality, routing problems, and more. In this paper we explore the use of quantum annealing as a tool for use in exploring combinatorial mathematics research problems. We consider the monochromatic triangle problem and the Ramsey number problem, both examples of graph coloring. Conversion to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) form is required to run on quantum hardware. While the monochromatic triangle problem is quadratic by nature, the Ramsey number problem requires the use of order reduction methods for a quadratic formulation. We discuss implementations, limitations, and results when running on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic quantum states (non-stabilizer states) play a pivotal role in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Simultaneously, random resources have emerged as a key element in various randomized techniques within contemporary quantum science. In this study, we establish a direct connection between these two notions. More specifically, our research demonstrates that when a subsystem of a quantum state is measured, the resultant unmeasured part of the system can exhibit a high degree of randomness that can be enhanced by the inherent correlations of the underlying magic quantum state. Our findings suggest an approach to quantifying correlations within magic quantum states beyond the conventional paradigm of entanglement, and introduce an efficient approach for leveraging such correlations to generate random quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Dictionary-based Block Encoding of Sparse Matrices with Low Subnormalization and Circuit Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18007v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Block encoding severs as an important data input model in quantum algorithms, enabling quantum computers to simulate non-unitary operators effectively. In this paper, we propose an efficient block-encoding protocol for sparse matrices based on a novel data structure, called the dictionary data structure, which classifies all non-zero elements according to their values and indices. Non-zero elements with the same values, lacking common column and row indices, belong to the same classification in our block-encoding protocol's dictionary. When compiled into the \{\rm U(2), CNOT\} gate set, the protocol queries a $2^n \times 2^n$ sparse matrix with $s$ non-zero elements at a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(\log(ns))$, utilizing $\mathcal{O}(n^2s)$ ancillary qubits. This offers an exponential improvement in circuit depth relative to the number of system qubits, compared to existing methods~\cite{clader2022quantum,zhang2024circuit} with a circuit depth of $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Moreover, in our protocol, the subnormalization, a scaled factor that influences the measurement probability of ancillary qubits, is minimized to $\sum_{l=0}^{s_0}\vert A_l\vert$, where $s_0$ denotes the number of classifications in the dictionary and $A_l$ represents the value of the $l$-th classification. Furthermore, we show that our protocol connects to linear combinations of unitaries (LCU) and the sparse access input model (SAIM). To demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, we provide several applications, including Laplacian matrices in graph problems and discrete differential operators.</description>

      <title>On-chip microwave coherent source with in-situ control of the photon number distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent photon sources are key elements in different applications, ranging from quantum sensing to quantum computing. The possibility of designing and engineering superconducting circuits behaving like artificial atoms supports the realization of quantum optics protocols, including microwave photons generation. Here we propose and theoretically investigate a design that allows a tunable photon injection directly on-chip. Our approach enables control of the emission via an external knob while preserving, in principle, the stability and linewidth characteristics. This is achieved by replacing the conventional capacitive link between the source and the reservoir with a tunable coupler, with the advantage of avoiding direct dynamical manipulation of the photon source dynamics, providing pulsed control of the emission. We validate the dynamical control of the generated state under the effect of an external flux threading the tunable coupler and discuss the possibility of employing this scheme also in the context of multiple bosonic reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Certifying nonlocal properties of noisy quantum operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying quantum properties from the probability distributions they induce is an important task for several purposes. While this framework has been largely explored and used for quantum states, its extrapolation to the level of channels started recently in a variety of approaches. In particular, little is known about to what extent noise can spoil certification methods for channels. In this work we provide a unified methodology to certify nonlocal properties of quantum channels from the correlations obtained in prepare-and-measurement protocols: our approach gathers fully and semi-device-independent existing methods for this purpose, and extends them to new certification criteria. In addition, the effect of different models of dephasing noise is analysed. Some noise models are shown to generate nonlocality and entanglement in special cases. In the extreme case of complete dephasing, the measurement protocols discussed yield particularly simple tests to certify nonlocality, which can be obtained from known criteria by fixing the dephasing basis. These are based on the relations between bipartite quantum channels and their classical analogues: bipartite stochastic matrices defining conditional distributions.</description>

      <title>A single-photon microwave switch with recoverable control photon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable quantum technologies may be applied in prospective architectures employing traditional information processing elements, such as transistors, rectifiers, or switches modulated by low-power inputs. In this respect, recently developed quantum processors based, e.g., on superconducting circuits may alternatively be employed as the basic platform for ultra-low-power consumption classical processors, in addition to obvious applications in quantum information processing and quantum computing. Here we propose a single-photon microwave switch based on a circuit quantum electrodynamics setup, in which a single control photon in a transmission line is able to switch on/off the propagation of another single photon in a separate line. The performances of this single-photon switch are quantified in terms of the photon flux through the output channel, providing a direct comparison of our results with available data. Furthermore, we show how the design of this microwave switch enables the recovery of the single control photon after the switching process. This proposal may be readily realized in state-of-art superconducting circuit technology.</description>

Abstract: The distance of a stabilizer quantum code is a very important feature since it determines the number of errors that can be detected and corrected. We present three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the symplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are based on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that these new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art licensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and shared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the performance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of magnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on shared-memory parallel architectures.</description>

      <title>Noisy Probabilistic Error Cancellation and Generalized Physical Implementability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoherence severely limits the performance of quantum processors, posing challenges to reliable quantum computation. Probabilistic error cancellation, a quantum error mitigation method, counteracts noise by quasiprobabilistically simulating (non-physical) inverse noise operations. However, existing formulations of physical implementability, quantifying the minimal cost of simulating non-physical operations using physical channels, do not fully account for the experimental constraints, since noise also affects the cancellation process and not all physical channels are experimentally accessible. Here, we generalize the physical implementability to encompass arbitrary convex sets of experimentally available quantum states and operations. Within this generalized framework, we demonstrate noiseless error cancellation with noisy Pauli operations and analyze the bias of noisy cancellation. Furthermore, we establish connections between generalized physical implementability and quantum information measures, e.g., diamond norm, logarithmic negativity, and purity. These findings enhance the practical applicability of probabilistic error cancellation and open new avenues for robust quantum information processing and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The Cram\'{e}r-Rao approach and global quantum estimation of bosonic states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11842v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state estimation is a fundamental task in quantum information theory, where one estimates real parameters continuously embedded in a family of quantum states. In the theory of quantum state estimation, the widely used Cram\'er Rao approach which considers local estimation gives the ultimate precision bound of quantum state estimation in terms of the quantum Fisher information. However practical scenarios need not offer much prior information about the parameters to be estimated, and the local estimation setting need not apply. In general, it is unclear whether the Cram\'er-Rao approach is applicable for global estimation instead of local estimation. In this paper, we find situations where the Cram\'er-Rao approach does and does not work for quantum state estimation problems involving a family of bosonic states in a non-IID setting, where we only use one copy of the bosonic quantum state in the large number of bosons setting. Our result highlights the importance of caution when using the results of the Cram\'er-Rao approach to extrapolate to the global estimation setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Parameter-shift Rule: Enabling Gradient Computation for Photonic Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for gradient computation in quantum algorithms implemented on linear optical quantum computing platforms. While parameter-shift rules have become a staple in qubit gate-based quantum computing for calculating gradients, their direct application to photonic platforms has been hindered by the non-unitary nature of differentiated phase-shift operators in Fock space. We introduce a photonic parameter-shift rule that overcomes this limitation, providing an exact formula for gradient computation in linear optical quantum processors. Our method scales linearly with the number of input photons and utilizes the same parameterized photonic circuit with shifted parameters for each evaluation. This advancement bridges a crucial gap in photonic quantum computing, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization for variational quantum algorithms on near-term photonic quantum processors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical simulations in quantum chemistry and generative modeling tasks, showing superior optimization performance as well as robustness to noise from finite sampling and photon distinguishability compared to other gradient-based and gradient-free methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of electrons and other fermionic particles in quantum chemistry, materials science, and high-energy physics is one of the most promising applications of fault-tolerant quantum computers. However, the overhead in mapping time evolution under fermionic Hamiltonians to qubit gates renders this endeavor challenging. We introduce fermionic fault-tolerant quantum computing, a framework which removes this overhead altogether. Using native fermionic operations we first construct a repetition code which corrects phase errors only. Within a fermionic color code, which corrects for both phase and loss errors, we then realize a universal fermionic gate set, including transversal fermionic Clifford gates. Interfacing with qubit color codes we introduce qubit-fermion fault-tolerant computation, which allows for qubit-controlled fermionic time evolution, a crucial subroutine in state-of-the-art quantum algorithms. As an application, we consider simulating crystalline materials, finding an exponential improvement in circuit depth for a single time step from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log(N))$ with respect to lattice site number $N$ while retaining a site count of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(N)$, implying a linear-in-$N$ end-to-end gate depth for simulating materials, as opposed to quadratic in previous approaches. We also introduce a fermion-inspired qubit algorithm with $O(\mathrm{log}(N)$ depth, but a prohibitive number of additional ancilla qubits. We show how our framework can be implemented in neutral atoms, overcoming the apparent inability of neutral atoms to implement non-number-conserving gates. Our work opens the door to fermion-qubit fault-tolerant quantum computation in platforms with native fermions such as neutral atoms, quantum dots and donors in silicon, with applications in quantum chemistry, material science, and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Towards Variational Quantum Algorithms for generalized linear and nonlinear transport phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a Variational Quantum Algorithm to solve linear and nonlinear thermofluid dynamic transport equations. The hybrid classical-quantum framework is applied to problems governed by the heat, wave, and Burgers' equation in combination with different engineering boundary conditions. Topics covered include the encoding of band matrices, as in the consideration of non-constant material properties and upwind-biased first- and higher-order approximations, widely used in engineering Computational Fluid Dynamics, by the use of a mask function. Verification examples demonstrate high predictive agreement with classical methods. Furthermore, the scalability analysis shows a polylog scaling of the number of quantum gates with the number of qubits. Remaining challenges refer to the implicit construction of upwind schemes and the identification of an appropriate parameterization strategy of the quantum ansatz.</description>

      <title>A deep neural network approach to solve the Dirac equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the method from [Naito, Naito, and Hashimoto, Phys. Rev. Research 5, 033189 (2023)] to solve the Dirac equation not only for the ground state but also for low-lying excited states using a deep neural network and the unsupervised machine learning technique. The variational method fails because of the Dirac sea, which is avoided by introducing the inverse Hamiltonian method. For low-lying excited states, two methods are proposed, which have different performances and advantages. The validity of this method is verified by the calculations with the Coulomb and Woods-Saxon potentials.</description>

      <title>Reliable quantum advantage in quantum battery charging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum batteries represent one of the most promising applications of quantum thermodynamics, whose goal is not only to store energy inside small quantum systems but also to potentially leverage genuine quantum effects to outperform classical counterparts. In this context, however, energy fluctuations become extremely relevant and have a significant impact on the charging efficiency. In our work, we consider a simple yet paradigmatic model in which a flying qubit (the battery) coherently interacts with a single mode optical cavity (the charger) through a number conserving Jaynes-Cummings interaction. By making use of full-counting statistics techniques, we fully characterize the average charging power, its fluctuations and the associated charging efficiency for several different choices of initial states of the optical cavity, demonstrating that preparing the latter in a genuinely quantum non-Gaussian Fock state (rather than a classical or even non-classical Gaussian state) leads to a definite and (in principle) measurable advantage in all these figures of merit.</description>

      <title>No-Go Theorem for Generic Simulation of Qubit Channels with Finite Classical Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mathematical framework of quantum theory, though fundamentally distinct from classical physics, raises the question of whether quantum processes can be efficiently simulated using classical resources. For instance, a sender (Alice) possessing the classical description of a qubit state can simulate the action of a qubit channel through finite classical communication with a receiver (Bob), enabling Bob to reproduce measurement statistics for any observable on the state. In this work, we contend that a more general simulation requires reproducing statistics of joint measurements, potentially involving entangled effects, on Alice's system and an additional system held by Bob, even when Bob's system state is unknown or entangled with a larger system. Within this broad framework, we prove that no finite amount of classical messaging, regardless of how many rounds are used or how large each message can be, can reproduce a perfect qubit channel, highlighting an inescapable barrier in quantum channel simulation with classical resources. We also establish that entangled effects crucially underlies this no-go result. However, for noisy qubit channels, such as those with depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that general simulation is achievable with finite communication. Notably, the required communication increases as the noise decreases, revealing an intricate relationship between the noise in the channel and the resources necessary for its classical simulation.</description>

      <title>Impulse measurements enhanced with squeezed readout light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify how squeezed light can reduce quantum measurement noise to levels below the standard quantum limit in impulse measurements with mechanical detectors. The broadband nature of the signal implies that frequency-dependent squeezing performs better than frequency-independent squeezing. We calculate the optimal scaling of the impulse sensitivity with the squeezing strength, and quantify degradations due to photodetection losses. Even for lossless measurement, we find there exists a fundamental limit to the benefit of squeezing that depends only on the system's mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>A Linearly Convergent Algorithm for Computing the Petz-Augustin Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computation of the Petz-Augustin mean of order $\alpha \in (0,1) \cup (1,\infty)$, defined as the minimizer of a weighted sum of $n$ Petz-R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha$ over the set of $d$-by-$d$ quantum states, where the Petz-R\'enyi divergence is a quantum generalization of the classical R\'enyi divergence. We propose the first algorithm with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for solving this optimization problem. The iterates are guaranteed to converge to the Petz-Augustin mean at a linear rate of \( O\left( \lvert 1 - 1/\alpha \rvert^T \right) \) with respect to the Thompson metric for $\alpha\in(1/2,1)\cup(1,\infty)$, where \( T \) denotes the number of iterations. The algorithm has an initialization time complexity of $O\left(nd^3\right)$ and a per-iteration time complexity of $O\left(nd^2 + d^3\right)$.
  Two applications follow. First, we propose the first iterative method with a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for computing the Petz capacity of order $\alpha\in(1/2,1)$, which generalizes the quantum channel capacity and characterizes the optimal error exponent in classical-quantum channel coding. Second, we establish that the Petz-Augustin mean of order $\alpha$, when all quantum states commute, is equivalent to the equilibrium prices in Fisher markets with constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utilities of common elasticity $\rho=1-1/\alpha$, and our proposed algorithm can be interpreted as a t\^{a}tonnement dynamic. We then extend the proposed algorithm to inhomogeneous Fisher markets, where buyers have different elasticities, and prove that it achieves a faster convergence rate compared to existing t\^{a}tonnement-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning assisted non-reciprocal optomechanical gyroscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel optomechanical gyroscope architecture based on a spinning cavity optomechanical resonator (COM) evanescently coupled to a tapered optical fiber without relying on costly quantum light sources. Our study reveals a striking dependence of the gyroscope's sensitivity on the propagation direction of the driving optical field, manifesting robust quantum non-reciprocal behavior. This non-reciprocity significantly enhances the precision of angular velocity estimation, offering a unique advantage over conventional gyroscopic systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the operational range of this non-reciprocal gyroscope is fundamentally governed by the frequency of the pumping optical field, enabling localized sensitivity to angular velocity. Leveraging the adaptive capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL), we optimize the gyroscope's sensitivity within a targeted angular velocity range, achieving unprecedented levels of precision. These results highlight the transformative potential of RL in advancing high-resolution, miniaturized optomechanical gyroscopes, opening new avenues for next-generation inertial sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Are Molecules Magical? Non-Stabilizerness in Molecular Bonding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Isolated atoms as well as molecules at equilibrium are presumed to be simple from the point of view of quantum computational complexity. Here we show that the process of chemical bond formation is accompanied by a marked increase in the quantum complexity of the electronic ground state. By studying the hydrogen dimer H$_{2}$ as a prototypical example, we demonstrate that when two hydrogen atoms form a bond, a specific measure of quantum complexity exhibits a pronounced peak that closely follows the behavior of the binding energy. This measure of quantum complexity, known as magic in the quantum information literature, reflects how difficult it is to simulate the state using classical methods. This observation suggests that regions of strong bonding formation or breaking are also regions of enhanced intrinsic quantum complexity. This insight suggests a connection of quantum information measures to chemical reactivity and advocates the use of stretched molecules as a quantum computational resource.</description>

      <title>Accelerating MCMC with Quantum Walks: Design, Implementation, and Results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are algorithms for sampling probability distributions, often applied to the Boltzmann distribution in physical and chemical models, such as protein folding and the Ising model. These methods enable the study of such systems by sampling their most probable states. However, sampling multidimensional and multimodal distributions with MCMC demands significant computational resources, leading to the development of techniques aimed at improving sampling efficiency. In this context, quantum computing, with its potential to accelerate classical methods, emerges as a promising solution to the sampling problem. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a novel MCMC algorithm (QMCMC) based on the Discrete Quantum Walk (DQW) algorithm. We test several Gaussian distributions, including mixtures and demonstrate that it effectively captures the structure of the target distribution by leveraging quantum superposition. In addition, we introduce a circuit extension that significantly improves convergence speed, which in turn enhances the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained dynamics of entanglement in non-integrable quenches far across the Ising quantum critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of exploring and understanding various aspects of far-from-equilibrium dynamics of closed and generic quantum many-body systems has received a thrust of attention in recent years, driven partly by remarkable advances in ultracold experimental technologies. In this work, for the paradigmatic Ising spin chain with transverse and longitudinal fields and partly motivated by the practice of site-resolved control in contemporary ultracold experiments, we present numerical observations of several $\textit{fine-grained}$ (small-subsystem level) features of far-from-equilibrium dynamics from a quantum informational point of view, induced by quantum quenches far across the Ising critical point between states deep inside the para- and ferro-magnetic regimes. Rather featureless dynamics is seen for ferromagnetic to paramagnetic quenches, but paramagnetic to ferromagnetic quenches exhibit rich behaviour, including recurrences of an approximately Page-like dynamics of entanglement entropies of one- and two-spin subsystems, periodic but short-lived occurrences of approximately $1-$uniform states, a series of sudden deaths and revivals of entanglement between two spins in the system's bulk, non-analytic cusps in single-copy entanglement entropy for three-spin and bigger subsystems, insufficient mixedness and a series of scrambling-$\textit{un}$scrambling of local mutual information between neighboring spins. Moreover, essentially indistinguishable dynamics is seen at very early times between the integrable limit (zero longitudinal field) and non-integrable cases, with the former eventually showing signatures of better mixing and faster approach to equilibration than the latter. These features are expected to hold for quench dynamics across Ising quantum critical points in more complicated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum magic, which accounts for the non-stabilizer content of a state, is essential for universal quantum computation beyond classically simulable resources. We investigate the generation and evolution of quantum magic in discrete-time quantum walks (DTQWs) using the Stabilizer Renyi Entropy as a measure of quantum magic. We investigate single- and two-walker quantum walks on a one-dimensional lattice, considering a wide range of initial coin states. Our results reveal that DTQWs can dynamically generate significant magic, with the amount and structure strongly dependent on the initial state of the coin. In the case of a single walker, the relationship between magic and entanglement is found to be nontrivial and complementary at long times. These findings position DTQWs as accessible and controllable platforms for producing quantum magic, offering a new perspective on their role in quantum information processing and reliable quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The verification of quantum entanglement is essential for quality control in quantum communication. In this work, we propose an efficient protocol to directly verify the two-qubit entanglement of a known target state through a single expectation value measurement. Our method provides exact entanglement quantification using the currencence measure without performing quantum state tomography. We prove the existence of a unitary transformation that drives the initial state of a two-qubit system to a designated final state, where the trace over a chosen observable directly yields the concurrence of the initial state. Furthermore, we implement an optimal control process of that transformation and demonstrate its effectiveness through numerical simulations. We also show that this process is robust to environmental noise. Our approach offers advantages in directly verifying entanglement with low circuit depth, making it suitable for industrial-scale quality control of entanglement generation. Our results, presented here, provide mathematical justification for our earlier computational experiments.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of the DEJMPS purification protocol in noisy entangled photon systems, a Monte Carlo simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement purification is a critical enabling technology for quantum communication, allowing high-fidelity entangled pairs to be distilled from noisy resources. We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo study of the DEJMPS purification protocol applied to polarization-entangled photon pairs subject to both amplitude-damping noise (gamma) and dephasing noise (p). By sweeping (gamma, p) over a two-dimensional grid and performing repeated stochastic trials, we map out the average fidelity and average yield surfaces of the purified output, as well as the net gains (DF) and losses (DY) relative to the unpurified baseline. Our results show that a single round of DEJMPS purification can boost entanglement fidelity by up to 0.07 in high-noise regimes, while incurring a yield penalty of up to 0.55. Fidelity gains grow monotonically with both gamma and p, whereas yields decline more sharply under combined noise. Contour and 3D surface plots of DF(gamma, p) and (DY, gamma, p) vividly illustrate the trade-off between quality and quantity of distilled pairs. This two-parameter Monte Carlo characterization provides practical guidance for optimizing purification depth and operating points in real-world photonic networks, and represents, to our knowledge, the first detailed numerical charting of both fidelity and yield improvements across a continuous noise landscape for DEJMPS.</description>

Abstract: As hybrid quantum-classical models gain traction in machine learning, there is a growing need for tools that assess their effectiveness beyond raw accuracy. We present QMetric, a Python package offering a suite of interpretable metrics to evaluate quantum circuit expressibility, feature representations, and training dynamics. QMetric quantifies key aspects such as circuit fidelity, entanglement entropy, barren plateau risk, and training stability. The package integrates with Qiskit and PyTorch, and is demonstrated via a case study on binary MNIST classification comparing classical and quantum-enhanced models. Code, plots, and a reproducible environment are available on GitLab.</description>

      <title>Quantum Singular Value Transformation for Solving the Time-Dependent Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09686v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an 21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$, enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$ observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems of equations, and they point to the need for the development of measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Compilation of QCrank Encoding Algorithm for a Dynamically Programmable Qubit Array Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithm and hardware-aware compilation co-design is essential for the efficient deployment of near-term quantum programs. We present a compilation case-study implementing QCrank -- an efficient encoding protocol for storing sequenced real-valued classical data in a quantum state -- targeting neutral atom-based Dynamically Programmable Qubit Arrays (DPQAs). We show how key features of neutral-atom arrays such as high qubits count, operation parallelism, multi-zone architecture, and natively reconfigurable connectivity can be used to inform effective algorithm deployment. We identify algorithmic and circuit features that signal opportunities to implement them in a hardware-efficient manner. To evaluate projected hardware performance, we define a realistic noise model for DPQAs using parameterized Pauli channels, implement it in Qiskit circuit simulators, and assess QCrank's accuracy for writing and reading back 24-320 real numbers into 6-20 qubits. We compare DPQA results with simulated performances of Quantinuum's H1-1E and with experimental results from IBM Fez, highlighting promising accuracy scaling for DPQAs.</description>

      <title>Sharp Error-Rate Transitions in Quantum QC-LDPC Codes under Joint BP Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we report that quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes decoded via joint belief propagation (BP) exhibit steep error-rate curves, despite the presence of error floors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such threshold-like behavior for quantum LDPC codes with non-vanishing coding rate, excluding those decoded with non-binary BP decoders. Moreover, we find that dominant error events contributing to the error floor typically involve only a small number of bits. These findings suggest that the error floor is caused by trapping sets--specific subgraph structures in the Tanner graph--and indicate that identifying and avoiding such structures may lead to further reduction of the error floor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum eigenstate of a classically chaotic system is referred as scarred by an unstable periodic orbit if its probability density is concentrated in the vicinity of that orbit. Recently, a new class of scarring - variational scarring - was discovered in numerical studies of disordered quantum dots, arising from near-degeneracies in the quantum spectrum associated with classical resonances of the unperturbed system. Despite the increasing body of theoretical evidence on variational scarring, its experimental observation has remained out of reach. Motivated by this dearth, we argue and demonstrate that variational scarring can occur in an elliptical quantum dot fabricated on monolayer graphene, and locally perturbed by a nanotip. Then, we further show that the fingerprint of these variational scars can potentially be detected via scanning tunneling microscopy, thus offering an attractive experimental pathway for the first validation of this puzzling quantum-chaotic phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A Practical Quantum Hoare Logic with Classical Variables, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a Hoare-style logic for reasoning about quantum programs with classical variables. Our approach offers several improvements over previous work:
  (1) Enhanced expressivity of the programming language: Our logic applies to quantum programs with classical variables that incorporate quantum arrays and parameterised quantum gates, which have not been addressed in previous research on quantum Hoare logic, either with or without classical variables.
  (2) Intuitive correctness specifications: In our logic, preconditions and postconditions for quantum programs with classical variables are specified as a pair consisting of a classical first-order logical formula and a quantum predicate formula (possibly parameterised by classical variables). These specifications offer greater clarity and align more closely with the programmer's intuitive understanding of quantum and classical interactions.
  (3) Simplified proof system: By introducing a novel idea in formulating a proof rule for reasoning about quantum measurements, along with (2), we develop a proof system for quantum programs that requires only minimal modifications to classical Hoare logic. Furthermore, this proof system can be effectively and conveniently combined with classical first-order logic to verify quantum programs with classical variables.
  As a result, the learning curve for quantum program verification techniques is significantly reduced for those already familiar with classical program verification techniques, and existing tools for verifying classical programs can be more easily adapted for quantum program verification.</description>

      <title>Entanglement induced by Heisenberg exchange between an electron in a nested quantum dot and a qubit with relative motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nested quantum dot structure for improved control of entanglement induced by the Heisenberg exchange between an electron and a qubit with relative motion. The entanglement is quantified by the mutual information (MI). The electron, initially prepared in the ground state, generally produces greater entanglement when excited to the scattering state compared to remaining in the bound state. In the bound state, the final entanglement oscillates as a function of the qubit speed and can be tuned accordingly. In the case of long-range interaction, the normalized exchange distribution leads to substantial final entanglement, independent of the qubit moving direction, indicating that even very weak but prolonged exchange can still generate significant entanglement. In the case of short-range interaction, different moving directions lead to varying MI values. We also consider the scenario without the nested dot and find that the same maximum (among all times) MI is pre-determined solely by the initial angle between the spins. In this case, the entanglement exhibits different growth characteristics during different phases. The saturation of the MI mimics that of a strict zero-dimensional quantum dot, where exchange and time are combined into a single parameter, the amount of interaction.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.</description>

      <title>Limitations of the paraxial beam model in the study of quantum vacuum signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studies of nonlinear quantum vacuum signals often model the driving laser fields as paraxial beams. This in particular holds for analytic approaches. While this allows for reliable predictions in most situations, there are also notable exceptions. A prominent example is the overestimation of the polarization-flipped signal photon yield in the collision of two equally focused, parallel polarized laser beams by a factor of about six. In the present work, we identify the origin of this deficiency and devise a strategy to obtain accurate closed-form expressions also in cases challenging the conventional (leading order) paraxial beam model. We demonstrate the potential of our approach on the example of two linearly polarized laser pulses colliding at a generic collision angle.</description>

      <title>Calculation of low-energy scattering parameters using artificial oscillator trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a recipe to estimate the low-energy scattering parameters of a quantum few-body system - scattering length, effective range, and shape parameter - by using only discrete state calculations. We place the system in an artificial oscillator trap of appropriate size and calculate the energies of the resulting discrete states close to the threshold of the system. The low-energy scattering parameters are then extracted - using a simple analytic formula - from the functional dependence of these energies upon the trap size. We first test the recipe against a simple model problem and then apply it to low-energy nucleon-nucleon scattering within the nuclear Model with Explicit Mesons in one sigma-meson approximation.</description>

      <title>Engineering nonlinear activation functions for all-optical neural networks via quantum interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: All-optical neural networks (AONNs) promise transformative gains in speed and energy efficiency for artificial intelligence (AI) by leveraging the intrinsic parallelism and wave nature of light. However, their scalability has been fundamentally limited by the high power requirements of conventional nonlinear optical elements. Here, we present a low-power nonlinear activation scheme based on a three-level quantum system driven by dual laser fields. This platform introduces a two-channel nonlinear activation matrix with both self- and cross-nonlinearities, enabling true multi-input, multi-output optical processing. The system supports tunable activation behaviors, including sigmoid and ReLU functions, at ultralow power levels (17 uW per neuron). We validate our approach through theoretical modeling and experimental demonstration in rubidium vapor cells, showing the feasibility of scaling to deep AONNs with millions of neurons operating under 20 W of total optical power. Crucially, we also demonstrate the all-optical generation of gradient-like signals with backpropagation, paving the way for all optical training. These results mark a major advance toward scalable, high-speed, and energy-efficient optical AI hardware.</description>

      <title>Entanglement features from heavy particle scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amount of information propagated by intermediate heavy particles exhibits characteristic features in inelastic scatterings with $n\geq 3$ final particles. As the total energy increases, the entanglement entropy, between its decay products and other final particles, exhibits a universal sharp dip, suppressed by its small decay rate. This indicates an entanglement suppression from a low-energy effective theory to a channel dominated by an on-shell heavy particle. As demonstrations of these entanglement features, we study concrete models of $2\to 3$ and $2\to 4$ scatterings, which shed light on the entanglement structure beyond the area law derived for $2\to 2$ scattering. In practice, these features may be probed by suitably marginalizing the phase-space distribution of final particles.</description>

      <title>Entropy from decoherence: a case study using glasma-based occupation numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the entropy-per-particle, $S/N$, produced by the decoherence of a coherent state interacting with an environment, using an analytical open quantum system approach. The coherent state considered is characterized by occupation numbers borrowed from the glasma fields produced in the early stages of high-energy nuclear collisions. The environment is modeled as the vacuum, and decoherence arises from the interaction of the state with vacuum fluctuations. We describe the system-environment interaction via a phase-damping model, which represents continuous measurements on the system without altering its energy or particle number. Starting from the occupation numbers typical of the Glasma in high-energy proton-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus collisions, we find that the final $S/N$ after decoherence is lower than that of a two-dimensional thermal bath of ultrarelativistic gluons, except for proton-nucleus collisions at small values of $g\mu$. Our results indicate that quantum decoherence alone does not generate sufficient entropy to transform the initial coherent state into a thermalized gluon bath.</description>
