      <title>An Electronic Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a custom printed circuit board (PCB) as a low-power and high-speed accelerator for NP-Hard graph problems. Based on the annealing principle, it uses an analog computing architecture of coupled nonlinear electronic oscillators. Using an energy-based representation of the input problem, the system is shown to naturally follow the gradient towards stable phase alignments that encode solutions. We introduce the motivational theory, give an overview of our detailed circuit design, simulations, and experiments, and provide insight on the emerging development of novel physics-based computing devices.</description>

      <title>Biochemical Computing Mode for Sequential Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the growing scholarly interest in the next-generation general-purpose computers. Various innovative computing modes have been proposed, such as optical, quantum phenomena, and DNA-based modes. Sequential logic circuits are a critical factor that enables these modes to function as general-purpose computers, given their essential role in facilitating continuous computation and memory storage through their ability to store states. However, compared to computability, it is often overlooked due to the difficulty of its implementation. In this paper, we first demonstrate sequential mapping, a crucial necessary condition for electronic computers to realize sequential logic circuits, and highlight this distinctive property of general-purpose computers in the context of logic gate circuits. To achieve computational functionalities comparable to those of electronic computers, we utilize the control effect of enzymes on enzymatic reactions to design a logic gate model that is composed of small molecules and driven by enzymes, subsequently propose a biochemical computing mode. Furthermore, we mathematically analyze the static and dynamic input-output properties of biochemical logic gate components and prove that the biochemical computing mode satisfies sequential mapping similar to electronic computers. When combined with the storage characteristics of NOT-AND gates, it can realize sequential logic circuits. The findings can serve as a theoretical foundation for developing general-purpose biochemical computers.</description>

      <title>Ovonic switches enable energy-efficient dendrite-like computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, dendrites within individual biological neurons, which were previously thought to generally perform information pooling and networking, have now been shown to express complex temporal dynamics, Boolean-like logic, arithmetic, signal discrimination, and edge detection for image and sound recognition. Mimicking this rich functional density could offer a powerful primitive for neuromorphic computing, which has sought to replace the aging digital computing paradigms using biological inspirations. Here, using electrically driven Ovonic threshold switching in Sb-Te-doped GeSe, we demonstrate a single two-terminal component capable of self-sustained dynamics and universal Boolean logic, in addition to XOR operations (which is traditionally thought to require a network of active components). We then employ logic-driven dynamics in a single component to detect and estimate the gradients of edges in images, a task that otherwise requires elaborate circuits. A network of Ovonic switches exhibits properties of a half adder and a full adder, in addition to discriminative logic accommodating inhibitory and excitatory signals. We show that this computational primitive is not only seemingly simpler, but also offers many orders of magnitude improved energy efficiency compared to prevailing digital solutions. As such, this work paves the path for potentially emulating dendrites for efficient post-digital neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Spiking Neural Networks in UWB Channel Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although existing deep learning-based Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) channel estimation methods achieve high accuracy, their computational intensity clashes sharply with the resource constraints of low-cost edge devices. Motivated by this, this letter explores the potential of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for this task and develops a fully unsupervised SNN solution. To enable a comprehensive performance analysis, we devise an extensive set of comparative strategies and evaluate them on a compelling public benchmark. Experimental results show that our unsupervised approach still attains 80% test accuracy, on par with several supervised deep learning-based strategies. Moreover, compared with complex deep learning methods, our SNN implementation is inherently suited to neuromorphic deployment and offers a drastic reduction in model complexity, bringing significant advantages for future neuromorphic practice.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Computers for Neural Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural quantum states efficiently represent many-body wavefunctions with neural networks, but the cost of Monte Carlo sampling limits their scaling to large system sizes. Here we address this challenge by combining sparse Boltzmann machine architectures with probabilistic computing hardware. We implement a probabilistic computer on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and use it as a fast sampler for energy-based neural quantum states. For the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model at criticality, we obtain accurate ground-state energies for lattices up to 80 $\times$ 80 (6400 spins) using a custom multi-FPGA cluster. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-sampling algorithm to train deep Boltzmann machines, replacing intractable marginalization with conditional sampling over auxiliary layers. This enables the training of sparse deep models and improves parameter efficiency relative to shallow networks. Using this algorithm, we train deep Boltzmann machines for a system with 35 $\times$ 35 (1225 spins). Together, these results demonstrate that probabilistic hardware can overcome the sampling bottleneck in variational simulation of quantum many-body systems, opening a path to larger system sizes and deeper variational architectures.</description>

      <title>Advances in Agentic AI: Back to the Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent convergence between Agentic AI and our field of Algorithmization, this paper seeks to restore conceptual clarity and provide a structured analytical framework for an increasingly fragmented discourse. First, (a) it examines the contemporary landscape and proposes precise definitions for the key notions involved, ranging from intelligence to Agentic AI. Second, (b) it reviews our prior body of work to contextualize the evolution of methodologies and technological advances developed over the past decade, highlighting their interdependencies and cumulative trajectory. Third, (c) by distinguishing Machine and Learning efforts within the field of Machine Learning (d) it introduces the first Machine in Machine Learning (M1) as the underlying platform enabling today's LLM-based Agentic AI, conceptualized as an extension of B2C information-retrieval user experiences now being repurposed for B2B transformation. Building on this distinction, (e) the white paper develops the notion of the second Machine in Machine Learning (M2) as the architectural prerequisite for holistic, production-grade B2B transformation, characterizing it as Strategies-based Agentic AI and grounding its definition in the structural barriers-to-entry that such systems must overcome to be operationally viable. Further, (f) it offers conceptual and technical insight into what appears to be the first fully realized implementation of an M2. Finally, drawing on the demonstrated accuracy of the two previous decades of professional and academic experience in developing the foundational architectures of Algorithmization, (g) it outlines a forward-looking research and transformation agenda for the coming two decades.</description>

      <title>Towards autonomous time-calibration of large quantum-dot devices: Detection, real-time feedback, and noise spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance and scalability of semiconductor quantum-dot (QD) qubits are limited by electrostatic drift and charge noise that shift operating points and destabilize qubit parameters. As systems expand to large one- and two-dimensional arrays, manual recalibration becomes impractical, creating a need for autonomous stabilization frameworks. Here, we introduce a method that uses the full network of charge-transition lines in repeatedly acquired double-quantum-dot charge stability diagrams (CSDs) as a multidimensional probe of the local electrostatic environment. By accurately tracking the motion of selected transitions in time, we detect voltage drifts, identify abrupt charge reconfigurations, and apply compensating updates to maintain stable operating conditions. We demonstrate our approach on a 10-QD device, showing robust stabilization and real-time diagnostic access to dot-specific noise processes. The high acquisition rate of radio-frequency reflectometry CSD measurements also enables time-domain noise spectroscopy, allowing the extraction of noise power spectral densities, the identification of two-level fluctuators, and the analysis of spatial noise correlations across the array. From our analysis, we find that the background noise at 100~$\mu$\si{\hertz} is dominated by drift with a power law of $1/f^2$, accompanied by a few dominant two-level fluctuators and an average linear correlation length of $(188 \pm 38)$~\si{\nano\meter} in the device. These capabilities form the basis of a scalable, autonomous calibration and characterization module for QD-based quantum processors, providing essential feedback for long-duration, high-fidelity qubit operations.</description>

      <title>Vital Signs Monitoring with mmWave OFDM JCAS System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless techniques for monitoring human vital signs, such as heart and breathing rates, offer a promising solution in the context of joint communication and sensing (JCAS) with applications in medicine, sports, safety, security, and even the military. This paper reports experimental results obtained at the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Ilmenau, demonstrating the effectiveness of an indoor orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) JCAS system for detecting human heart and breathing rates. The system operated in a bistatic configuration at an FR2 frequency of 26.5 GHz with a variable bandwidth of up to 1 GHz. Measurements were taken under various scenarios, including a subject lying down, sitting, or walking, in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions, and with one or two subjects present simultaneously. The results indicate that while vital sign detection is generally feasible, its effectiveness is influenced by several factors, such as the subjects clothing, activity, as well as the distance and angle relative to the sensing system. In addition, no significant influence of bandwidth was detected since the vital signs information is encoded in the phase of the signal.</description>

      <title>Protonic Nickelate Device Networks for Spatiotemporal Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation in biological neural circuits arises from the interplay of nonlinear temporal responses and spatially distributed dynamic network interactions. Replicating this richness in hardware has remained challenging, as most neuromorphic devices emulate only isolated neuron- or synapse-like functions. In this work, we introduce an integrated neuromorphic computing platform in which both nonlinear spatiotemporal processing and programmable memory are realized within a single perovskite nickelate material system. By engineering symmetric and asymmetric hydrogenated NdNiO3 junction devices on the same wafer, we combine ultrafast, proton-mediated transient dynamics with stable multilevel resistance states. Networks of symmetric NdNiO3 junctions exhibit emergent spatial interactions mediated by proton redistribution, while each node simultaneously provides short-term temporal memory, enabling nanoseconds scale operation with an energy cost of 0.2 nJ per input. When interfaced with asymmetric output units serving as reconfigurable long-term weights, these networks allow both feature transformation and linear classification in the same material system. Leveraging these emergent interactions, the platform enables real-time pattern recognition and achieves high accuracy in spoken-digit classification and early seizure detection, outperforming temporal-only or uncoupled architectures. These results position protonic nickelates as a compact, energy-efficient, CMOS-compatible platform that integrates processing and memory for scalable intelligent hardware.</description>

      <title>One Step is Enough: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on One-Step Policy Optimization for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order dispatch is a critical task in ride-sharing systems with Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), directly influencing efficiency and profits. Recently, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a promising solution to this problem by decomposing the large state and action spaces among individual agents, effectively addressing the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) in transportation market, which is caused by the substantial number of vehicles, passengers, and orders. However, conventional MARL-based approaches heavily rely on accurate estimation of the value function, which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments. To address this issue, we propose two novel methods that bypass value function estimation, leveraging the homogeneous property of AV fleets. First, we draw an analogy between AV fleets and groups in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), adapting it to the order dispatch task. By replacing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline with the group average reward-to-go, GRPO eliminates critic estimation errors and reduces training bias. Inspired by this baseline replacement, we further propose One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO), demonstrating that the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step group rewards under a homogeneous fleet. Experiments on a real-world ride-hailing dataset show that both GRPO and OSPO achieve promising performance across all scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the number of served orders using simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) networks. Furthermore, OSPO outperforms GRPO in all scenarios, attributed to its elimination of bias caused by the bounded time horizon of GRPO. Our code, trained models, and processed data are provided at https://github.com/RS2002/OSPO .</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.</description>
