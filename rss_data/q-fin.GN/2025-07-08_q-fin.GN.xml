      <title>Economic Policy Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for categorizing economic policies in a form of a tree taxonomy. The purpose of this approach is to construct an exhaustive and standardized list of actions that a governing authority has access to and can change to control an economy. This is advantageous from two perspectives: by having an exhaustive list of tools, it becomes easier to construct "complete" models (i.e., models that take in all empirical data and aim to simulate economic dynamics) of an economy and understand what the assumptions of these models are; and by knowing all available actions, economic strategies can be devised that target specific economic performance metrics with an exhaustive list of policies.</description>

      <title>Piercing the Veil of TVL: DeFi Reappraised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11745v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Total value locked (TVL) is widely used to measure the size and popularity of decentralized finance (DeFi). However, TVL can be easily manipulated and inflated through "double counting" activities such as wrapping and leveraging. As existing methodologies addressing double counting are inconsistent and flawed, we propose a new framework, termed "total value redeemable (TVR)", to assess the true underlying value of DeFi. Our formal analysis reveals how DeFi's complex network spreads financial contagion via derivative tokens, increasing TVL's sensitivity to external shocks. To quantify double counting, we construct the DeFi multiplier, which mirrors the money multiplier in traditional finance (TradFi). This measurement reveals substantial double counting in DeFi, finding that the gap between TVL and TVR reached \$139.87 billion during the peak of DeFi activity on December 2, 2021, with a TVL-to-TVR ratio of approximately 2. We conduct sensitivity tests to evaluate the stability of TVL compared to TVR, demonstrating the former's significantly higher level of instability than the latter, especially during market downturns: A 25% decline in the price of Ether (ETH) leads to a \$1 billion greater non-linear decrease in TVL compared to TVR via the liquidations triggered by derivative tokens. We also document that the DeFi money multiplier is positively correlated with crypto market indicators and negatively correlated with macroeconomic indicators. Overall, our findings suggest that TVR is more reliable and stable than TVL.</description>

      <title>Chronologically Consistent Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21206v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in social sciences, but their training data can introduce lookahead bias and training leakage. A good chronologically consistent language model requires efficient use of training data to maintain accuracy despite time-restricted data. Here, we overcome this challenge by training a suite of chronologically consistent large language models, ChronoBERT and ChronoGPT, which incorporate only the text data that would have been available at each point in time. Despite this strict temporal constraint, our models achieve strong performance on natural language processing benchmarks, outperforming or matching widely used models (e.g., BERT), and remain competitive with larger open-weight models. Lookahead bias is model and application-specific because even if a chronologically consistent language model has poorer language comprehension, a regression or prediction model applied on top of the language model can compensate. In an asset pricing application predicting next-day stock returns from financial news, we find that ChronoBERT and ChronoGPT's real-time outputs achieve Sharpe ratios comparable to a much larger Llama model, indicating that lookahead bias is modest. Our results demonstrate a scalable, practical framework to mitigate training leakage, ensuring more credible backtests and predictions across finance and other social science domains.</description>

      <title>Market-Based Portfolio Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The variance measures the portfolio risks the investors are taking. The investor, who holds his portfolio and doesn't trade his shares, at the current time can use the time series of the market trades that were made during the averaging interval with the securities of his portfolio and assess the current return, variance, and hence the current risks of his portfolio. We show how the time series of trades with the securities of the portfolio determine the time series of trades with the portfolio as a single market security. The time series of trades with the portfolio determine its return and variance in the same form as the time series of trades with securities determine their returns and variances. The description of any portfolio and any single market security is equal. The time series of the portfolio trades define the decomposition of the portfolio variance by its securities, which is a quadratic form in the variables of relative amounts invested into securities. Its coefficients themselves are quadratic forms in the variables of relative numbers of shares of its securities. If one assumes that the volumes of all consecutive deals with each security are constant, the decomposition of the portfolio variance coincides with Markowitz's (1952) variance, which ignores the effects of random trade volumes. The use of the variance that accounts for the randomness of trade volumes could help majors like BlackRock, JP Morgan, and the U.S. Fed to adjust their models, like Aladdin and Azimov, to the reality of random markets.</description>
