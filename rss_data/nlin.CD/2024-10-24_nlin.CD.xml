      <title>Path planning for multi-quadrotor 3D boundary surveillance using non-autonomous discrete memristor hyperchaotic system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chaotic maps are well-suited for applications requiring unpredictable behaviour, making them a valuable tool for enhancing unpredictability and complexity. A method is developed using 3D parametric equations to make boundary surveillance more robust and flexible to effectively cover and adapt to the ever-changing situations of boundary surveillance. A non-autonomous discrete memristor hyperchaotic map is utilized to significantly enhance the unpredictability of trajectories in boundary surveillance. Since the scaling property is an affine transformation, and the hyperchaotic systems are invariant under affine transformations, the adaptability of hyperchaotic trajectories is visually demonstrated by applying the scaling property for robust path planning. Furthermore, hyperchaotic systems enable the generation of mutually independent trajectories with slight variations in initial conditions, allowing multiple quadrotors to operate simultaneously along a single guiding path. This minimizes the chance of overlap and interference, ensuring effective and coordinated surveillance.</description>

      <title>Optical next generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks with internal dynamics exhibit remarkable capability in processing information. Reservoir computing (RC) is a canonical example that features rich computing expressivity and compatibility with physical implementations for enhanced efficiency. Recently, a new RC paradigm known as next generation reservoir computing (NGRC) further improves expressivity but compromises its physical openness, posing challenges for realizations in physical systems. Here we demonstrate optical NGRC with computations performed by light scattering through disordered media. In contrast to conventional optical RC implementations, we drive our optical reservoir directly with time-delayed inputs. Much like digital NGRC that relies on polynomial features of delayed inputs, our optical reservoir also implicitly generates these polynomial features for desired functionalities. By leveraging the domain knowledge of the reservoir inputs, we show that the optical NGRC not only predicts the short-term dynamics of the low-dimensional Lorenz63 and large-scale Kuramoto-Sivashinsky chaotic time series, but also replicates their long-term ergodic properties. Optical NGRC shows superiority in shorter training length, increased interpretability and fewer hyperparameters compared to conventional optical RC based on scattering media, while achieving better forecasting performance. Our optical NGRC framework may inspire the realization of NGRC in other physical RC systems, new applications beyond time-series processing, and the development of deep and parallel architectures broadly.</description>
