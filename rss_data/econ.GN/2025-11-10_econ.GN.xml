      <title>Clearing Up the Effective Lower Bound Morass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depending on the persistence of the underlying Markov chain shock, the standard New Keynesian model predicts starkly different conclusions at the Effective Lower Bound. We clear up this morass by using a truncated Markov chain. We prove that the expectations-driven trap \`a la Mertens &amp; Ravn (2014) doesn't arise as an equilibrium outcome. In addition, the equilibrium under a truncated Markov chain is guaranteed to be unique, the effect of government spending is positive on consumption and does not switch signs but may grow unbounded \textemdash a puzzle.</description>

      <title>Election and Subjective Well-Being:Evidence from the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper uses daily Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data to estimate the causal effect of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, a highly competitive race whose outcome resolved lingering uncertainty on election day, on mental-health and life-satisfaction outcomes through a regression discontinuity design. Following the resolution of electoral uncertainty on election day, we find a sharp and persistent post-election decline in subjective well-being, concentrated among female, non-White, urban, and more-educated respondents. These findings reveal an expected-outcome shock, showing that political polarization itself, not electoral surprise, can act as a chronic psychological stressor.</description>

      <title>Impacts of large-scale food fortification on the cost of nutrient-adequate diets: a modeling study in 89 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale food fortification (LSFF) is a widely accepted intervention to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies, yet policy implementation is often incomplete and its effects on diet costs are not well established. We estimated the extent to which LSFF reduces the cost of nutrient-adequate diets using retail food prices and fortification policy data from 89 countries. In total, we modeled 5,874 least-cost diets across 22 sex-age groups and 3 nutrient-adequacy scenarios: meeting nutrient requirements only; adding minimum intakes for starchy staples and fruits and vegetables; and aligning food group shares with national consumption patterns. Assuming 90% implementation of existing LSFF standards, we found median cost reductions of 1.7%, 2.4%, and 4.5% across the three scenarios. Cost reductions varied widely by sex-age groups, national fortification strategies and food price structures. These findings highlight that LSFF may improve diet affordability when policies are carefully designed for local contexts, making it a valuable complement to other efforts that improve access to nutritious diets.</description>

      <title>Local Technological Access, Income Disparities, and Job-Seeking in the United States Since 2010</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the modern U.S. labor market, digital infrastructures strongly influence how individuals locate opportunities, build skills, and advance wages. Regional differences in computing access, broadband coverage, and digital literacy have significant labor implications for equity and sustainability. Drawing on longitudinal data from the NLSY97 (National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth) cohort, this study examines how place-based technological factors, personal demographics, household characteristics, and education shape income levels and decisions to seek new employment. The regression analyses reveal that educational attainment, marital status, and frequency of Internet usage strongly predict both wages and individuals' job-seeking intensity. Regional disparities in income underscore the need for more localized interventions to ensure equitable access to technology. This study raises key questions about how digital infrastructures can reinforce or challenge systemic inequalities in underserved communities.</description>

      <title>Blameocracy: Causal Rhetoric in Politics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the supply and effects of causal rhetoric in U.S. politics. We define causal rhetoric as assigning responsibility for political outcomes, via claims of blame and merit. Training a supervised classifier, we detect causal rhetoric in over a decade of congressional tweets, finding that its supply has risen rapidly and pervasively, displacing affective messaging. We show that the production of causal rhetoric involves a trade-off between revenues and costs. First, quasi-random variation in Twitter adoption shows that blame increases small-donor revenues by expanding donor count, while merit raises average donation size. Second, fine-grained legislative data suggest that policy ownership determines relative costs: blame is cheaper for opponents, merit for proposers. Finally, causal rhetoric has downstream effects on societal outcomes, fostering protest activity and shaping polarization and institutional trust.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mechanism Design using Multi-Agent Revealed Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a sequence of independent one-shot non-cooperative games where agents play equilibria determined by a tunable mechanism. Observing only equilibrium decisions, without parametric or distributional knowledge of utilities, we aim to steer equilibria towards social optimality, and to certify when this is impossible due to the game's structure. We develop an adaptive RL framework for this mechanism design objective. First, we derive a multi-agent revealed-preference test for Pareto optimality that gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of utilities under which the empirically observed mixed-strategy Nash equilibria are socially optimal. The conditions form a tractable linear program. Using this, we build an IRL step that computes the Pareto gap, the distance of observed strategies from Pareto optimality, and couple it with a policy-gradient update. We prove convergence to a mechanism that globally minimizes the Pareto gap. This yields a principled achievability test: if social optimality is attainable for the given game and observed equilibria, Algorithm 1 attains it; otherwise, the algorithm certifies unachievability while converging to the mechanism closest to social optimality. We also show a tight link between our loss and robust revealed-preference metrics, allowing algorithmic suboptimality to be interpreted through established microeconomic notions. Finally, when only finitely many i.i.d. samples from mixed strategies (partial strategy specifications) are available, we derive concentration bounds for convergence and design a distributionally robust RL procedure that attains the mechanism-design objective for the fully specified strategies.</description>

      <title>Fair Document Valuation in LLM Summaries via Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI assistants. While these systems enhance user experience through coherent summaries, they obscure the individual contributions of original content creators, raising concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries by proposing a Shapley value-based framework for fair document valuation. Although theoretically appealing, exact Shapley value computation is prohibitively expensive at scale. To improve efficiency, we develop Cluster Shapley, a simple approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity among documents to reduce computation while maintaining attribution accuracy. Using Amazon product review data, we empirically show that off-the-shelf Shapley approximations, such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP, perform suboptimally in LLM settings, whereas Cluster Shapley substantially improves the efficiency-accuracy frontier. Moreover, simple attribution rules (e.g., equal or relevance-based allocation), though computationally cheap, lead to highly unfair outcomes. Together, our findings highlight the potential of structure-aware Shapley approximations tailored to LLM summarization and offer guidance for platforms seeking scalable and fair content attribution mechanisms.</description>
