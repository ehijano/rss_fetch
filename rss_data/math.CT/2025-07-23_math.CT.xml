      <title>A Model of Type Theory in Groupoid Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the category Grpd(Asm$(A)$) of groupoids defined internally to the category of assemblies on a partial combinatory algebra $A$. In this thesis we exhibit the structure of a $\pi$-tribe on Grpd(Asm$(A)$) showing the category to be a model of type theory. We also show that Grpd(Asm$(A)$) has $W$-types with reductions and univalent object classifier for assemblies and modest assemblies, where the latter is an impredicative object classifier. Using the $W$-types with reductions, we show that Grpd(Asm$(A)$) has a model structure. Finally, we construct pGrpd(Asm$(A)$), the full subcategory of partitioned groupoid assemblies, and show that pGrpd(Asm$(A)$) has finite bilimits and bicolimits as well as showing that the homotopy category of the full subcategory of the $0$-types of pGrpd(Asm$(A)$) is RT$[A]$, the realizability topos of $A$.</description>

      <title>Genus Zero Kashiwara-Vergne Solutions from Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the language of moperads-monoids in the category of right modules over an operad-we reinterpret the Alekseev-Enriquez-Torossian construction of Kashiwara-Vergne (KV) solutions from associators. We show that any isomorphism between the moperad of parenthesized braids with a frozen strand and the moperad of chord diagrams gives rise to a family of genus zero KV solutions operadically generated by a single classical KV solution. We show that the Grothendieck-Teichm\"uller module groups act on the latter, intertwining the actions of the KV symmetry groups. In the other direction, we show that any symmetric KV solution gives rise to a morphism from the moperad of parenthesized braids with a frozen strand to the moperad of tangential automorphisms of free Lie algebras. This morphism factors through the moperad of chord diagrams if and only if the associated KV associator is a Drinfeld associator.</description>

      <title>Takeuchi-Schneider equivalence and calculi for homogeneous spaces of Hopf algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a notion of covariant differential calculus for Hopf algebroids. As a byproduct, we prove analogues of the fundamental theorem of Hopf modules and a Takeuchi-Schneider equivalence in the realm of Hopf algebroids. The resulting categorical equivalences enable us to classify covariant calculi on Hopf algebroids and, more in general, covariant calculi on quantum homogeneous spaces in this context, in terms of substructures of the augmentation ideal. This generalises the well-known classification results of Woronowicz and Hermisson. A particular focus is given on examples, including covariant calculi on the Ehresmann-Schauenburg Hopf algebroid of a faithfully flat Hopf-Galois extension, and covariant calculi on scalar extension Hopf algebroids, as well as homogeneous space variants of the latter.</description>

      <title>Rewriting techniques for relative coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18170v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of works has established rewriting as an essential tool in order to prove coherence properties of algebraic structures, such as MacLane's coherence theorem for monoidal categories, based on the observation that, under reasonable assumptions, confluence diagrams for critical pairs provide the required coherence axioms. We are interested here in extending this approach simultaneously in two directions. Firstly, we want to take into account situations where coherence is partial, in the sense that it only applies to a subset of the structural morphisms. Secondly, we are interested in structures which are cartesian in the sense that variables can be duplicated or erased. We develop theorems and rewriting techniques in order to achieve this, first in the setting of abstract rewriting systems, and then extend them to term rewriting systems, suitably generalized to take coherence into account. As an illustration of our results, we explain how to recover the coherence theorems for monoidal and symmetric monoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Formalizing colimits in Cat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certain results involving "higher structures" are not currently accessible to computer formalization because the prerequisite $\infty$-category theory has not been formalized. To support future work on formalizing $\infty$-category theory in Lean's mathematics library, we formalize some fundamental constructions involving the 1-category of categories. Specifically, we construct the left adjoint to the nerve embedding of categories into simplicial sets, defining the homotopy category functor. We prove further that this adjunction is reflective, which allows us to conclude that Cat has colimits. To our knowledge this is the first formalized proof that the nerve functor is a fully faithful right adjoint and that the category of categories is cocomplete.</description>

      <title>The concept of nullity in general spaces and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of nullity is present in all discourses of mathematics. The two most familiar notions of nullity are "almost-every" and "almost none". A notion of nullity corresponds to a choice of subsets that one interprets as null or non-empty. The rationale behind this choice depends on the context, such as Topology or Measure theory. One also expects that the morphisms or transformations within the contexts preserve the nullity structures. Extending this idea, a generalized notion of nullity is presented as a functor between categories. A constructive procedure is presented for extending the notion of nullity to categories with richer structure. Thus nullity in a category, such as that of general vector spaces, can be provided a recursive definition. Thus nullity is an arbitrary construct, which can be extended to broader contexts using well defined rules. These rules are succinctly expressed by right and left Kan extensions.</description>

      <title>Tables of practical invariants for distinguishing multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses to what extent the census of multiplicity-free fusion categories up to rank 7, proposed by the software package Anyonica and the anyonwiki website, can be regarded as a proper classification. The questions of correctness and completeness are briefly discussed, and the question of inequivalence of the provided categories is resolved under the assumption that all proposed data is correct. This is done by providing tables of small sets of invariants for these categories, for which (a) their invariance under automorphisms can be checked manually, and (b) the (in)equivalence of two skeletal fusion categories can be checked manually. These invariants can also be used to identify the category on the anyonwiki that corresponds to one for which the skeletal data is known.</description>

      <title>The Joys of Categorical Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model. Its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool, though, has remained conceptually opaque: While Conformal Prediction Regions (CPRs) give an ordinal representation of uncertainty (larger regions typically indicate higher uncertainty), they lack the capability to cardinally quantify it (twice as large regions do not imply twice the uncertainty). We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges (and perhaps subsumes) the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break the global coverage guarantee.</description>
